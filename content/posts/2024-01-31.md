### Summary

 Intel's new CEO, Brian Krzanich, is taking over during a challenging time for the company. The author suggests that Intel should shift from being an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) to becoming a foundry that serves external customers. However, Krzanich did not follow this advice, and Intel's stock suffered during his tenure. The author criticizes Krzanich's lack of strategic foresight and execution, pointing to Intel losing its process leadership to TSMC. Krzanich was later fired, and current CEO Pat Gelsinger is now facing difficulties as well. Intel's recent earnings announcement disappointed analysts, with concerns about weakening demand and struggling non-CPU businesses. Gelsinger expressed optimism for the future and emphasized the importance of Intel's manufacturing efforts. Overall, Intel is facing challenges in staying competitive in the market.

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the introduction of Custom GPTs by OpenAI and highlights their advantages over traditional plugins. It mentions that over 3 million GPTs have been created since the release, with over 200,000 of them being made publicly available. Custom GPTs come with pre-configured actions and specific knowledge for the tasks they are built for. Users can easily switch conversations depending on the task, resulting in a faster and more intuitive experience. The article also mentions that GPTs can be listed on the GPT Store or shared via a direct URL, leading to more availability compared to plugins. Adding knowledge to GPTs is as easy as uploading a file, such as PDFs or raw text. GPT creators can provide conversation starters based on the GPT's capabilities, and integration with product APIs is recommended for better user discovery. GPTs can now be mentioned within conversations of another GPT. The article concludes by discussing the main benefits of creating GPTs, including impactful results with minimal effort, leveraging existing product APIs, defining actions with different authentication models, and utilizing ChatGPT as a user acquisition channel. However, it also mentions some limitations and challenges, such as the accessibility of GPTs only to ChatGPT Plus users, restrictions on file uploads, and the need for clearer error messages.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes personal experiences with two platforms, GPT-3 and GPT-5. The author claims that both platforms suffer from reliability issues and are primarily used for data acquisition and alpha testing. The interfaces are said to be unstable and the inference process deliberately made non-deterministic with limited control to avoid negative publicity. The author also mentions that using the VITS module to analyze images fails frequently, with GPT-5 opting for alternative methods or generating faulty code. The platforms are criticized for constant silent finetuning, system prompt changes, and unstable models or APIs. Overall, the author believes that these platforms are more like tech demos intended to gather training data from users.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that custom GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) are essentially plugins that function by using a carefully written system prompt and basic middleware to scan output and occasionally take control. Although they may have a different user experience, there is no significant technical difference or innovation with custom GPTs. The primary benefit of both plugins and custom GPTs is that they are first-party, meaning they are developed or purchased directly. The author sarcastically commends OpenAI for using the term "GPTs," which they believe creates confusion about OpenAI's offering and people's understanding of Language Model Managers (LLMs) in general.
