## 3. [Compromising OpenWrt Supply Chain](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42363102)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 **Summary:**

RyotaK, a security engineer at Flatt Security Inc., investigated the Attended Sysupgrade feature of OpenWrt after upgrading his home lab network. This feature uses an online service at `sysupgrade.openwrt.org` to build custom firmware images based on user selections. Here are the key points from his investigation:

1. **Functionality**: The service builds firmware by receiving user specifications on device and packages, then returns a custom image for flashing.

2. **Security Concerns**: The process of building images with user-provided packages could potentially be insecure if not properly isolated. The service uses containers for isolation.

3. **Vulnerabilities Found**:
   - **Command Injection**: A vulnerability was found in the Makefile where user-controlled variables could execute arbitrary commands due to improper quoting.
   - **Hash Collision**: The hashing mechanism used for build caching was vulnerable to collisions due to truncation of hash lengths, potentially allowing attackers to retrieve incorrect firmware.

4. **Investigation and Testing**:
   - RyotaK set up a local instance of the service to safely test vulnerabilities.
   - He attempted to escape the container but focused on proving the hash collision vulnerability by brute-forcing SHA-256 hashes, initially with a custom OpenCL program and later with Hashcat.

5. **Outcome**: While the container escape was not fully achieved, significant security weaknesses were identified and demonstrated, highlighting potential risks in the firmware building process.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a significant security concern regarding the customization and distribution of software, particularly focusing on the lack of transparency in how software builds are managed for individual users or devices. Here are the key points:

1. **Custom Software Builds**: There is a growing practice of generating software builds tailored for specific users or devices without validation or reproducibility. This practice increases the risk of incorporating malicious code (backdoors) since there is no public log or ability for third-party verification.

2. **Need for Transparency**: The author suggests that users should have access to the same software builds as security researchers like Andres Freund to check for potential supply chain attacks. This transparency would allow for the detection of any malicious insertions.

3. **Examples of Transparency Efforts**:
   - **Mozilla**: Attempted to log release builds in a Merkle tree for transparency but abandoned the project.
   - **Google**: Has implemented transparency measures for Pixel firmware but apps via Google Play Store remain vulnerable due to a lack of similar logging.
   - **Apple**: Criticized for having less transparency with their firmware and app distribution, specifically targeting builds to individual devices with no public logs.

4. **Best Practice Example**: Gentoo’s ebuild repository is highlighted as an example of good binary transparency, utilizing a single Git repository (Merkle tree) for source checksums, making it one of the largest and most distributed systems of its kind.

5. **Post-Incident Actions**: Following the discovery of a backdoor in xz-utils, some researchers have started scanning open source software builds for high entropy files that might hide malicious code. However, this approach is not feasible for custom builds unless every build is publicly logged.

The article emphasizes the importance of implementing and maintaining transparency in software distribution to safeguard against supply chain attacks, advocating for systems where every build is logged and verifiable.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a security concern related to the use of `"".join()` in string concatenation within a function that generates a hash. Specifically, it points out that concatenating multiple fields with `"".join()` allows for potential manipulation where characters can be shifted between fields without altering the resulting hash.
