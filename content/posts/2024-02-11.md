## 1. [I designed a cube that balances itself on a corner](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39336139)

**Total comment counts : 56**

### Summary

 The article discusses Willem Pennings' personal project of building a cube that can balance itself on a corner and rotate around its axis. The cube is inspired by the "Cubli" created by researchers at ETH Zürich, but Pennings has made improvements to the design. The cube's mechanical structure consists of cornerstones and face plates, with three of the face plates supporting a motor and reaction wheel assembly. Pennings used stainless steel for most of the structural parts and aluminum for the face plates to save weight. He manufactured the metal parts with the help of PCBWay. The motor and flywheel assembly were carefully designed to be robust and lightweight. Pennings explains the assembly process in detail, including mounting the reaction wheel and securing the motor shaft with ball bearings. The end result is a strong and lightweight structure. Overall, the project is a learning experience and research endeavor, with potential applications in satellite attitude control.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 During the COVID pandemic, the author needed to set up remote piano lessons. Initially, they tried merging two videos to show both the hands on the keys and the face, but encountered latency issues. They solved this problem by using a top-down camera angle and placing clear perspex at a 45-degree angle in front of the raised laptop. They also directed lamps at the piano player's face using the Pepper's Ghost effect. This allowed the teacher to see both the hands on the keyboard and the player's face through one camera, and made it appear as if the player was looking directly into the camera. The author shared their solution to help others facing similar challenges.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a webMIDI app that recently shipped. The author congratulates the developers on their achievement and mentions that they have been working on a similar app with a multiplayer feature in mind. They inquire about the latency of the app and provide feedback on the landing page and app functionality. The author suggests adding a video example on the landing page, allowing visitors to try the piano before prompting login for remote features, and addressing confusing clickable buttons. They also share their experience with the app, mentioning that connecting the keyboard worked well but pressing keys with a mouse did not produce any sound. They also note that pressing keys on their MIDI keyboard caused the keys to be selected indefinitely, preventing them from being pressed again. The author offers assistance and wishes the developers good luck with further development.

## 8. [A man has been swatted 47 times for making a joke about Norm Macdonald](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39331771)

**Total comment counts : 63**

### Summary

 This article discusses the rise of "swatting," a dangerous prank where individuals call in false bomb threats or mass shootings in order to send heavily armed police teams to the target's location. The article highlights the case of a teenager in California who allegedly operated a swatting service and targeted hundreds of high schools, churches, and even the US Supreme Court. The teenager charged as little as $40 for his services and would post audio of the 911 calls as proof. The article also mentions a science fiction author in Milwaukee who has been swatted multiple times as part of a targeted harassment campaign. Despite arrests being made in some cases, the article points out that law enforcement is struggling to effectively handle the threat of swatting.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that in April 2023, the person in question was targeted by a "swatting" incident four times in a single day. During the fourth incident, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) dispatched six officers armed with assault rifles to the person's home at 9 PM. The author suggests that the MPD is partially responsible for allowing themselves to be manipulated in this way.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the deployment of the STIR/SHAKEN system and its impact on preventing fake calls to 911. The author questions how someone can still make a call with a fake number without it being identified. Despite the supposed deployment of STIR/SHAKEN in the US telephony network, public safety answering points (PSAPs) are apparently not yet equipped to detect the attestation level of such calls. The article provides a background document for further reference.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article shares their experience in setting up a home lab and choosing between Authelia and Keycloak for authentication and single sign-on (SSO). They mention that while Keycloak is a comprehensive solution, it requires additional services to work with traefik forward auth. On the other hand, Authelia is described as working well, although it lacks a user interface for editing users and does not have two-way synchronization with an LDAP server. However, they recommend Authelia as a good option for adding authentication and SSO to services, especially if static files and environment variables can be used for configuration.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience setting up a single sign-on (SSO) system for their homelab. They wanted to be able to log in with Google or GitHub authentication and tried using JetBrains Hub and Keycloak but found them difficult to set up. They eventually decided to use Dex, which was easy to set up with some basic YAML, a SQLite database, and a domain. They combined Dex with OAuth2 Proxy and a custom Nginx template for a simplified SSO configuration. They also added Cloudflare Access and WAF for security. The author provides links to the tools they used in their setup.

**Total comment counts : 50**

### Summary

 The author worked at GitLab from 2015 to 2021 and is now reflecting on their time there. They initially joined because they wanted to work on the Rubinius project, but also had a task to improve GitLab's performance. They had a lot of autonomy and went through many changes, including the company growing from around 30 employees to 2000. However, they eventually experienced burnout. They also mention the transition to remote work, and their small living arrangements at the time. Despite being a remote company, GitLab had social events and meetups.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article questions whether it is acceptable to pay employees less based on their location, comparing it to paying someone less because of their race or gender. The author suggests that location is a relevant factor in determining pay, as it involves setting up a subsidiary in the employee's country, dealing with legal and tax systems, and considering time zones and travel costs. The author argues that comparing location-based pay differentiations with discrimination based on race or gender hinders productive discussion by equating GitLab to a racist and sexist organization.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a common scenario in big companies where employees start with a lower rank and report directly to the CEO, but as more managers are added above them, they are eventually put on a performance improvement plan (PEP) and feel the need to leave. The author suggests that this is a reason why people in big companies often struggle to achieve great things. Additionally, even if an employee starts a successful project within a company, they can be easily surpassed by others who are then able to criticize their performance.
