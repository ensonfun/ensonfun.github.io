## 2. [Chrome now tracks users and shares a “topic” list with advertisers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37427227)

**Total comment counts : 49**

### Summary

 Google's "Privacy Sandbox," an ad platform that tracks web pages visited and generates a list of advertising topics to share with web pages, is receiving a widespread rollout in Chrome. This feature, previously known as "FLoC" and the "Topics API," has faced opposition but is being implemented by Google. The ad platform launch announcement is not as prominently featured as Chrome's recent redesign. Google justifies the platform as an alternative tracking solution, claiming that some form of tracking is necessary. Users can find controls for this feature in Chrome's settings. Google plans to block third-party cookies in 2024. The article questions whether users wanted a user-tracking and ad platform directly integrated into their browser and speculates that users are unlikely to switch to Firefox as a result.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article provides two options to fix a problem. The first option suggests going to the URL "chrome://settings/adPrivacy" and turning off the toggles on three subpages. The second option suggests visiting the URL "https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/" to permanently fix the problem.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article highlights several problems with the Privacy Sandbox project. Firstly, it points out that Privacy Sandbox is a project consisting of multiple proposals, so presenting it as a cohesive product is misleading. Additionally, the article clarifies that FLoC and Topics are separate components within the Privacy Sandbox project. The article also argues that Topics can essentially be achieved through third-party cookies, although it acknowledges that the proposal has some issues and may not provide the level of privacy protection that Google claims. Overall, the article disputes the notion that the Privacy Sandbox project is making Chrome less privacy-preserving.
