### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article provides a link to a supplemental data movie, which shows a participant running on a World of Data (WoD) from inside circular walls of Moon settlements. The running is considered a comprehensive countermeasure for low-gravity deconditioning.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of a "gravity gym" for low gravity environments, such as the Moon. The gym would consist of a tapered cylinder with adjustable angled walls and variable speed spinning to create a greater sense of gravity. This would enable various physical activities including body weight exercises, cardio, VR games, and even sleeping. The article also mentions that the idea of having a spinning surface for exercise would be a simpler challenge compared to other issues faced in low gravity environments, such as health deterioration and boredom. Additionally, the article suggests that this kind of equipment could potentially help with off-world childbearing and predicts that spin areas will become common in low gravity colonies.

## 2. [Cognition: A new antisyntax language redefining metaprogramming](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40231563)

**Total comment counts : 52**

### Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of Lisp and other programming languages in terms of metaprogramming and syntax. It introduces the concept of cognition, a new programming language that aims to solve these limitations. The article also provides an example code and explains the use of delimiters and ignored characters in cognition. The author is involved in the development of cognition and provides a link to the repository for more information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author advises the writer to prioritize important information and put it at the beginning of the article. They suggest that the actual project should be mentioned earlier, rather than discussing unrelated topics like Lisp. The author also suggests that the writer should inform the reader about the document's content right from the start to capture their interest.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of syntax bootstrapping and compares it to Racket's approach of configuring the reader layer. It mentions that while it's interesting to see this type of syntax bootstrapping, there may not be anything fundamentally better about it compared to Racket's approach. The article also briefly mentions how Rhombus, a tool for macros, operates on a "shrubbery" instead of an abstract syntax tree, providing some flexibility in extending the syntax of the language.

## 3. [ESpeak-ng: speech synthesizer with more than one hundred languages and accents](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40231630)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article provides information about eSpeak NG, an open-source speech synthesizer that supports over 100 languages and accents. It is available for Linux, Windows, Android, and other operating systems. The software utilizes a "formant synthesis" method, allowing for multiple languages to be supported in a compact size. While the speech produced by eSpeak NG is clear and can be used at high speeds, it may not be as natural or smooth as larger synthesizers based on human speech recordings. The project aims to clean up the existing codebase, add new features, and improve language support. eSpeak NG is released under the GPL version 3 or later license.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses classic speech synthesis methods, specifically focusing on formant synthesis. This approach uses simple sounds and modifies them based on the distinctions made by the human speech tract. The technique involves modeling vowel quality as changing sine waves and adding buzzing or clicking noises for consonants. By combining this technique with algorithms that can accurately translate English into phonetic tokens, speech synthesis can be achieved. The author expresses a sentiment of nostalgia for these classic approaches to artificial intelligence, as they required a deeper understanding of language. However, they acknowledge that deep learning has produced more advanced systems, although they may lack a similar level of understanding or simplicity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article, who is blind, shares that they use ESpeak-ng, a text-to-speech (TTS) software, on all their devices throughout their day. They explain that they started using ESpeak-ng in their childhood when other TTS options were slow and unresponsive. They briefly mention trying Vocalizer, the default TTS software on iOS and Mac OS, but switched back to ESpeak-ng when third-party support was added.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is developing a specialized UAV and is seeking insights on choosing the right system-on-chip (SOC) for their project. They want to develop the entire system as a single module for serial production and are interested in the Snapdragon SOCs due to their GPU capabilities. However, they are unsure about the process of procuring higher-end components and if there are minimum purchase quantities or production requirements. They also want to know if they can obtain datasheets for these components at an earlier stage of development. The author believes they may have to stick with the Jetson + Off-the-shelf camera approach until they can demonstrate the ability to mass produce and sell their existing designs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the increasing power of integrated graphics processing units (iGPUs) and predicts that they will soon become overpowered for everyday tasks such as video watching and browser gaming. It also suggests that iGPUs will eventually reach a level where they can handle high-end gaming at 1440p resolution and 120 frames per second, rendering dedicated graphics cards unnecessary for most users. The article concludes by stating that the future of GPUs will focus on supercomputing, and predicts that PCs will become smaller and more compact as iGPU technology advances.
