## 1. [Kelly Can't Fail](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42466676)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses the "Next Card Bet" game, a card game where a player bets on the color of the next card drawn from a shuffled deck of 56 cards (26 red, 26 black) with the goal of maximizing their stake. Here are the key points:

1. **Game Mechanics**: Players start with $1 and can bet any fraction of their current stake on whether the next card will be red or black, with a one-to-one payoff.

2. **Kelly Criterion**: The Kelly betting strategy, which aims to maximize the expected logarithm of the stake, is applied. The optimal bet fraction is calculated as `(r - b) / (r + b)`, where `r` is the number of red cards remaining and `b` is the number of black cards remaining.

3. **Zero Variance Strategy**: The article explains that the Kelly strategy in this game is risk-free with zero variance. This surprising result is demonstrated through a mathematical proof involving a portfolio of strategies:

   - **Portfolio Strategy**: Each possible arrangement of cards is considered, with one strategy in the portfolio correctly guessing the entire sequence of cards, leading to a significant multiplication of the stake, while all others lose all their money.

   - **Proof of Equivalence**: The portfolio strategy, when analyzed, shows identical payoffs to the Kelly strategy, thus proving that the Kelly strategy has zero variance because it's effectively identical to a zero-variance portfolio strategy.

4. **Implications**: The Kelly strategy in this context means that as long as bets are placed according to the formula, the player's stake will always grow in a predictable manner, regardless of the actual card order, due to the balance of wins and losses aligning with the increasing favorability of the deck.

The article concludes by highlighting the counterintuitive nature of this game where aggressive betting (Kelly criterion) leads to a risk-free outcome, showcasing an interesting application of probability and betting strategies in a gambling scenario.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a betting strategy where success depends on the ability to infinitely divide one's stake. It provides an example where, if the top half of a deck consists entirely of red cards, a player's initial $1 stake would be reduced to a minuscule amount before potentially recovering to over 9 times the original stake.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a mathematical proof by induction concerning a game or betting scenario involving red (r) and black (b) outcomes. Here are the key points:

1. **Base Case**: When the outcomes are (0,1) or (1,0), the payoff is always 2.

2. **Inductive Step**: If you're at a state (r,b) where r â‰¥ b, and you stake `(r-b)/(r+b)` on red:
   - **Winning (red)**: The payoff calculation results in `X * 2^(r+b) / (r+b choose r)`.
   - **Losing (black)**: The payoff calculation also simplifies to `X * 2^(r+b) / (r+b choose r)`.

This shows that regardless of whether you win or lose, the expected payoff remains consistent, proving the hypothesis by induction. The author suggests this proof is more straightforward than discussing portfolio strategies.

## 5. [My favourite colour is Chuck Norris red](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42468318)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 The article by Declan Chidlow discusses the quirks of HTML, particularly focusing on how older HTML attributes like `color` and `bgcolor` are handled by modern browsers. Here are the key points:

1. **HTML Color Attribute**: Historically, HTML used attributes like `color` for styling text, which is now considered obsolete. However, these attributes still work due to browser forgiveness.

2. **Browser Forgiveness**: Browsers are very lenient with HTML errors, trying to render pages even when encountering invalid or nonsensical values. For example, setting text color to "chucknorris" results in red text due to HTML parsing rules for legacy color values.

3. **Legacy Color Parsing**: The article explains how browsers parse invalid color values according to the HTML specification, converting them into usable RGB values or defaulting to colors like red when parsing fails.

4. **Fun with Parsing**: Chidlow created tools on CodePen to demonstrate and play with how browsers interpret invalid color inputs, showing how certain words coincidentally match expected colors (e.g., "Sonic" resulting in blue).

5. **CSS Peculiarities**: Although the color attribute is outdated, CSS has its own quirks, like clamping out-of-range RGB values rather than rejecting them, which maintains this forgiving nature of the web.

6. **Philosophical Take**: The author reflects on the forgiving nature of web technology, suggesting that this leniency adds to the charm and resilience of the web. He argues against a "perfect" web, valuing the ability of the web to handle and adapt to human errors and creative hacks.

7. **Conclusion**: The web's foundation is built on flexibility and resilience, allowing old and new technologies to coexist and function, which Chidlow finds essential to the web's magic and appeal.

The article also notes that while the original contributors to such content, like old Redditors or forum users, do not usually gain financially from their contributions, the Stack Overflow post in question does at least reference the original source at the end.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discussed was interesting, but the author made an error regarding the rendering of colors. Specifically, the author claimed that "chucknorris" is rendered as red, when in fact, the correct interpretation should be that the color red is rendered as "chucknorris."

## 6. [Ghost artists on Spotify](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42461530)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 The article discusses the issue of "ghost artists" on Spotify, a phenomenon where the streaming service was allegedly filling its playlists with tracks by pseudonymous or fake artists, possibly to lower royalty payments. Initially reported in 2017, the issue gained traction after various music industry insiders and publications like Vulture and NPR highlighted the problem. Spotify denied creating these tracks but did not clarify if they had added them to playlists. 

Further investigation showed that many of these artists were linked to stock music libraries like Epidemic Sound, with their profiles often lacking personal details and featuring generic images. Over time, the controversy was overshadowed by other Spotify news, such as its venture into podcasting and deals with high-profile personalities like Joe Rogan. However, the issue resurfaced in 2022 when a Swedish newspaper investigation revealed that a small group of songwriters were behind hundreds of these ghost artists, whose tracks had been streamed millions of times on Spotify. This led to renewed scrutiny of Spotify's practices regarding artist royalties and playlist curation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explores the creation of chill, lo-fi, and ambient playlists, focusing on how services like Spotify utilize stock music companies to produce this content. Contrary to the notion of AI replacing artists, these playlists are made with real musicians, specifically underemployed jazz musicians, who are hired to quickly produce derivative music in bulk. The process involves musicians playing basic, often one-take sessions, guided by minimal direction to fit the playlist aesthetic. The author suggests an alternative for listeners to support real artists by seeking out named jazz musicians, listening to local jazz stations, or attending live jazz performances instead of relying on algorithm-driven playlists.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the Seeburg 1000, an early background music system from the 1950s used in commercial spaces like restaurants and stores. Here are the key points:

- **Business Model**: Seeburg 1000 was a subscription service where new sets of 1,000 songs on disks were delivered periodically to subscribers. This model predates modern streaming services but shares similarities in providing ongoing music content.

- **Music Production**: The music was produced by Seeburg's own orchestra, focusing on songs in the public domain or those for which they had acquired unlimited rights, akin to today's "ghost artists."

- **Technology**: The system used records with unique copy protection features like non-standard RPM, size, hole size, and groove width, which meant Seeburg did not always file for copyrights, leading to some of this content being available online today.

- **Equipment**: Unlike their jukeboxes which had random access capabilities, the Seeburg 1000 background music player was simpler, playing a continuous loop of records. The audio quality was low-fi due to the slow playback speed of 16 2/3 RPM which limits the frequency response.

- **Legacy**: The system represents an early form of what would evolve into modern background music services, showing that the concept of subscription-based music delivery has historical precedence.

## 9. [How concurrecy works: A visual guide](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42450227)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 **Summary:**

The article discusses the complexities of concurrent programming and introduces the concept of **model checking** as a method to verify the correctness of concurrent systems. It emphasizes the importance of visualizing the state space of programs to understand their behavior, especially in concurrent environments. The author explains:

1. **State and State Space**: A program's state is defined by the values of its variables and the location counter. The state space is all possible states the program can go through.

2. **Visualization**: Using simple examples in a C-like language, the article shows how to visualize sequential and concurrent program execution through state transitions. This helps in understanding how programs move from one state to another.

3. **Model Checking**: The author advocates for formal verification through model checking, quoting Leslie Lamport to underline the necessity of rigorous thinking in concurrent programming. Model checking involves examining all possible states to ensure the program behaves as expected.

4. **Learning and Resources**: The article is part of the author's exploration into concurrency and model checking, aiming to share insights and learning resources with others to better comprehend and design concurrent systems.

The article concludes by suggesting that even though visualizing and verifying complex systems can be challenging, breaking them into smaller, manageable models can significantly aid in understanding and ensuring the correctness of concurrent programs.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The critique of the article highlights its failure to address **weak memory models**, which are crucial in modern multiprocessor/multicore systems. The article's focus on model checking under the assumption of sequential consistency is misleading because:

- **Weak memory models** allow for reordering of reads and writes by both compilers and hardware, making traditional concurrent programming assumptions incorrect.
- Without considering mechanisms like atomic operations or memory barriers, programming for such systems becomes extremely challenging, if not impossible, due to these reorderings.
- By not discussing these aspects, the article perpetuates misconceptions about concurrent programming, leading to confusion among readers about the realities of programming in current hardware environments.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges and pitfalls of concurrent programming on real computers. It highlights that:

1. **Optimizers** can alter the execution order of statements, potentially breaking assumptions about the order of operations.
2. **Hardware** might reorder memory writes, adding complexity to maintaining the correct sequence of operations.

The main advice given is that when multiple threads access the same memory location, especially if at least one thread is writing to it, this can lead to errors. To mitigate these issues, the article recommends using synchronization mechanisms like **mutexes** or **atomic variables** to ensure safe and predictable behavior in concurrent environments.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a game engine design inspired by Redux architecture, where game states and actions are managed similarly to state management in user interfaces. Here are the key points:

1. **Redux-like Architecture**: The engine uses a state type to hold game data (e.g., piece positions in chess) and a stream of actions (e.g., moving a piece). Each action triggers a pure function that updates the game state.

2. **Network and UI Benefits**: This approach facilitates:
   - Optimistic updates where the UI reflects actions before server confirmation.
   - Rollback and replay functionalities.
   - Automated testing.
   - Recovery from disconnections by either syncing state deltas or transmitting actions.

3. **Challenges with Representation**: While this architecture is beneficial for UI rendering (like using React with the state as a prop), it becomes cumbersome for games with complex logic akin to computer programs, involving control flow, branching, and other programming constructs.

4. **Proposed Solution**: The author proposes an alternative game engine design where game logic would be represented as conventional code rather than a series of state changes. This approach would require advanced language features like serialization of suspended asynchronous functions, which are not yet mainstream. 

The article reflects on the potential and limitations of using a Redux-like state management system for game engines, suggesting that while it has many advantages, a more code-centric approach might be better suited for games with intricate rule sets.
