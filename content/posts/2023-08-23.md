### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the recent mission by ISRO and their approach to software development. In the past, their missions were designed to select a precise spot or trajectory and make necessary corrections to reach it. This time, however, they prioritized safety by focusing on maintaining altitude, speed, and heading within normal limits while descending towards the target. They also decided not to make any corrections if they were too far off the target and it exceeded safety limits. This approach traded off accuracy for safety.

## 2. [Eye scans detect signs of Parkinson’s disease up to seven years before diagnosis](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37230843)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 A team of researchers led by Siegfried Wagner and Pearse Keane of Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology have identified markers that indicate the presence of Parkinson's disease in patients an average of seven years before clinical presentation. This is the first time these findings have been shown several years before diagnosis, and they were made possible through the largest study to date on retinal imaging in Parkinson's disease. The study used artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze eye scans and identified markers of Parkinson's. The findings were replicated in the wider UK Biobank database. The use of large datasets enabled the identification of subtle markers, even though Parkinson's has a relatively low prevalence. Previous research has also used eye scans to reveal signs of other neurodegenerative conditions. High-resolution images of the retina, obtained through scans such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), have become routine in eye care and can provide insight into overall health. Researchers have used machine learning to analyze these images and uncover hidden information about the whole body, a field referred to as oculomics. The collaboration between various institutions and the use of eye data has the potential to detect early signs of Parkinson's and open up new possibilities for treatment. The researchers hope that this method could become a pre-screening tool for individuals at risk of disease, allowing for early intervention and prevention of neurodegenerative disorders.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a research paper that examines the overlap between prodromal Parkinson's patients and control patients. It suggests that although there are some measures that can be almost conclusive in identifying Parkinson's, there are also ranges where the overlap is significant, making it less useful as a sole measure without a high false positive rate. The article suggests that while the research shows promise in early detection of Parkinson's, it may not be able to achieve both a good false positive and false negative rate. It also mentions that the article is a press release summarizing a more conservative publication.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions two companies, RightEye and Neuralight, that are developing portable eye-tracking tests. RightEye's test can detect concussions and reading problems in five minutes, while Neuralight aims to track conditions like ALS and Parkinson's using an ordinary webcam. The data collected by these tests is helpful in indicating the need for further medical evaluation, as they can detect certain early symptoms before they become more prominent.

 The Vagus nerve can be stimulated by conscious breathing, which has a direct impact on our psychology and physiology. This is why practices like yoga and Buddhism emphasize the importance of breathing. Two books that delve into this topic are "Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art" and "Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Brain."

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of a Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) device called Sentiva 1000 in the treatment of severe epilepsy. The device has been implanted in a child who previously experienced seizures and has greatly helped in reducing their frequency. The settings of the device were gradually adjusted over a nine-month period. While the child still had seizures at night, they were addressed with a different treatment. The Sentiva 1000 sends regular soft pulses and can react to sudden increases in heart rate, potentially indicating a seizure, by increasing pulses automatically. A strong magnet can be used to manually activate the device during a seizure, causing it to send stronger pulses. The batteries of the device last about eight years and can be checked using an iPad and a wand-like device. When the battery needs to be changed, it will require another operation, but it is less complicated than the initial implantation. Overall, the use of the Sentiva 1000 device has been effective in managing the child's epilepsy.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's work on a tool for database migrations. The author compares their tool to existing tools that parse SQL and highlight "dangerous" locks but lack context and don't account for changes or schema-specific information. The author questions the need to interpret the Postgres source code and convert it into human-readable form in order to understand the locks or rewrites a DDL statement will perform, suggesting instead to directly obtain this information from Postgres. The author wonders if they are missing something.
