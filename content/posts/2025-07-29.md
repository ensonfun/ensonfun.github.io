## 1. [Enough AI copilots, we need AI HUDs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44705445)

**Total comment counts : 85**

### Summary

 Mark Weiser's 1992 critique of AI design highlights the limitations of the "copilot" metaphor for AI, advocating instead for a focus on "invisible computers" that enhance human awareness. He contrasts the copilot model, which actively assists, with the concept of a Head-Up Display (HUD) that seamlessly integrates information into the user's perception. Modern examples include spellcheck and custom debugging tools that augment human understanding without direct interaction. Weiser suggests that while virtual copilots may be useful for routine tasks, empowering users with enhanced tools is crucial for achieving extraordinary outcomes.
