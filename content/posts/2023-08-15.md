## 2. [Internet Archive responds to recording industry lawsuit targeting obsolete media](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37128044)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 Some of the largest record labels, including Sony and Universal Music Group, have filed a lawsuit against the Internet Archive and others regarding the Great 78 Project. This project aims to preserve and provide public access to 78 rpm records that are several decades old. The Internet Archive, as a non-profit library, takes this matter seriously and is reviewing the lawsuit with legal counsel. The Great 78 Project has been operating since 2006 and has preserved hundreds of thousands of recordings stored on an obsolete medium called shellac resin. These preserved recordings retain the authentic analog artifacts, such as scratches and pops, which modern remastering techniques would remove. The Internet Archive emphasizes the importance of both platforms like Spotify for music listening and libraries like theirs for studying and researching original 78rpm sound recordings. The preserved recordings are used in teaching, research, and writing podcasts for student assignments. Despite the limited usage of these recordings, with an average of one researcher accessing each recording per month, the Internet Archive remains dedicated to its mission of providing universal access to knowledge. They express gratitude for the support from library patrons and partners in fighting against these attacks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author disagrees with the length of copyright protection, but from a purely legal perspective, they do not see any defense for the Internet Archive (IA) in a copyright infringement case. The IA's argument seems to be that since the records are old and their work is for academic researchers, they should be able to copy and make copyrighted works available for free on the internet. The author speculates that the IA might be arguing fair use, but they do not think it applies in this case. They are interested in understanding if the IA has any legal defense that will hold up in court, without considering opinions about record companies, IA's work, copyright protection, or the unjustness of the law.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article suggests that copyright holders may view archiving as a threat because it could potentially invalidate their copyrights. They use the example of the Happy Birthday song, which was invalidated by an older work called "Good Morning to All." The author argues that with the existence of a database like this, it would be easy for someone to compare older music to newer music and find similarities that could potentially invalidate claims made by copyright holders. This could be a concern for copyright holders as it puts their current music catalogs at risk.

 The summary of the article is that the author, who works in a non-web industry, finds the post difficult to understand. They criticize the lack of explanation regarding how something was done "100x faster." The author also mentions the abundance of flow diagrams that provide little information and mention of something called P-States, which they find nebulous. They believe that the post assumes a shared basis of knowledge and would prefer an overview that contrasts typical approaches with the one presented in the post, along with a code comparison.

## 6. [The OpenTF Manifesto](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37133054)

**Total comment counts : 48**

### Summary

 The article discusses the recent change in the license of the infrastructure automation tool, Terraform, by HashiCorp. The switch from an open-source license to a non-open source Business Source License (BUSL) has created concerns within the community. Users are worried about potential legal risks and lack of clarity regarding competitive usage. The article argues that this change threatens the entire Terraform community and ecosystem built over the past nine years. The author suggests that the BUSL is a "poison pill" for Terraform, and as a result, the thriving ecosystem will dwindle, and developers and companies will turn to alternatives that are genuinely open-source. The article emphasizes the importance of open-source tools in building a solid foundation for the internet and asks HashiCorp to switch Terraform back to an open-source license. Alternatively, if the switch is not possible, the author proposes forking Terraform into a foundation, similar to how Linux and Kubernetes are managed. The article concludes by stating that the signatories pledge to pool resources to ensure the future of an open-source Terraform.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses appreciation for a letter and their initial respect for Hashicorp, but now suggests that it is time to fork it into a foundation without waiting for Hashicorp's response. They argue that private corporations cannot be trusted to maintain public goods, as they prioritize profits and growth above all else. The author believes that only community governed non-profit foundations can effectively uphold public goods.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Oxide's support for the OpenTF Manifesto, which advocates for an open source Terraform. While Oxide's Terraform provider remains MPLv2, they express concern about the ambiguity surrounding HashiCorp's move to the BSL license. Oxide supports the efforts to have an MPLv2 Terraform led by HashiCorp, but also agrees with the fallback position of forking Terraform into a foundation if necessary. The article emphasizes the importance of open source and the need to work together to ensure an open source future.
