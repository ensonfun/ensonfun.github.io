## 1. [Understanding gRPC, OpenAPI and REST and when to use them in API design (2020)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42799245)

**Total comment counts : 53**

### Summary

 The article discusses the primary models for API design, focusing on RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and REST (Representational State Transfer), and how these models interact with HTTP protocols:

1. **RPC vs. REST**: 
   - **RPC**: Focuses on procedures where data is encapsulated within calls. gRPC, a modern RPC framework, uses HTTP/2 but abstracts the HTTP layer from the developer.
   - **REST**: Emphasizes on resources where behaviors are derived from manipulating these resources. True REST APIs are rare, as many APIs labeled as REST do not adhere strictly to its principles.

2. **HTTP as a Transport**:
   - HTTP is widely used due to familiarity with its security measures and port usage (80 and 443). The article outlines three main approaches for API design using HTTP:
     - **REST**: Clients use URLs as-is without constructing them, adhering to the original intent of HTTP.
     - **gRPC**: Uses HTTP/2 but hides it behind RPC abstractions, making it easier for developers to focus on the service without worrying about HTTP specifics.
     - **OpenAPI**: Clients construct URLs from templates and parameters, which contrasts with RESTful principles but is popular for its clarity and ease of documentation.

3. **Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Modern APIs often blend elements from both RPC and REST. For example, using gRPC for implementation while adopting REST-like resource orientation, allowing for standard HTTP interactions.

4. **API Design Choices**:
   - The article explains that choosing between these models involves considering factors like the need for statelessness (REST), simplicity and efficiency (gRPC), or detailed specification and documentation (OpenAPI).

5. **Practical Implications**:
   - The choice of API style affects how clients interact with the API, how the API is documented, and how it's implemented. Each model has its advantages, with REST offering simplicity, gRPC providing performance with HTTP/2, and OpenAPI offering detailed specifications.

In summary, the article guides API designers through the landscape of current API design philosophies, highlighting how traditional models are evolving with new technologies and hybrid approaches, aiding developers in making informed decisions based on their project's needs.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses a strong regret over learning about gRPC, a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. The author details numerous frustrations encountered while using gRPC:

1. **Complexity and Debugging**: Despite claims that gRPC simplifies things by hiding internals, the author found themselves needing extensive debug logging to diagnose issues, particularly with inconsistent request failures.

2. **Configuration Overload**: The system requires tuning many settings related to timeouts and retries, which are poorly named and documented, leading to significant time loss.

3. **Tooling and Compatibility Issues**: Problems with tools like Maven plugins, debugging timeouts, and load balancers (LBs) not handling HTTP/2 well. 

4. **Network and Security**: Firewalls caused additional headaches, forcing a fallback to less optimal solutions like the Standard API.

5. **Documentation and Observability**: The documentation is described as poor, and there were difficulties in integrating meaningful error messages into observability systems.

Overall, the author wishes they had never encountered gRPC due to the extensive time and effort required to manage its complexities and limitations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experiences with different API technologies:

1. **OpenAPI vs. REST**: The author clarifies that OpenAPI is not an alternative to REST but a documentation tool for HTTP APIs. OpenAPI can describe RESTful APIs or other styles, providing a schema for tools to interpret how the API functions.

2. **gRPC and Protocol Buffers**: gRPC is highlighted as an efficient RPC mechanism using Protocol Buffers (protobufs). However, it lacks the comprehensive ecosystem and middleware support found in HTTP libraries. The author mentions that while Google's original RPC layer "stubby" wasn't open-sourced, gRPC serves as a good alternative but requires more custom development for features like logging or authentication.

3. **Challenges with gRPC**: A key issue with gRPC is its reliance on .proto files, which necessitates that clients and servers use compatible versions. This makes gRPC less flexible for debugging or spontaneous interactions compared to HTTP APIs, where one can interact with the API directly using tools like `curl`.

4. **Open Source Contribution**: The author has developed and open-sourced a Go library (`oapi-codegen`) that generates clients and servers from OpenAPI specifications, aiming to facilitate API development.

In summary, the article critiques the distinctions often made between API technologies, explains the operational differences between gRPC and HTTP APIs, and shares a personal contribution to the developer community.

## 2. [Tech takes the Pareto principle too far](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42800557)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The article discusses the differences between the game development and tech industries in terms of product development stages and completion:

1. **Vertical Slice in Game Development**: Game developers create a 'vertical slice' to demonstrate to publishers and investors how the finished game will look, feel, and play, showcasing their ability to deliver a polished product.

2. **MVP in Tech Industry**: In contrast, tech startups often present a 'Minimum Viable Product' (MVP), which is the least functional product that still has market value. This approach focuses on quickly proving a concept to attract funding, but it often does not guarantee the team's ability to complete the full product.

3. **Pareto Principle**: The article critiques the tech industry's reliance on the Pareto Principle (the idea that 20% of the effort yields 80% of the results), suggesting that while this can get products to a functional state, it often neglects the critical final stages of development necessary for a complete, polished product.

4. **Cultural Impact**: The culture of accepting and even celebrating unfinished tech products has led to a broader acceptance of products that are not fully developed. This includes game releases with day-one patches and additional content (DLC) that feels essential to the core experience.

5. **Unfinished Products**: Many tech products remain incomplete due to early market entry or because the technology or methodology might not be capable of achieving full functionality. This is particularly evident in AI applications like self-driving cars and generative AI, where current methods might not be sufficient to reach the desired end quality or functionality.

The article concludes by reflecting on historical over-optimism in AI development, suggesting that while initial breakthroughs can be impressive, the final stages of refinement are often underestimated or unattainable with current approaches.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article critiques the author's perspective on product development methodologies, particularly distinguishing between the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and Vertical Slice approaches:

1. **Purpose of MVP vs. Vertical Slice**: The critic argues that while both concepts aim at product development, their objectives differ significantly. MVP is about validating if there's a market need for a new software product (Product-Market Fit or PMF), whereas Vertical Slice focuses on ensuring the product can compete in an existing market by delivering a full-featured slice of the product.

2. **Contextual Differences**: The critic points out that video games, which often use a Vertical Slice, are competing within a known market, unlike startups which might be creating demand for something new.

3. **Validation vs. Completion**: The discussion highlights that the 80/20 rule in MVP development is about validating the product idea quickly rather than perfecting the product. The examples of Magic Leap and Humane are used to illustrate the pitfalls of spending too long on product development without market validation. These products, despite being technically advanced and fully developed, failed because they did not meet an existing market demand, showcasing the risk of not using lean methodologies to test market assumptions early on.

Overall, the critique underscores the importance of understanding the market context and the purpose behind different product development strategies, emphasizing quick validation over prolonged development when entering new or uncertain markets.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the inappropriate application of rapid development cycles, typical in non-critical software, to critical systems like medical devices, drone controls, and power plant safety systems. The author points out that:

- Critical software, such as that used in medical devices or power plants, requires a more cautious and thorough development process due to the potential risks involved.
- There's a growing trend where people mistakenly apply the fast-paced development strategies of consumer software to these critical areas, leading to potential safety and reliability issues.

## 10. [A Proper x86 Assembler in Haskell Using the Escardó-Oliva Functional](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42768614)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenge of writing an X86 assembler in Haskell, focusing on the problem of calculating the size of jump instructions which can vary between 2 and 5 bytes depending on the distance to their target labels. Here are the key points:

1. **Problem Description**: Assembling X86 instructions requires knowing the exact size of jump instructions, which isn't possible in a single pass because the size depends on the distance to the label, which can only be known after all instructions are laid out.

2. **Functional Programming Approach**: The author uses the Escardó-Oliva functional, a higher-order function from functional programming, to solve this problem. This functional computes optimal moves in a game-like scenario where each move represents choosing between a short (2 bytes) or near (5 bytes) jump encoding.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Types and Data Structures**: The article defines types like `Label`, `JIx` (Jump Index), `X86 a` (an instruction), `Enc` (encoding type), `Move` (a pair of jump index and its encoding), and others to handle the assembly process.
   - **Function `ij`**: Converts a list of `X86` instructions into a list where jumps are indexed for lookup.
   - **Game Theory Application**: The assembly process is likened to a single-player game where the goal is to minimize the total size of the code. The `optimalPlay` function uses the Escardó-Oliva functional to determine the best encodings for jumps.

4. **Outcome and Moves**: The `p` function calculates the total bytes needed based on the current moves (encodings of jumps), and `εs` provides selection functions for choosing the next move based on past moves.

5. **Label Offsets and Validation**: The `ixes` function computes the offsets of labels and jumps assuming initially all jumps are short, with the understanding that invalid configurations will be pruned later. The `valid` function checks if the current configuration of encodings is consistent with the assembly rules.

In summary, the article demonstrates an innovative use of functional programming concepts to solve a practical problem in low-level programming, specifically by using game theory and optimization techniques to manage the complexities of X86 assembly code generation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the memory efficiency of different programming approaches, specifically focusing on:

1. **Multipass Assemblers**: These are efficient in memory usage as they only require keeping a list of symbols in memory, rather than the entire program, which is beneficial even if not a major concern with today's large memory capacities.

2. **Haskell Programming**: The text hints at some drawbacks of Haskell in terms of memory usage. It mentions that while Haskell can offer concise and clear code (like a simplified version of quicksort), these implementations might not be as memory-efficient due to inherent properties like immutability and the use of linked lists, which can introduce additional O(n) complexities and constant factors in performance. This results in what might be called "not really a quicksort" when comparing to traditional implementations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the complexity of achieving what appears to be a single pass operation in programming. It suggests that even though it might look like a single pass, there's likely an underlying mechanism involving:

1. **Transitional Internal State**: There's probably some internal state that changes as the operation progresses, requiring looping or iteration over this state.

2. **Lazy Evaluation**: The process might use lazy evaluation, where computations are deferred until their results are needed, which can hide the multiple passes or iterations.

3. **State Preservation**: To manage where to jump or continue in the code, the system must keep track of the current state or "where" it is in the process, which involves preserving execution states.

4. **Completion and Return**: The operation calculates or processes data and then returns to fill in any gaps or complete the operation, implying multiple stages or passes in the background even if presented as one pass. 

In summary, the article argues that what might be described as a "one pass" operation often involves complex state management and deferred computation, essentially making it more than just one pass when considering the internal mechanics.
