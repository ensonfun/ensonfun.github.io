### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article claims that the only option for a small laptop is to buy an old UMPC on eBay, but this is incorrect as there are modern mini laptops available. The author purchased a new 8" mini laptop with a folding touchscreen and an Intel N100 CPU from AliExpress. The laptop has specifications such as 12GB RAM, NVME SSD slot, 1280x800 touchscreen with pen support, USB-C port, HDMI, Ethernet, WiFi 6, and Bluetooth 5.2. Overall, the laptop is considered decent for a Chinese device, with features like a backlit keyboard and compatibility with the Microsoft Surface pen. The 1280x800 resolution may be low by today's standards, but it is satisfactory for the 8" screen. One downside is that some modern apps may be pushed behind the taskbar due to the 800 vertical resolution on Windows 10. The cursor touchpad may not provide precise control, but the touchscreen with pen support can be used for selecting smaller items. The laptop was priced at $245 + tax during Black Friday, and it is suggested to keep an eye out for sales. The UEFI appears to be fully unlocked with various options for adjusting CPU boost and voltage settings, but the author has not been able to get the CPU to pull more than 6.5w. One drawback of purchasing from a non-established company is that the drivers for the device are emailed to the buyer as a .zip file from the seller, which can be seen as sketchy. However, this is a common practice among Aliexpress devices.

 The article mentions a chip called TH1520, which is the same SoC as the Lichee Pi 4A. It is said to be faster than JH7110 in microbenchmarks but slower in practical applications, possibly because of its smaller cache. TH1520 is also less power efficient and lacks the upstream support that JH7110 has. The article suggests looking at Pinetab-V, a tablet-laptop based on TH1520, or waiting for Milk-V Oasis, which is set to be released in June and is based on SG2380, the first announced RISC-V SoC with serious performance. The Milk-V Oasis is said to have 16x SiFive P670 and 8x X280, all RVA22 compliant, along with the vector 1.0 extension.

## 5. [Venice's Secret Service](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38998055)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses the existence of organized intelligence in Renaissance Venice during the 1500s and early 1600s. It focuses on the Council of Ten, the state security body under the Doge, and its role in maintaining secrecy and governing the city. Venice's secret service was seen as special compared to other European powers, such as Spain, due to its superior managerial practices and information flow. Secrecy was used to limit the exchange of information and govern the city, with citizens participating in reporting on and denouncing each other through anonymous tip boxes. Venice's diplomats used different ciphers for secure communication, often requiring the exchange of keys. The central department of cryptology managed and provided support for encryption and decryption. The nepotism within the department was seen as a way to pass down cryptologic talent within families. Overall, Venice demonstrated a sophisticated secret service and effective communication channels to protect its interests.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Philippe Kahn, co-founder of Borland, and his connection to Professor Niklaus Wirth, the creator of the programming language Pascal. Kahn mentions in a podcast that he chose to attend Wirth's Pascal class, which had fewer students compared to the Fortran class. He describes Wirth as an enlightened and clear thinker, making the class a great experience for him. The author speculates that Kahn's positive impressions of Wirth may have influenced Borland's decision to acquire Compass Pascal.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the limitations and exclusions in the design of the Pascal language allowed for compact implementations and widespread success. However, many successful versions of Pascal had to extend the language in order to overcome these limitations. The author mentions that they initially liked Pascal but later found themselves spending a lot of time trying to work around its limitations. In contrast, the C language eliminated the need for such workarounds and significantly increased the author's productivity. The article concludes by stating that although C compilers may have numerous extensions, plain C is still a much more useful language than the original Pascal, which is why C eventually became more popular.

## 9. [How a software glitch at the UK Post Office ruined lives](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39010070)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 A software error in the UK Post Office's IT system caused innocent sub-postmasters to be wrongfully convicted and bankrupted between 1999 and 2015. The faulty system, called Horizon, falsely showed that money had gone missing from Post Office accounts, leading to criminal charges against 700 sub-postmasters, some of whom spent time in prison. The scandal has recently gained public awareness and outrage following the broadcast of a TV drama highlighting the sub-postmasters' fight for justice. The government has pledged to pass legislation to overturn the convictions, but important questions remain unanswered, including who should be held responsible and whether Fujitsu, the company behind Horizon, should pay compensation. The Post Office has already paid over Â£138 million in compensation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on their inspiration for pursuing a PhD in information systems, driven by a desire to understand why IT incompetence persists despite advancements in knowledge and technology. They quickly discovered that this topic had already been extensively researched, leading them to conclude that people and organizations are inherently flawed. The author acknowledges that while organizational research aims to lead us towards improvement, it can sometimes feel futile when some individuals remain indifferent. Although the author is no longer focusing on this topic, they find it interesting that this particular case continues to receive media attention, along with other similar examples.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the technical failures behind the Post Office's Horizon system. One member of the development team, David McDonnell, admitted that out of the eight people on the team, only two were skilled, two were average, and the rest were incapable of producing professional code. The article emphasizes that blame should be placed on management rather than the developers who made coding errors, as they should not be held responsible for the legal consequences that resulted.

## 10. [Many AI safety orgs have tried to criminalize currently-existing open-source AI](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39009779)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concern that some AI safety organizations are advocating for bans on open-source AI models. It points out that while many AI safety organizations support open-source tools for AI safety work, there are a few well-funded organizations pushing for bans on certain types of open-source models. The article provides examples of proposed regulations by these organizations, such as defining "powerful AI systems" based on computational resources, parameter count, or benchmark performance. According to the proposals, AI systems that meet or exceed these measures would be subject to requirements that effectively ban open-sourcing them. However, the article also highlights that these organizations claim their proposals only affect a small fraction of the overall AI development ecosystem. The article concludes by mentioning the existence of lobbying organizations and their potential impact on open-source AI models.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author accuses AI safety proponents of being hypocritical because they should advocate for banning all AI if they practiced what they preached. They argue that there are AI systems causing harm, specifically in the form of obfuscating plagiarism and generating spam on the internet. The author criticizes AI safety advocates for not addressing this issue.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the end of open source AI might be nearing because once training data becomes licensed, open source AI will no longer be viable. The author expresses concern about this potential outcome and believes it is almost inevitable. They mention that many people are upset with OpenAI and other organizations for using training data without permission, and speculate that politicians may make it a platform issue and rewrite laws to prevent companies from using data freely. The author concludes that even if court cases are decided in favor of OpenAI, the issue may not be fully resolved.
