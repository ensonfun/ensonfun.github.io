### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Caesar's Entertainment may have decided to no longer host the DEF CON conference due to lower revenue from attendees. DEF CON attendees tend to gamble less and spend less on dining and drinking compared to the average Vegas conference attendee. Las Vegas has experienced a resurgence after the pandemic, suggesting that Caesar's is doing well enough to attract higher-revenue guests for their rooms even during the traditionally slow month of August. The article also mentions another conference held in August, which attracts attendees who do not gamble or spend much at the hotel. This conference chooses August to get better discounts from a lower-end hotel, which is located away from the strip and has less dining and gambling revenue potential.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author questions the choice of having DEFCON, an event, in August and in Las Vegas. They suggest alternative locations like Kodiak, Alaska and Portsmouth, Maine, as well as criticizing other hot places like Houston and New Orleans. The author wonders why anyone would think Vegas is a good idea in August.

## 2. [Deno in 2023](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39259068)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The article provides an update on the developments made by Deno in 2023. Deno expanded its capabilities by incorporating built-in Node modules, bridging the gap between Deno and the Node ecosystem. It also introduced features to facilitate a smoother transition from Node to Deno. The stabilization of the Node-API eliminated the need for the --unstable flag when utilizing npm packages dependent on Node-API. Deno.serve() function was introduced to streamline web server creation. Performance improvements were achieved through targeted optimizations in core libraries and the event loop mechanism. Deno also integrated WebGPU, allowing developers to harness GPU hardware directly with JavaScript. Deno's Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration and support for Jupyter enabled a better development experience and the ability to use JavaScript and TypeScript in data science and visualization tasks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's positive view of the Deno project and their desire for greater support in embedding Deno into a Rust host process. The author explains that they are writing a JavaScript bundler and need a Node.js runtime to execute plugins. While Deno's executable has good Node support for their use case, embedding Deno using the deno-core crate is challenging and lacking in documentation. The author suggests that Deno could become a preferred runtime for JavaScript tooling if it had better support for embedding. Currently, they are using a Node.js child process and communicating with it from the Rust host process using stdio, but this approach has higher communication latency compared to an embedded Deno runtime.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is interested in the WebGPU feature and is working on a framework called Slint, which allows for creating desktop GUIs in JavaScript/TypeScript without using a browser/webview. Currently, they use binaries through napi-rs to bring in a window using the platform native API and merge event loops. They hope that if Deno supports bringing up a window directly, they can ship web assembly (wasm) instead of native binaries for all platforms, simplifying event loop integration. However, they also need additional APIs for mouse and keyboard input, accessibility, popup windows, system tray, etc. The WebGPU feature does not include the API to launch a window, so an extra library binary is still needed.
