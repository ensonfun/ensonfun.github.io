## 2. [Mythbusters: Wing Commander I Edition](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37564217)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the famous "thank you for playing Wing Commander" story, which is a humorous anecdote about a programmer who allegedly used a clever hack to address a memory error in the game. The story has become popular online, but in recent years, it has been criticized by unhappy Star Citizen fans as evidence of selling a shoddy product. The article investigates the origin of the story and concludes that it is indeed true, but with some minor changes in later retellings. The article provides evidence from the original programmer and examines the game's code to determine how the message is displayed. Ultimately, it is confirmed that the hack was done during the development of the game and was fixed before it was shipped, making it a clever engineering trick rather than a sign of a poor-quality product.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a hack implemented by Traveller's Tales for the game Sonic 3D Blast on the Sega Genesis/Megadrive. By physically wiggling or hitting the game cartridge while the console is powered on, a secret level select screen would appear. This was originally thought to be an easter egg, but it was actually a custom crash handler created by the developers. The crash handler redirected the main CPU's error interrupts to the level select screen to avoid their game build being rejected by Sega's QA team. The reason for this was that Sega's QA testing process took weeks, and any crashes would result in the build being rejected and having to start over. The article also mentions that the linked YouTube channel, "Coding Secrets," has other videos detailing similar hacks.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on the magic of being able to connect with first-party sources and how it can sometimes seem impossible due to age or geographic distance. They mention their own experience growing up in Sweden in the 80s and being a fan of computer games, particularly "Uridium" and "Paradroid," which were well-known at the time. They express their surprise and excitement at now having the author of these games, Andrew Braybrook, in their social media feed and seeing him still involved in game development. The author acknowledges that similar connections could happen before the internet, but believes it may have been harder or more rare. They provide links to more information about the games and the author's Twitter feed.

## 3. [I digitalized Berlin's registration form](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37566992)

**Total comment counts : 53**

### Summary

 The article discusses the process of registering an address in Berlin and criticizes the inefficiencies of the current paper form. The author has created an improved web form that offers more functionality and a better user experience. The new form addresses issues such as "c/o" addresses and missing details about the location within a building. It also allows for handling multiple family members on a single form. The web form is designed to be user-friendly and adapt to the user's responses. The author describes using browser language settings to suggest the user's country and other subtle improvements. The form operates within the user's browser and does not share personal information. The author mentions potential future projects, such as creating digital versions of other forms and mailing or faxing them if needed. The article concludes by suggesting the use of QR codes or short URLs to eliminate the need for paper forms.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the flawed process of digitizing administration in Germany. It describes a system where a fixed sum is allocated for digitization, and a government project is publicly advertised. However, a bureaucrat with connections to an IT service business is awarded the contract. The project is then outsourced to a sweatshop, resulting in higher costs and delays. The final product is a cumbersome frontend that requires users to fill out a form, which is then printed and manually typed into another software by low-level clerks. The completed form must be physically signed and stamped at a local administrative office before being faxed to the next authority. The frontend is only accessible during weekdays from 8 am to 1 pm as the server is turned off outside of office hours to save energy.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses frustration with the inefficiency and long waiting times at Bürgerämter (citizen offices) in Germany, specifically in Berlin. They share their personal experience of a delayed registration and expired ID card with no available appointments. The author criticizes the mismanagement of these offices, which has been a long-standing issue, and suggests the need for a "Minister for Time" to address such problems in both the bureaucracy and medical system. They argue that waiting should be the exception, not the norm, and there should be measurable metrics and consequences for delays.

## 4. [Making IIIF Official at the Internet Archive](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37560428)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The Internet Archive is making its International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) service official, upgrading it to utilize the latest version 3.0 of the IIIF specification and expanding support to include audio, movies, and collections. The IIIF service provides various benefits such as deep zoom on high-resolution images, comparative item analysis, portability across media players, and annotation support. The Internet Archive has been running an experimental IIIF service for over seven years, and now aims to make it an officially supported service. The upgrade is a collaboration between the Internet Archive and members of the IIIF community. The IIIF service will be moved from the iiif.archivelab.org domain to iiif.archive.org, and the current service will continue to run during a grace period to allow partners to migrate. The migration will introduce a new and improved, official IIIF service, and once it is confirmed to be working well, the legacy service will be discontinued. The Internet Archive's IIIF service aims to make IIIF usage and adoption more accessible globally by lowering the barriers to using IIIF.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of models to test our understanding of past events. It states that if a model can accurately reproduce past events, it indicates an understanding of those events. However, it also warns that creating a model that coincidentally works doesn't necessarily confirm anything. The article criticizes the use of the term "confirm" when referring to models, emphasizing that models can only test hypotheses and correlations, not confirm physical facts.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 8. [Tell HN: ChatGPT cut off date now Jan 2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37564686)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article discusses various topics, including LeBron James' career points in the NBA as of January 2022, Max Verstappen winning the 2021 Formula 1 World Championship, the passing of Scottish rugby player Siobhan Cattigan in November 2021, and the absence of information regarding the passing of Claude Humphrey as of January 2022. The article also mentions the limitations of the model's knowledge cutoff date and suggests checking the latest news sources for up-to-date information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 As of January 2022, LeBron James had not reached 36,000 career points in the NBA. More recent data beyond that date is not available in the article. To get the most up-to-date information on LeBron James' career point total, it is advised to consult the latest NBA statistics or relevant websites.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that asking a model about its cutoff date is not a reliable way to determine what it has been trained on. The model does not know unless it was provided with that information during fine-tuning. Even then, it does not guarantee accuracy. Instead, it is more helpful to ask the model about events that occurred during a specific time period, as this would confirm that it has at least been exposed to recent news.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitation of simplistic rules, such as "don't be a dick," in scaling small communities. It argues that these rules are effective when a community is small and cohesive, allowing for a shared consensus on appropriate behavior. However, when a community grows larger and includes strangers, there is no shared understanding of good behavior or context to evaluate it. Therefore, simply telling people to be nice becomes ineffective in these situations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how in the 1990s, there were extensive discussions about netiquette on Usenet. However, in retrospect, these discussions are considered somewhat naive.
