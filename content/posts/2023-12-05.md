### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the use of trains in Poland by regional train companies. There are five servicing levels, with some smaller competitors winning tenders at lower prices due to the European Union Agency For Railways opening the market. The article mentions an incident where four trains serviced by SPS Mieczkowski couldn't start and resulted in penalties. Other trains from different companies also became immobilized. SPS Mieczkowski hired Dragon Sector to investigate and found routines to disable trains. The case is being investigated by the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau in Poland, but it is unlikely to harm Newag. The Office of Rail Transport of Poland has distanced itself from the case. Train purchases in Poland have a regulated tender process with limited flexibility for rail companies.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article contains links to longer write-ups that provide additional details about a situation involving hacked trains in Poland. There were suspicions for over a year that something was wrong with Newag trains after multiple faults were found in trains owned by different companies. The companies were using a third-party service company instead of servicing with Newag, and it was discovered that the service company had hired hackers to investigate the issue. It took some time for experts to reverse engineer and understand the full extent of the situation.

## 2. [I hacked Magic the Gathering: Arena for a 100% win rate](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38525978)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience of finding a vulnerability in the game Magic: The Gathering Arena that allows them to make opponents automatically concede. The author explains that card games like Magic: The Gathering are more difficult to hack compared to fast-paced shooters because they are turn-based and have less information exchange between the client and the server. The author also addresses the importance of having "bored nerds" like themselves examine the game for vulnerabilities and expresses their appreciation for the game not obfuscating its client-side code. The article concludes by mentioning that while cheating ecosystems are less prevalent in card games, bugs still exist.

 The article discusses the author's initial experience using Linux to inspect network traffic with a program called ShowEQ for the game EverQuest. The network traffic at that time was unencrypted and contained valuable information. The author used a hub to redirect traffic to their Linux box, allowing them to create a live map of the game's zone and locate the game's characters and items. This process was passive and undetectable. However, the game developers eventually encrypted the network traffic, rendering this method ineffective.

The author questions the necessity of running the bot on a server, as it may be expensive and unnecessary. They also mention that servers typically have similar processing power to local machines. The author concludes that running the bot locally may be faster and more efficient.

### Summary

 A YouTuber pilot named Trevor Daniel Jacob has been sentenced to six months in federal prison for obstructing a federal investigation. Jacob deliberately destroyed the wreckage of an airplane that he intentionally crashed in Santa Barbara County to gain online views. He pleaded guilty to one count of destruction and concealment with the intent to obstruct the investigation. Prior to the crash, Jacob mounted multiple video cameras on the airplane and equipped himself with a parachute, video camera, and selfie stick. He recorded himself parachuting to the ground and the airplane as it descended and crashed into a dry brush area. Despite initially agreeing to provide the wreckage and video recordings to investigators, Jacob lied about not knowing the location of the wreckage. He later flew with a friend by helicopter to the site, secured the wreckage, and transported it to various locations to destroy it. Jacob uploaded a YouTube video titled "I Crashed My Airplane," which contained a promotion of a wallet and depicted the crash, in an attempt to make money. The United States Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General, the National Transportation Safety Board, and the Federal Aviation Administration investigated the case.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that the question of whether a person is guilty or not is not as interesting as whether they will come out financially successful. They mention a specific video that gained millions of views and a sponsorship deal, implying that companies may be willing to break the law and pay the consequences if it benefits them financially. The author poses the question of why independent individuals wouldn't also take risks for financial gain.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a theory proposed by Professor Oppenheim and his former Ph.D. students, which suggests that the weight of a mass may fluctuate over time. A second paper, published in Nature Communications, explores the consequences of the theory and proposes an experiment to test it. The article highlights the importance of testing theories in physics, as many previous theories have been untestable.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 6. [Firefox on the brink?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38531104)

**Total comment counts : 93**

### Summary

 The article discusses how a guideline for developers of U.S. government websites, called the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS), may contribute to the decline of Mozilla's Firefox browser. The USWDS supports browsers with more than 2% usage, but Firefox's market share has been consistently declining over the years. The dominance of Chrome and the popularity of Safari on mobile devices also hinder Firefox's usage. As Firefox continues to lose web space and market share, it is likely that the USWDS will remove it from the list of supported browsers. This could have implications beyond government web developers, potentially leading to Firefox's irrelevance. The author highlights Mozilla's own user activity chart, which shows a significant drop in active Firefox clients over a five-year period.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Firefox uses Enhanced Tracking Protection, which is enabled by default and affects Google Analytics. The author argues that usage figures relying on GA may not accurately reflect the true situation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author switched to a browser with a lower market share after the Manifest v3 controversy. Despite concerns about using a less popular browser, they have not encountered any issues so far. The only missing feature is a Google Drive web app due to a Chrome-only extension. The author suggests that the ongoing standardization of the web may reduce the drawbacks of using a niche browser.

**Total comment counts : 49**

### Summary

 Genetic testing company 23andMe announced that hackers accessed the personal data of approximately 14,000 customers, including profile information about users' ancestry. However, it was later revealed that 6.9 million individuals in total were affected by the breach. The stolen data included personal information, relationship labels, DNA percentages, ancestry reports, and self-reported locations. The breach was originally disclosed in October when a hacker claimed to have stolen the DNA information of 23andMe users and attempted to sell the data. It is believed that the breach was a result of customers reusing passwords. By hacking into one individual's account, the hackers were able to access the personal data of both the account holder and their relatives, significantly increasing the number of victims.
