## 2. [TokenFlow: Consistent diffusion features for consistent video editing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36830490)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 This article introduces a framework for text-driven video editing using a text-to-image diffusion model. The goal is to generate a high-quality video that aligns with a given target text while preserving the spatial layout and dynamics of the original video. The framework achieves consistency by propagating diffusion features based on inter-frame correspondences. It does not require training or fine-tuning and can be used with any off-the-shelf text-to-image editing method. The article demonstrates state-of-the-art editing results on various real-world videos. The key finding is that temporal consistency in the edited video can be achieved by enforcing consistency in the internal diffusion features across frames during the editing process.
