### Summary

 The article describes a Neovim setup called LazyVim which is made easy to customize and extend config with the help of lazy.nvim.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author had become burnt out customizing their Vim settings, but was impressed by LazyVim. Within a minute of installing it, they had a fully functional IDE that felt comparable to VS Code with plugins. The author recommended LazyVim to those who find setups like nvChad or lunarVim overly complex.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article talks about the benefits of making personalized tools, specifically about the author's experience with creating their own scripts in computer security and customizing their vim editor using python, typescript, rust, and ruby configurations. They mention that their vim editor has become the best Python IDE for them and advise junior developers to understand what they copy and paste. The author has found new plugins and added them along the way, committing everything in case they need to use it on a new machine. They prefer using personalized tools like their vim editor rather than struggling to configure pre-existing tools like vscode.

## 2. [A Firefox-only minimap (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36757542)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The blog post reveals how to create minimaps using the "element()" CSS function, which is only supported by Firefox. The function allows you to display images of arbitrary HTML elements on your page, and it is live. The post includes code examples and references to resources for further reading on frontend development.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author built a JS library ten years ago for folding up DOM elements, and was excited for the adoption of element() and CSS custom filter spec. However, neither of these features have been widely adopted by other browsers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author feels that mini-maps, a feature found in certain editors and sites, are mostly useless for coding and equally useless for sites. The author gives three reasons for this: the detail is too small to see, the feature takes up too much screen space, and other navigation tools like indexes or search functions work better. The author believes that mini-maps could be useful for large images or maps, as they offer a visual aid to see where you are in the whole.

## 3. [Red Programming Language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36752146)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 I'm sorry, but I cannot summarize an article without having access to its content. Please provide me with the article you want me to summarize.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article shares two links to websites that contain examples of the Red programming language.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author recalls facing issues with Red programming language in the past. There were problems with the default compile mode being shared, making all executables depend on a "libred.dll" or similar. Compiling "libred" was slow taking around one minute, but after its compilation, it was skipped in the compile stage to make it faster (still with the limitation of #1). The option to compile static was available but it took one minute every time, making every single static compile, even "hello world" take one minute every time. The author posted multiple issues about this, but they were closed without much help, and moved on to other languages like Go and Rust, which didn't have this issue.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author had been losing through hole 104 capacitors quickly before realizing that a vent hole in their backyard shed, where they kept their hobby electronics workbench, was uncovered. Upon investigation, they found a bird had built a nest with pine needles and some through-hole components. The author had unknowingly blocked the bird from its nest when they fixed the vent hole. No eggs or chicks were found in the nest.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes a scenario where some elderly people refuse to have child-proof caps on their prescriptions because they do not have any children at home to open them for them.

## 5. [Commodore 64 VIC-II 6567/6569 Replacement Project](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36740368)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The VIC-II Kawari is an open source hardware replacement for the VIC-II chip found in Commodore 64 home computers. It is compatible with the original VIC-II chips but has additional features. The PCB interfaces with a real C64 address and data bus through the VIC-II socket and can replace all the functions of a real VIC-II chip. Three PCB designs/configurations are possible, ranging from $30 to $80 in terms of BOM cost. The board comes with on-board oscillators for both NTSC and PAL-B standards, but it can also be configured to use the motherboard's clock for the machine's 'native' standard via jumper config. It can be used as both an NTSC and PAL machine, but it is not recommended for C64-C short boards. The board does not have frame buffer video output and does not attempt to make digital video look like a CRT. The VIC-II Kawari is a faithful reproduction of the original chips.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The Ultimate64 is a complete C64 emulation motherboard that can be mounted into an old C64, providing modern features such as HDMI output, 1541 drive emulation, and the ability to play every C64 game ever written from a USB stick. Despite being relatively unknown, the FPGA technology used to create the Ultimate64 is impressive.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The VIC-II-Kwawari was recently reviewed by retro-YouTuber Adrian Black who stated it works well and is impressive.

## 7. [Johnson and Johnson sues researchers who linked talc to cancer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36753032)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has sued four doctors who published studies that suggested a link between talc-based personal care products and cancer. LTL Management, J&J's subsidiary that absorbed the company's talc liabilities, filed lawsuits in May and July against three researchers asking them to retract a study stating asbestos-contaminated talc products sometimes led to patients developing mesothelioma. The company alleges the studies are inaccurate, and the researchers did not disclose that their patients had been exposed to asbestos from other sources. J&J faces more than 38,000 lawsuits alleging that its talc products were contaminated by asbestos, leading to cancers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Johnson & Johnson created a subsidiary company called LTL Management and transferred all of the related liabilities to it, before filing for bankruptcy within three days. This strategy is called the "Texas two-step," which controversially allows a parent company to protect its assets by setting up a subsidiary to hold its liabilities. Critics argue that it allows companies facing litigation to evade corporate responsibility and is an abuse of the bankruptcy system. The bankruptcy filing was initially dismissed by the Third Circuit Court in Philadelphia but LTL filed for bankruptcy protection again in April with a higher settlement proposal.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article posits that the vast majority of papers in machine learning are misleading and notes issues such as misleading baselines, statistical insignificance of improvements, and overfitting to test data. They question the validity of peer-reviewed papers being used as evidence in court and suggest that there should be a higher bar for what is presented as evidence. The author believes that everyone is paying for the lawsuits through insurance, taxes, and higher drug prices.

## 8. [Show HN: Structured output from LLMs without reprompting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36750083)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes OpenAI for claiming their newly introduced product called the "OpenAI GPT-3" can be self-hosted when it's actually just a thin wrapper client making requests to a remote server. The author suggests that OpenAI's approach to introducing the product in this way doesn't foster trust in potential customers, and that they should be more upfront about the primary business model being SaaS.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the true power of LLMs being in structured output, rather than unstructured text generation. The article proposes two approaches to achieving this: LMQL or finetuning the model to understand function calls and their potentially JSON schemas. However, the article raises concerns about OpenAI's approach as it may make the GPT-4 less capable than it was before due to the forgetful nature of finetuning. The other approach is to steer the LLM's output as it generates tokens with LMQL, resulting in less token usage and 100% accuracy.

## 9. [Using XPath in 2023](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36752419)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The latest release of htmx includes the addition of event listeners to elements with hx-on. Unlike other hx- attributes that use CSS attribute selectors, hx-on has a dynamic attribute name that contains the event. XPath, a query language for extracting information from XML-like documents, has more expressive features when compared to CSS selectors but also has a higher potential for slow selectors and lacks well-defined specificity rules. Libraries that extend HTML often do so by manually finding elements, but XPath is already built into browsers and can be accessed through the document.evaluate API.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article points out that using XPath without being embedded in XSLT or something else can be difficult due to namespace bindings. Without XML, XPointer bindings would have to be used which can be complicated. The author is surprised that the htmx framework is using XML nostalgia as it requires the use of namespace bindings.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In the 2000s, the author's personal homepage used a simple XML document that was automatically translated using XSLT. This predated tools such as Firebug and DOM inspectors, meaning that when viewed in a browser, users would see only XML markup. Despite the limitation, the author continued to use the XML + XSLT + XPath combo for their projects at Microsoft.
