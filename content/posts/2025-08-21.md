## 1. [AI tooling must be disclosed for contributions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44976568)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The text emphasizes taking user feedback seriously while noting frequent loading errors. It discusses AI use in development: AI can help, but contributors should disclose AI involvement to help maintainers judge review effort; transparency is valued. The author supports AI tooling but urges responsible use and human review, even joking that a PR wasn’t AI-generated. It advocates PR templates with checklists (e.g., Developer Certificate of Origin) and proposes a standard AI byline listing tools used in commits. It also touches on tab completions and the need for clear documentation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Not an AI enthusiast, the author treats AI as just another tool and doesn’t mind how the final PR is reached. But they advise that if a maintainer asks you to “jump before submitting” a PR, you should politely ask, “how high?”—seek clarification or push back.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece argues that AI brings IP taint that many ignore. It claims that if someone said they memorized and could regurgitate all open-source code, you’d ban them from coding at a company. Yet AI is rationalized with buzzwords, effectively allowing a lax laundering of GPL and other licensed code. This, the author warns, would be existentially toxic to IP-based companies.

## 2. [Building AI products in the probabilistic era](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44976468)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 General‑purpose AI is causing a fundamental rupture in the tech industry. AI’s behavior isn’t fully predictable; models rely on probabilistic distributions rather than deterministic mappings. This challenges how we design, engineer, and grow software. Past progress sparked skepticism but yielded new playbooks; now those playbooks are becoming obsolete. The shift is likened to moving from Newtonian physics to wave functions: software will increasingly be probabilistic. Traditional software is framed as F: X→Y with reliable outcomes, driving SLOs and test‑driven design. AI demands new architectures, product management, and organizational approaches.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The speaker will only believe the theory if data show that top AI teams have more scientists than engineers, i.e., a scientists-to-engineers ratio greater than 1.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This piece decries defending chatbots with formal math as sophistry, arguing it hinges on an overblown axiom about a system’s capabilities. It concedes some questions (physics, code, math) have correct answers, but notes others (like personal relationships) do not. The author rejects treating probabilistic, emergent “unknown behaviors” as the future of computing, citing Baudrillard’s hyperreality and criticizing the move away from determinism. They insist the scientific method—a precursor to planning and engineering—remains essential.

## 3. [How does the US use water?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44971850)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 Water infrastructure receives far less attention and funding than other sectors. The Bureau of Reclamation’s budget is about $1.1B, versus roughly $46B for highway/DOE and $60B for HUD. In the US, water is abundant and inexpensive, but demand is rising, especially in the arid Southwest, with data centers increasing cooling-water use. The US uses about 322 billion gallons per day (117 trillion/year): 87% freshwater, 74% from surface sources, 26% groundwater. Consumptive vs non-consumptive use matters; thermoelectric power plants account for 41% of water use, mostly non-consumptive. Historically, once-through cooling dominated.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article challenges alarmist comparisons of datacenter water use to household consumption, arguing that water can become infeasible or uneconomic to access—even if not destroyed—so it’s effectively “used up.” It also shares a personal anecdote: the author’s monthly water bill is about 5% of their monthly electricity bill. In the American Southwest, annual water costs can be roughly 60% of electricity costs, raising questions about whether water prices are high, electricity prices are low, or water usage is high.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece notes the Bureau of Reclamation's $1.1 billion annual budget and highlights Cadillac Desert’s account of how damming US rivers shaped settlement, especially in Los Angeles. It recalls 1902–1905 schemes by Eaton, Mulholland, and allies to win Owens Valley water rights and block federal projects. Mulholland misled LA officials and Owens Valley residents about water availability—claiming only unused flows would be used while planning to exploit the full rights to the San Fernando Valley aquifer. The piece closes by referencing Mulholland Drive as a cultural icon.

## 4. [Crimes with Python's Pattern Matching (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44977189)

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 Hillel Wayne explains that __subclasshook__ in Abstract Base Classes can redefine what counts as a subclass, even for ABCs the target doesn’t know about. With Python 3.10’s pattern matching, this lets ABCs hijack matches and then destructure fields, since matching uses isinstance while destructuring depends on the object. You can prototype runtime ABCs to classify objects (for example, a Not class that matches everything not of a given type). But CPython caches subclass checks, limiting side effects. Still, you can make ABCs that accept every‑other type or prompt for per‑type behavior—dangerous dark magic for libraries, not everyday code.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece critiques Python's pattern matching for not being more general. It highlights two gaps: (1) “case foo.bar” is a value match, while “case foo” is a name capture; a “case .foo” could have meant a normal variable lookup with no ambiguity, but Python chose not to. (2) There’s no standard way to match and print the whole object; you can extract parts (e.g., “case float(m): print(m)”) but not “case MyObject(obj): print(obj)”—__match_args__ could have supported this, but it wasn’t implemented.

## 5. [DeepSeek-v3.1 Release](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44976764)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 DeepSeek-V3.1 launches the first agent-oriented release with Hybrid Inference: Think and Non-Think modes accessible via the DeepThink toggle (deepseek-chat = non-thinking, deepseek-reasoner = thinking). It enables faster reasoning, stronger tool use, and better multi-step tasks, with 128K context. New features include Anthropic API format support and Strict Function Calling in Beta, plus improved thinking efficiency for complex searches. It adds continued pretraining (840B tokens) for long context and updated tokenizer/template. Open-source weights for V3.1 Base and full V3.1 are available. Pricing updates start; discounts end Sept 5, 2025 (UTC).

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 On the terminal-bench leaderboard, the model trails GPT-5, Claude 4, and GLM-4.5, but holds up reasonably well against other open-weight models. The piece notes that benchmarks aren’t the full story, and real-world performance will determine its practical utility.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece suggests that Qwen3 235B 2507 Reasoning (which the author likes) and GPT-OSS-120B appear to lag in reasoning. It includes links to DeepSeek v3.1 reasoning and to the DeepSeek Chat v3.1 pricing page for further details.

## 6. [An interactive guide to SVG paths](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44941605)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 SVG path is powerful but notoriously tricky. It lets you draw curved shapes by chaining drawing instructions in the d attribute, like a pen tool. The post covers basics: M moves the pen to a start point; L draws straight lines. Commands are case-sensitive, with uppercase forms preferred. It mentions arc commands and Bézier curves, including the quadratic Q command, and relative vs absolute variants. It notes that path data is compact, but whitespace and commas aid readability, which gzip can negate in size. The piece aims to build intuition for developers of all levels.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recalls how SVG shines for a web adventure game with a randomly generated map. SVG can seem unnecessary until you need it, but dynamically creating SVG in response to user actions provides a clear graphical representation of the adventure. They also found lower-case relative commands especially useful for drawing arrows or space-sector shapes that can be translated later.

## 7. [Beyond sensor data: Foundation models of behavioral data from wearables](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44973375)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 arXivLabs is a framework that lets collaborators create and share new arXiv features on the site. It emphasizes openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy, and arXiv only partners with groups that uphold these values. It invites ideas for projects benefiting the arXiv community and directs readers to learn more. It also offers an operational status service with notifications via email or Slack.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Building on early wearable foundation models from 2018, Apple’s 2025 paper shifts to higher-level behavioral biomarkers derived from sensor data (e.g., HRV, resting heart rate) instead of raw signals. This time-series approach yields strong disease-detection performance: diabetes 83%, heart failure 90%, sleep apnea 85%.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Results were surprisingly weak: a foundation model trained on sensor data and behavioral biomarkers underperformed the baseline predictor that used only generic demographic data in almost ten areas. Even when the wearable model performed better, gains were marginal. The author expected much more dramatic improvements from such rich data.

## 8. [A Decoder Ring for AI Job Titles](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44976929)

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 AI job titles are a moving target as the field evolves; most titles are formed by mixing modifiers, domains, and roles. The post highlights a 'mix-and-match' pattern with terms like AI, ML, and Gen AI; Gen AI emerged after ChatGPT, but its usefulness wanes as LLMs are used beyond generation. The word 'researcher' (often 'scientist') is used inconsistently, causing confusion as roles shift from exploratory research to product development. Examples include OpenAI's Research Scientist and Google's Senior Applied AI Engineer, illustrating titles blended in the author’s cheat sheet.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece describes an “AI Engineer” who isn’t a researcher or GPU-focused but a regular software engineer integrating AI into products. With a math/ML background, explanations may be hand-wavy; they follow standard SDLC and wear a PM hat, while staying close to frontier model releases and using AI to write code. They question whether the title is truly special—arguing AI Engineering may be integrated product work, yet the role hinges on industry shifts without a standard playbook. They chose a product-first path over deeper GPU/MLOps work and enjoy the creative opportunities.

## 9. [Miles from the ocean, there's diving beneath the streets of Budapest](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44942627)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 Under Budapest’s streets, Molnár János Cave hides a warm, underwater world connected to the Lukács Baths. Accessed via a discreet Rose Hill entrance, the cave runs about 3.6 miles (5.8 km) and drops ~300 feet. Surface water is 27°C, cooling to 17–18°C deeper. It offers spacious, relatively easy chambers for certified cave divers, but pristine visibility depends on strict no-silt rules. The mineral-streaked walls host crystals and fossils from the ancient Pannonian Sea. The system is not fully explored; new passages are regularly discovered and mapped by volunteers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Although wary of cave diving due to safety risks, the speaker is drawn to this particular dive. The controlled environment, warm water, and guiding lines make it feel like one of the safest cave dives.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The narrator recalls their father, once a technical cave diver, and inland sites like the Dubnik opal mines near Budapest. They’re proud, but glad he’s stopped diving. The piece notes that panic or an accident in a cave can stir up mud and loosen the guideline, a brief moment that endangers everyone on the expedition.

## 10. [Weaponizing image scaling against production AI systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44971845)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Researchers demonstrate a multi-modal prompt injection that exploits image downscaling in AI systems. By embedding covert prompt content in high-resolution images that are downscaled before model inputs, attackers can trigger actions or data exfiltration in systems like Google Gemini CLI, Vertex AI Studio, and other interfaces, often without visible signs to users. The vulnerability stems from how downscaling algorithms (nearest neighbor, bilinear, bicubic) and library implementations reshape images, revealing hidden prompts. The authors fingerprint these algorithms, provide a test suite, discuss mitigations, and offer Anamorpher, an open-source tool to study such images.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author was initially puzzled about how prompt injection was achieved—wondering if it altered image data or caused a side effect. They eventually realized the method literally hides rendered text within the image itself.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The problem arises when permissions are loose, though the trend is toward more agentic systems that require such permissions. For example, a humanoid robot that fetches packages uses vision to identify targets; if a package bears an image with a prompt injection, the robot could be tricked into grabbing valuables and discarding them. The post warns that securing these systems against prompt injections is an urgent priority.
