## 1. [Firmware update hides a device’s Bluetooth fingerprint](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40958946)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 Researchers at the University of California San Diego have developed a firmware update that can hide a smartphone's unique Bluetooth fingerprint. The vulnerability caused by Bluetooth fingerprints was discovered by the team, who presented the fix at a conference two years later. The method uses layers of randomization to mask the device's transmissions, making it difficult to track. Tests showed that an adversary would need to continuously observe a device for over 10 days to achieve the same level of tracking accuracy as they could achieve within a minute without the update. The researchers are now seeking industry partners to incorporate the technology into chipsets.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the current method of detection is effective until chipset manufacturers embrace the randomization technique.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a paper that highlights an attack vector on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. The paper explains how BLE devices transmit beacons, but for privacy reasons, their MAC addresses are randomized. However, attackers can analyze the beacons for imperfections in the RF signal and obtain a device's fingerprint through frequency offsets, drift, and IQ imbalance. The article suggests that a firmware change could potentially reduce this attack vector and make tracking more difficult by introducing further randomization in chipset parameters. However, certain aspects of fingerprinting may still be observable, albeit harder to track. The author also mentions that implementing intelligent limits on beacon usage, such as only enabling them when unlocked or in motion, could enhance privacy. Overall, the article concludes that a firmware update could improve privacy in this context.

## 2. [No reasonable expectation of privacy in one's Google location data](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40958458)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the lack of privacy in one's Google location data. Users must take specific steps to enable location sharing and opt into the Location History setting. Users have control over their location data and can review, edit, or delete information obtained by Google. Google constantly monitors a user's location through GPS, and the accuracy of the estimate is represented by a confidence interval. All Location History data is stored in a repository called the Sensorvault, which is used to assist applications like Google Maps. Google has seen a significant increase in geofence warrant requests from law enforcement to access location information. Google has developed a procedure to respond to these requests, which involves disclosing anonymous lists of users within a geofence, reviewing the request, and potentially providing additional location coordinates.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Google has made a change in its policy regarding location data. It will now push location data directly to devices, rather than storing it on servers. As a result, Google will no longer provide information to law enforcement through geofence warrants that request data on all devices near a specific incident. This update aims to enhance user privacy.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is stating that not everyone with a long-standing Google account had actively opted in for location tracking. Google did not disable tracking for those who had previously tacitly consented, nor did they require them to opt in, which may have happened in the early 2010s.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The Dune RTS game is seen as significant for the real-time strategy (RTS) genre because it introduced the concept of having peasants harvest resources that players need to protect. This idea was heavily influenced by the book. Without this influence, the RTS genre may have taken a different direction, potentially making the game unrecognizable. For example, resources may have been obtained by harvesting a player's base resources, resulting in opponents attacking buildings instead. Additionally, there may have been different bonuses for map control, rather than just improved access to resources.

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the process of setting up an x86_64 CPU from a boot sector loaded by the BIOS in 16-bit real mode to 64-bit long mode. The author provides instructions and resources needed for this setup, including the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual and an assembler. The article also explains the concept of real mode and the role of the BIOS in loading the boot sector into memory. The author then discusses splitting the bootloader into two stages and transitioning from real mode to protected mode. The article concludes by mentioning the switch from real mode to protected mode and the use of segmentation for memory protection.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that it is possible to switch to long mode directly without going into protected mode first. This can be done with significantly less code. The author mentions having a bootloader for a small 64-bit kernel based on this method, which fit comfortably into the boot sector. The bootloader was able to load the kernel from disk and set up VESA modes without requiring a stage 2. The article provides a link to further information on how to enter long mode directly.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the evolution of CPU registers in x86 processors. It mentions that the 80286 had a 16-bit register called Machine Status Word (MSW), which was expanded to a 32-bit register called CR0 in the 80386 processor. The introduction of 64-bit long mode added the EFER MSR and expanded CR0 to 64 bits. However, the article notes that only 11 bits of CR0 are currently in use and EFER has 8 active bits. The author wonders why Intel/AMD did not utilize the unused bits in the existing register instead of creating new registers.
