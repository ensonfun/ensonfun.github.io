### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the complexities of using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control loops in the context of system or plant behavior. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the poles-zeros of the control loop and their interplay with the system. They argue that simplistic views of PID control, such as assuming the integrator removes long-term error or differentiation improves response time, can lead to puzzling results if the poles-zeros are not taken into account. The author suggests that having a model of the plant is crucial for effectively using PID or other control loops, but acknowledges that many people don't have this model, making it difficult to auto-tune the control loop. They suggest examining the step-response as a way to gain insights into the behavior of the plant.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that while PID control is an effective approach, there have been significant advancements in control theory and optimization techniques. It recommends exploring alternatives such as Model Predictive Control, Dynamic Matrix Control, Adaptive Control, or Linear Quadratic Regulator. These newer methods offer improved performance and more flexibility.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a recent development involving Mistral and OpenAI in the field of AI. It mentions the possibility of Mistral having an exclusivity deal similar to OpenAI for its closed models, which would make them two of the biggest players in AI apart from Google. The article also notes that it was expected for Mistral to release their newer models as closed source, as there was no clear revenue stream from their open models. The author expresses confusion about Mistral's decision to not allow finetuning of their models, which could be a way to compete with OpenAI, particularly its weak gpt-3.5-turbo. The author suggests that by allowing finetuning, Mistral could potentially achieve better performance than even GPT-4 in a wide range of tasks.

## 5. [FDA approves first medication to reduce allergic reactions to multiple foods](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39507230)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Xolair (omalizumab) injection for the reduction of allergic reactions in certain adults and children with immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergies. Xolair is intended to reduce the risk of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to food allergens. However, it is not approved for the immediate emergency treatment of allergic reactions. Xolair is the first FDA-approved medication to reduce allergic reactions to multiple types of food after accidental exposure. The drug works by binding to immunoglobulin E (IgE), the antibody that triggers allergic reactions, and blocking its receptors. The safety and efficacy of Xolair were established in a study of pediatric and adult subjects with peanut and other food allergies. Common side effects of Xolair include injection site reactions and fever.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a treatment option for food allergies that lasts 16 to 20 weeks and reduces the risk of anaphylaxis from accidental exposure to allergens. Unlike another drug used for peanut allergies, this treatment can address multiple food allergies. It highlights the appeal of this treatment for individuals with severe food allergies who want a more normal life, as it reduces reliance on the reliability of staff at food establishments. While the cause of allergies is not fully understood, this treatment provides value to those who endure it by allowing them to go out with friends without the fear of life-threatening health events.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential use of Xolair and Dupixent in making oral immunotherapy (OIT) safer and more effective for food allergies. Xolair is able to reduce reactions but does not enable individuals to eat normal serving sizes of their allergens. Additionally, Xolair requires a twice monthly injection. On the other hand, oral immunotherapy can allow individuals to consume normal serving sizes of allergens. However, initial study results combining Xolair or Dupixent with OIT have not been promising. Nevertheless, Dupixent is approved to treat EoE, a possible side effect of OIT.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the complexity of building a billing system and the reasons why it can be challenging. It mentions that departments such as finance, accounting, product, engineering, and legal are all impacted, making it a high cognitive load for the team working on it. Additionally, it lists various use cases and edge cases that need to be considered, such as time zones, pro-rations, entitlement versus billing, and usage-based models. The article also highlights the need for the billing system to integrate with other components of a quote-to-cash platform. The author advises against building a billing system unless the team has sufficient knowledge and motivation to do so.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author argues against the idea of building a billing system from scratch. They suggest that instead of reinventing the wheel, it would be more efficient to gather existing knowledge from various billing systems and consolidate it in one place. The author acknowledges the complexity of billing systems and recognizes that different businesses have specific needs. However, they believe that having a centralized collection of knowledge, approaches, paradigms, and best practices would be beneficial. They also mention that there may be cases where existing billing solutions like Stripe won't work, such as in countries like Venezuela where alternative payment gateways are required. The author draws a parallel between building a billing system and the topic of creating a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system, stating that while it may be tempting for an IT Security department to build their own, it is not recommended.

## 8. [How to find the AWS account ID of any S3 bucket](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39512896)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 The article discusses a technique for finding the AWS Account ID of any S3 bucket, whether private or public. The technique builds upon a previously published method by Ben Bridts. It involves using a VPC Endpoint for S3 and analyzing the behavior of CloudTrail when a request is denied by a VPC Endpoint policy. By creating a VPC in the same region as the target bucket and applying a policy to the VPC Endpoint, one can incrementally discover the Account ID of the bucket. The process involves making requests to the bucket and checking if they appear in CloudTrail logs, which indicates whether the VPC Endpoint policy allowed or blocked the request. Based on this information, the VPC Endpoint policy can be modified to iterate and find more digits of the Account ID.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the ability to apply a wildcard match on the s3:ResourceAccount condition key. The author believes that this feature can lead to problems as there is no legitimate reason to grant or deny permission based on a partial account id match.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of knowing and sharing an AWS account ID for conducting business tasks. The author shares an example of their experience where they needed to integrate with a third party but were unable to due to the organization's refusal to reveal their account ID for security reasons. To work around this, the author's team whitelisted a range of public IPs for inbound port access. The moral of the story is that while it may seem clever to obscure account IDs, it is essential for business purposes to have a way to connect and communicate with others.

## 9. [Frugly vs. Freemium](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39492618)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The author of the article built an education tool and faced an ethical dilemma: whether to make it free for all users or charge for it. Their solution was to make the user interface ugly for non-paying users while keeping it aesthetically pleasing for paying customers. The author discusses the pay-to-play nature of education in the US and the options for making educational tools accessible without compromising profitability. They reject the idea of relying on ads or donations and instead propose a model similar to the pricing strategy used in video games, where players can purchase cosmetic upgrades that do not affect the competitive balance. The author refers to this pricing strategy as "frugly pricing" or "cosmetic crippleware." They believe that ethics and profits don't have to conflict and that careful consideration of constraints and design thinking can create a better world.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses the idea that ethics and profits do not have to be in conflict. They emphasize the importance of carefully considering constraints and using design thinking to create a better world. The author mentions that they hope the author of the article can find a way to monetize their project without resorting to unethical practices. However, the moral of the story is uncertain as it depends on whether or not their plan is successful.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a strategy called "frugly pricing" or "cosmetic crippleware" where the word "free" is used to attract consumers to a product, but they are then required to pay for a license. The author mentions that they are good at making things uglier and that the focus is on aesthetic downgrades rather than upgrades. However, the article points out that the only difference seems to be the presence of messages, which the author compares to nagware rather than truly cosmetic changes to the user interface.

## 10. [Slimming Down Windows 3.1/3.11 (2002)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39489748)

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article recounts a project where the goal was to upgrade workstations while saving money. The solution involved using a powerful Citrix server with older 486 desktop machines running the RDP client on Windows 3.11. To simplify deployment, network booting was used and Windows was run from a RAM disk. Despite the machines only having 8MB of memory (with 4MB required by Windows), it was possible to fit everything into a 4MB RAM disk. The challenge was to find space for multiple printer drivers for different HP printers. The author developed a small program to scan the BIOS memory area to detect the connected printer and copy the appropriate driver. The project was successfully rolled out to thousands of users across several hundred locations without any problems.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In 1995, the author managed to condense Windows 3.1 onto one floppy disk in order to use it for word processing on a library catalogue computer. They used a software called "2MF 3.0" to format the disk to the highest density, created a ramdisk through autoexec.bat, and extracted WIN.UC2. Now, many years later, the author is happy to be working in IT at the same university. They also created similar floppy setups for booting CIV1, reading the complete Bible, and listening to mod's, emphasizing the simplicity of single tasking computing.
