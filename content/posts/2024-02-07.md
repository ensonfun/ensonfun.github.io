## 6. [“Wherever you get your podcasts” is a radical statement](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39287163)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 The article discusses the significance of podcasting as an open, empowering technology that is not controlled by any single company. Unlike platforms like YouTube and Tiktok, podcasting allows creators to have ownership over their work and their relationship with their audience. The article emphasizes that podcasting is based on open systems that can be interoperable with other tools and can be moved to new hosts without losing subscribers. This portability and the inability to conduct surveillance-based advertising sets podcasting apart from other online media formats. The article argues that the open format of podcasting promotes a healthier and more vibrant media ecosystem. It concludes by stating that podcasting demonstrates that an open web can still thrive and inspire new open systems to grow.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the role of Apple in the podcast industry. It highlights the fact that Apple's podcast directory, which forms the foundation of the entire podcast ecosystem, has been freely hosted and accessible to everyone. This is surprising considering Apple's tendency to prioritize monetization, as seen in their App Store. The author speculates that perhaps someone within Apple has a commitment to keeping the podcast directory open, or that the podcast industry is too small for Apple to see the value in monetizing it. The article also mentions that Spotify has now become the biggest podcast platform, but the author is relieved that they don't have complete control over monetizing podcasts because Apple serves as a counterbalance.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses a pessimistic view of the future of the RSS-based distribution system for podcasts. They attribute the continued existence of this system to decisions made by Apple many years ago. However, with Apple's introduction of Podcast Subscriptions, there is a likelihood that they will move towards gaining more control. Spotify's entry into the market involved paying for exclusive content, but for most podcasters, the interaction remained the same as with Apple – submitting the RSS feed. Spotify's acquisition of hosting platforms Anchor and Megaphone further blurs the line. Google's recent retirement of Google Podcasts in favor of YouTube Music represents a significant departure from the RSS-based method, as podcasters now upload their files directly to YouTube. The author notes that the above-mentioned platforms make up the majority of the podcast user base, so if they make changes to reduce openness, podcast creators would have to follow suit. This suggests that the perceived openness of podcasts may be more of an illusion or act of charity in 2023.

It mentions that Nvidia documents the "front-end" of their GPUs well, but details are often unclear. AMD is somewhat easier to understand due to their publication of the ISA, but mapping marketing claims to hardware can still be difficult. The article also notes that Apple GPUs are well-documented and streamlined compared to other vendors.

## 9. [Implementing system-versioned tables in Postgres](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39285752)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The author of the article expresses a desire for system-versioned tables in Postgres and SQLite. Despite extensive discussions and efforts in the Postgres community, no progress has been made in implementing this feature. Although there are extensions available, they are not supported in managed Postgres instances on platforms like Azure or AWS. The author outlines their own implementation of version-controlled tables using two tables for each table that requires versioning: a snapshot table for the current state and a history table. The history table includes columns for a history ID, system time, and the snapshot table's fields. Triggers for insert, update, and delete operations are set up to manage data changes. The author provides code examples and suggests using their GitHub repository for more information and practical use cases.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the absence of versioning support for managed Postgres instances on cloud platforms like Azure and AWS. It highlights that although there are extensions available for versioning, these are not supported in this context. As a result, users are required to create their own versioning system. The author expresses frustration over the reliance on cloud providers for infrastructure and the loss of control over tooling. They believe that users have been convinced to prioritize simplicity at a high cost, and admit to not being capable enough to handle their own tools. The author acknowledges the complexity of the issue but voices their sadness about it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author has implemented versioning in a content management system (CMS) and has read various articles on the topic. They conclude that the definition of a version can vary greatly between applications. In their CMS, they decided that versions would represent committed modifications, allowing multiple changes to a chapter before publishing. They use browser storage for undo functionality. The author emphasizes that the structure of what should or should not be versioned is a significant consideration. They argue that a useful version system is closely tied to the business logic and is more than just a snapshot.
