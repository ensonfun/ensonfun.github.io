It explores the theme of power, especially public power to construct infrastructure such as interstates and bridges.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The researchers in the article did not analyze the What3Words (W3W) technology directly due to violating the terms of service, so they created their own word list instead.

Additionally, the researchers did not have access to the actual list and had to reverse-engineer the app, which explains their use of a synthetic list.

 Lyft recently removed the ability to book rides through its website, instead requiring users to use the app on a mobile phone.
