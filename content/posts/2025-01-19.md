## 1. [TikTok goes dark in the US](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42753396)

**Total comment counts : 206**

### Summary

 **Summary:**

A new federal law in the U.S. led to TikTok being temporarily unavailable on Saturday night, with the app disappearing from app stores and displaying a message about the ban. However, by Sunday midday, TikTok began restoring service. The law, which requires TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell the app or face a ban due to national security concerns, was passed with bipartisan support and signed by President Joe Biden. Despite this, President-elect Donald Trump, who previously attempted to force a sale, has indicated he might extend a 90-day reprieve for TikTok and is considering negotiations that could involve a joint venture or sale. The situation has spurred interest from potential buyers and has also boosted alternative apps like RedNote and Lemon8, though Lemon8, also owned by ByteDance, faces similar restrictions. The Biden administration has passed the responsibility of dealing with the ban's enforcement to the incoming Trump administration.

## 2. [How Unix spell ran in 64kb RAM](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42752604)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Douglas McIlroy tackled the challenge of fitting a 250kB dictionary into the 64kB RAM of the PDP-11 computer while developing the Unix spell checker in the 1970s. Here are the key points:

- **Historical Context**: Initially developed by Steve Johnson in 1975 as a quick prototype, the Unix spell checker was simple but not very accurate or efficient, involving disk-based lookups.

- **Innovative Solutions**:
  - **Affix Removal Algorithm**: McIlroy implemented a linguistics-based algorithm to reduce words to their stems, thereby reducing the dictionary size to 25,000 words and improving accuracy.
  - **Bloom Filter**: Early on, McIlroy used a Bloom filter for fast lookups, which Dennis Ritchie helped implement. This was tuned to minimize false positives, allowing for quicker checks without actual dictionary lookups.
  - **Hash Compression**: As the dictionary grew, McIlroy switched to using hash codes. He found that storing differences between sorted hash codes, which followed a geometric distribution, could be compressed efficiently using Golomb coding. This method achieved a compression very close to the theoretical limit.

- **Performance Enhancements**: McIlroy partitioned the compressed data to enhance lookup speeds, slightly increasing memory usage but significantly improving performance.

- **Legacy**: The techniques used by McIlroy not only solved the immediate problem but also demonstrated exceptional engineering under severe constraints, influencing future data structure and compression strategies.

The article also mentions that the full details, including the mathematical and logical explanations, are provided for those interested in the in-depth technical aspects. The author encourages support through subscriptions or donations, highlighting the effort put into researching and writing the piece.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the origins and development of the Bloom filter, which was originally referred to as a "superimposed code scheme" by Douglas in his paper. Here are the key points:

- **Bloom Filter Origin**: Initially named differently, it's a type of superimposed code.
- **Historical Context**: Calvin Mooers developed a version called random superimposed coding in the 1940s, influenced by Shannon's work.
- **Literature**: Bourne's 1963 book "Methods of Information Handling" provides mathematical details on this coding technique.
- **Recognition**: By 1975, superimposed coding was recognized as an old technique, suggesting its long-standing presence in information handling. 

The term "random" in Mooers' work highlights its significance compared to earlier, less mathematically and practically important superimposed codes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an innovative method for creating a spell checker that uses minimal RAM. Here are the key points:

- **Methodology**: The spell checker first sorts the words in a document, then removes unique words by sorting. It then merges this list with a sorted dictionary, identifying only the words not found in the dictionary, which are potential misspellings.

- **Historical Context**: This technique was initially presented in BASIC in the magazine *Creative Computing* and was implemented on a TRS-80 Color Computer with less than 32k of RAM. The author was impressed by this approach when he first encountered it.

- **Turbo Lightning**: The article also references "Turbo Lightning," a software with a compressed dictionary small enough to fit within the memory constraints of early PCs. This software could perform spell checking in real-time as one typed, despite the 640k memory limit of PCs at the time, which was not fully utilized to avoid performance issues.

The article highlights the ingenuity of software solutions tailored for hardware limitations of the past, showcasing how developers maximized functionality with minimal resources.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the split of Forgejo from Gitea, highlighting the financial and ethical issues within the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community:

1. **Financial Struggles**: Gitea, despite being a popular FOSS project, struggled financially. The maintainers tried various methods like bounties, donations, and grants, but found that while some individuals and corporations were generous, others, particularly large corporations, were using Gitea for their core products without contributing back.

2. **Corporate Exploitation**: There's a mention of wealthy corporations taking advantage of the permissive MIT license, which allows for such use without mandatory contributions back to the project.

3. **Community Reaction**: When Gitea's creators formed a company to possibly manage the project more effectively, the community reacted negatively. The contention wasn't about forming a company per se, but rather about the company holding the domain and trademark, which some community members saw as problematic.

4. **Broader FOSS Issues**: The text reflects on the broader issues in FOSS where developers often go uncompensated unless they work for big tech companies, while these companies benefit immensely from FOSS projects. This scenario is described as a form of "corporate welfare" where the richest companies profit from the work of uncompensated developers.

5. **Conclusion**: The article suggests that this situation represents another example of FOSS sustainability issues, where only hobbyists or large corporations like FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) can thrive, leaving many maintainers and smaller contributors at a disadvantage.

## 4. [Haskell: A Great Procedural Language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42754098)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Haskell manages effectful computations, particularly focusing on how side effects are handled in the language:

1. **Side Effects as First-Class Values**: In Haskell, side effects like random number generation are not executed immediately when a function is called. Instead, these functions return objects that describe how to perform these side effects, which can be stored in variables or data structures without triggering the effects.

2. **Delayed Execution**: When you create lists or other data structures containing calls to functions like `randomRIO`, no actual computation occurs until these side effects are explicitly executed. This is surprising for programmers used to languages where side effects happen immediately upon function call.

3. **Execution of Side Effects**: To actually perform these side effects, Haskell uses constructs like `do` blocks with the `<-` operator. This operator "executes" the side effect object and captures the resulting value. The `do` block isn't magical; it essentially sequences operations, allowing for the execution of side effects in a controlled manner.

4. **Monads and Promises**: The concept is likened to JavaScript promises, where operations are deferred until a later time. Haskell's approach with monads provides a similar mechanism, allowing for the composition of side effects.

5. **Simplified Teaching**: The article mentions using simplified type signatures (`IO a` and `[a]`) to make the explanation more accessible to those not familiar with Haskell's full type system. This simplification helps in understanding the core concepts without getting bogged down in type theory.

6. **Understanding `do` Blocks**: The author clarifies that `do` blocks can be understood through two basic operators (`>>=` and `*>`), which combine side effects, making it clear that there's no magic in Haskell's handling of side effects.

Overall, the article aims to demystify Haskell's unique approach to side effects by explaining how these effects are treated as first-class citizens, delayed until needed, and executed in a controlled environment, contrasting with imperative programming paradigms.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the complexities of Haskell's type system and syntax, particularly focusing on operators like `*>`, `<*>`, and `<*`. The author expresses a humorous skepticism towards the claim that Haskell simplifies programming by eliminating concerns over execution order of side effects, noting personal struggles with Haskell's type system. Despite this, the article is praised for its attempt to demystify some of Haskell's more esoteric features for newcomers. The author also mentions the steep learning curve associated with Haskell, highlighting the need for frequent revisiting of basic concepts like `>>=` versus `>>` due to the lack of regular discussion with others, which might otherwise help in reinforcing these concepts.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a talk given by the author on how Haskell, a functional programming language, enhances imperative programming. Key points include:

- **Haskell's advantages**: The talk highlights how Haskell's features like first-class effects and predefined patterns for composing them eliminate much of the boilerplate code typically found in imperative programming.
- **Efficiency and Safety**: With Haskell, programmers can produce code that is both fast to write and relatively free of bugs, thanks to its type safety features. 

The author provides a link to the full presentation for those interested in a deeper exploration of the topic.

## 5. [Australian Open resorts to animated caricatures to bypass broadcast restrictions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42719498)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The Australian Open has introduced a novel broadcasting workaround for international viewers due to contractual limitations on its broadcast rights. Instead of live footage, the event streams select matches on YouTube using cartoon avatars of the players, which avoids issues with overseas broadcast rights by being both delayed and presented in an animated format. This "Wii Tennis-like" version of the matches includes real commentary and environmental sounds but features a two-minute delay. This approach was first used in the 2024 Australian Open, with increased interest noted this year. Tennis Australia, through its venture capital fund AO Ventures, has been exploring innovative technologies, although some ventures like NFTs have not been successful. The initiative aims to refresh and gamify tennis coverage, potentially impacting how sports broadcasting rights are managed in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses several concerns and suggestions related to the management of metadata in a project management or issue tracking system:

1. **Metadata Types**: Labels are repository-specific and can have multiple values, whereas issue types are organization-wide but limited to a single value per issue. Project fields offer more richness but lack multi-value options and are awkwardly placed in the API, making them hard to access directly from an issue.

2. **Integration and Flexibility**: There's a noted lack of "issue types" for Pull Requests (PRs), forcing users to use labels for metadata consistency between PRs and issues. The author suggests that implementing types as namespaces for labels could enhance flexibility, particularly if these namespaces could apply at either organization or repository levels.

3. **Workflow Management**: The article points out the absence of support for defining allowed state transitions in workflows, which is crucial for managing project stages like QA.

4. **Overall Critique**: While acknowledging improvements like better search and new relationship types, the author feels the system's metadata model lacks unity. There's a call for a more integrated approach to how metadata (labels, types, fields) interacts and is managed across different entities within the system.

The attention to these areas is appreciated, but there's a strong suggestion for a more cohesive metadata strategy to streamline project management processes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's frustration with GitHub's notification system:

1. **Overwhelming Notifications**: The author has been overwhelmed by an excessive number of notifications, especially from bots commenting on pull requests (PRs), which has led to an "infinite" stream of emails.

2. **Codeowner Role**: Being a codeowner in a large repository exacerbates the issue, as it results in an absurd number of daily notifications with no option to disable them.

3. **Notification Management**: The author has given up on using GitHub's notification screen due to its ineffectiveness and instead relies on direct messages from colleagues to be informed about PRs.

4. **Call for Improvement**: There's a strong plea for GitHub to improve its notification system to better manage or filter these notifications.

## 9. [WASM GC isn't ready for realtime graphics](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750781)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 **Summary of the Article on Wasm GC:**

The article discusses WebAssembly's (Wasm) Garbage Collection (GC), which has been implemented across all major web browsers. Wasm GC allows managed memory languages to leverage the browser's garbage collectors, reducing the need for including a GC within the Wasm binary, which results in smaller binaries, improved performance, and better integration with the host runtime.

However, the author highlights significant drawbacks when using Wasm GC for applications requiring high-performance binary data manipulation, like real-time graphics programming:

1. **Opaque Heap Objects:** Wasm GC objects are not directly accessible from JavaScript and vice versa, leading to performance issues when transferring data between Wasm and JavaScript environments. This necessitates copying data byte-by-byte, which is inefficient.

2. **Performance Comparison with Linear Memory:** 
   - **Linear Memory:** Allows direct access from JavaScript via ArrayBuffer, making operations like fetching vertex data for WebGL straightforward and efficient.
   - **Wasm GC:** Requires multiple operations for reading or writing multi-byte data, significantly slowing down performance. For instance, accessing a 32-bit integer involves fetching and combining individual bytes.

3. **Workarounds and Their Limitations:**
   - Crossing the Wasm-JS boundary for each byte operation slows down performance.
   - Implementing a memory management system within Wasm to handle bytevectors would introduce memory fragmentation issues.
   - Copying data from Wasm GC arrays to linear memory within Wasm reduces throughput.

The article concludes that while Wasm GC offers security benefits, its current implementation isn't suitable for applications demanding high binary data manipulation efficiency, like real-time graphics. The author expresses hope for future improvements to place Wasm GC on par with linear memory in such scenarios.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of WebGL and WebGPU compared to their native API counterparts. It highlights that:

1. **WebGL and WebGPU** are not as powerful or efficient for high-end graphics applications, with their primary uses being in shadertoy demos and product visualization on e-commerce sites.

2. **Tooling and Sandboxing**: These technologies are constrained by the browser's security model which includes sandboxing, leading to less control over GPU selection and rendering decisions.

3. **Blackboxing and Software Rendering**: Browsers often obscure the reasons for GPU selection or when they switch to software rendering, which can degrade performance and user experience.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of Native Client (NaCl) and Portable Native Client (PNaCl), which aimed to execute arbitrary code safely and nearly as fast as native applications within web browsers. The author enjoyed playing the game Bastion in the browser, highlighting the potential of this technology. However, limitations such as poor integration with JavaScript, the necessity of a plugin to run the code, and lack of support beyond Google Chrome, led to the downfall of NaCl and PNaCl.

## 10. [Rust: Investigating an Out of Memory Error](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42708904)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 **Summary:**

The article details an issue encountered at Qovery with their `engine-gateway` service, which unexpectedly crashed due to an out-of-memory (OOM) error despite having a stable memory usage previously. Initially, the service, which handles client connections and data transmission, ran smoothly with a memory footprint under 50MiB. The crashes were due to memory spikes that occurred too quickly for their monitoring systems to detect, leading to abrupt restarts.

- **First Incident**: The service was restarted due to OOM, but there were no visible signs of memory leaks or spikes in their monitoring, which only checked every 10 seconds. They increased the memory limit to capture the issue live next time.

- **Second Incident**: Despite the increased memory limit, all instances crashed simultaneously, causing an outage. This time, they switched from the default `libc` memory allocator to `jemalloc` to gain better insights into memory allocation.

- **Resolution**: Using `jemalloc` with `rust-jemalloc-pprof`, they profiled the memory usage and found that the `anyhow` library was capturing backtraces for every error, which significantly increased memory usage. The problem was exacerbated when errors were logged in debug format, leading to symbol resolution and memory bloat. The solution was to set environment variables `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` and `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE=0` to limit backtrace capture to only when needed, thereby preventing unnecessary memory usage.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a critique of an analysis regarding memory consumption in Rust's backtrace printing:

1. **Incomplete Analysis**: The critique points out that the analysis lacks depth in exploring why the memory usage is high. It does not differentiate between different types of memory usage such as persistent cache, temporary working memory, or potential memory leaks.

2. **Lack of Similar Reports**: The author notes that there are no widespread reports of similar memory issues with Rust backtrace printing, suggesting this might not be typical behavior.

3. **Environmental or Use-Case Specificity**: There's speculation about whether the high memory consumption could be due to something unique in the environment or specific use case of the system in question.

4. **Consistency with Panic Backtraces**: The author questions why the same out-of-memory (OOM) issues aren't observed when printing panic backtraces if backtrace printing is indeed the problem, and why only library backtraces were disabled instead of all backtraces.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an issue with the `anyhow` crate in Rust where printing an error in debug format generates a full backtrace, which consumes a large amount of memory, potentially leading to an Out of Memory (OOM) error even on systems with 4 GB of RAM. The text raises questions about why backtrace creation requires so much memory and whether there might be a memory leak involved.
