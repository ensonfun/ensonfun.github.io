### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their love for the programming language awk and how they use it frequently. They highlight one specific use case where awk is helpful for matching lines with specific conditions, particularly when a line is preceded by another line. They provide an example of using awk to create a linter for checking migration files. The author explains that since SQL statements can be spread across multiple lines, it was difficult to write a direct match, but awk's ability to track state across multiple lines helped them achieve the desired result. They have been using this approach successfully for about a year.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article explains why they believe they will never be rich. They prefer stable and reliable solutions, but their previous employer saw this as less profitable because unstable solutions requiring frequent maintenance would generate more revenue. The author believes that a job is well-done when it consistently works, not when it constantly needs fixing. They also mention that teams with constant downtimes are often seen as heroes, while those who have services running smoothly are the first to be let go in difficult financial times. Despite this, the author views their approach as the right thing to do, as it prioritizes quality over excitement.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the author's experience using a large copier that had a function to scan and email documents. The email delivery stopped working, despite using Gmail. The person responsible for the Gmail administration tried various troubleshooting methods, but nothing worked. Instead of relying on others or dealing with Gmail's proprietary issues, the author decided to set up an SMTP server using a $12 PogoPlug and a few hours of work. This allowed the copier to scan and deliver emails through a public SMTP server. The author emphasizes that people sometimes dismiss certain tasks as a waste of time because they don't know how to do them or because they assume everyone does things differently. The author concludes by mentioning that years later, someone from the company offered to return the PogoPlug, which had been used for several years before they replaced the copier.

## 5. [Writing Linux Modules in Ada (2016)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37288446)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's attempts to write Linux modules using the Ada programming language. Linux modules are binary files that can be dynamically loaded and linked into the Kernel, often used for device drivers. Traditionally, these modules are written in C, but the author explores using Ada instead, as it is designed for embedded safety critical applications. The author investigates the process of writing and building modules and explores the possibility of using a gpr file for compilation and linkage. However, they find the existing makefiles of the kbuild system too complex to understand and imitate. Instead, they propose a strategy where the logic of the module resides in Ada functions compiled into a static library, and the main file consists of C wrappers that call these Ada functions. The author addresses the issue of missing symbols when building the module and the challenges of linking with the standard run time. They propose building a custom, degraded run time known as a "Zero Footprint" run time. The article concludes by mentioning the author's intention to write a more useful kernel module in future articles.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's past experience working as an Email consultant and their intention to develop a secure collection of Email tools using the programming language Ada.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 A recent report by Los Alamos National Lab evaluates the risks associated with relying on the Fortran programming language for mission-critical codes over the next 15 years. The assessment highlights seven distinct risks, including difficulties staffing Fortran projects with top-rate computer scientists and engineers, potential maintenance costs, poor performance on future CPU technologies, and inhibiting the use of advances in computing technology. It is suggested that Fortran is becoming less popular in the field of high-performance computing, as scientists are increasingly using languages like C++ and Python for code development.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the current state of Fortran in the technology landscape, specifically in the context of high performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). Historically, Fortran was used for HPC and was largely funded by the government. However, with the rise of AI, other programming languages such as Python have gained prominence. Despite this, Fortran still has its advantages in terms of easy-to-read code and optimal performance. The article questions whether Fortran can regain its position or if new contenders will take over.
