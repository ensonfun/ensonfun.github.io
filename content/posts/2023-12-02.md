**Total comment counts : 80**

### Summary

 A study conducted by researchers at Massachusetts Eye and Ear has found a link between tinnitus and undetectable auditory nerve loss. The study challenges previous beliefs about tinnitus and opens up new possibilities for treatments focused on nerve regeneration. The researchers discovered that individuals with tinnitus, even those with normal hearing tests, experience auditory nerve loss that is not detected by conventional tests. Tinnitus can cause debilitating symptoms, including sleep deprivation, social isolation, anxiety, and depression. The researchers hope that understanding the mechanisms underlying tinnitus will eventually lead to a cure. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Lauer Tinnitus Research Center.

 This article suggests a couple of ideas for improvement. One idea involves using extra identical motors to create a rotating power transmission system. By disassembling two motors and using the brushes, it is possible to create a reliable system with a cap and rectifier. This eliminates the need for batteries and allows for image stability based on the actual position of the assembly. Another idea mentioned is transmitting power via induction, but the efficiency of this method was not sufficient. In order to make it work, the source voltage had to be increased to a level where fire safety became a concern. These ideas were derived from a Burning Man art project from 2001, and a prototype can be seen in the provided link.

## 6. [Electrocaloric material makes refrigerant-free solid-state fridge scalable](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38495666)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The December 2023 issue of IEEE Spectrum introduces the concept of refrigerant-free refrigerators that are portable and efficient. Traditional coolers, such as refrigerators and air conditioners, use vapor compression which is proven but inefficient and relies on greenhouse gas-emitting hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). However, there are alternative solid-state technologies that avoid these issues and can create miniature cooling devices. One such alternative is the electrocaloric effect, which involves using solid materials that change temperature under an electric field. Researchers have made significant progress in this area by developing a regenerative heat exchanger using a ceramic multilayer capacitor. By activating and deactivating the electric field, the material heats up and cools down, creating a temperature difference. The researchers achieved a record-breaking 20.9 °C difference between the hot and cold ends of the regenerator, along with a cooling power of 4.2 watts, which is a significant improvement over previous materials. However, further design iterations are needed before these electrocaloric coolers can be mass-produced. The current ceramic materials used are not suitable for mass production, and the researchers are also exploring the use of a more effective thermal conductor than the silicone oil they currently use. Additionally, the regenerator needs to be waterproofed to allow for the use of electrically conductive fluids like water, which would greatly increase cooling power. The article also mentions magnetocaloric materials as another technology that could be used for solid-state refrigerators.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of a syringe pump to push silicone oil through a stack, which is considered an improvement over the current refrigerant cycle. However, it questions the claim that this is a "solid state" solution. The article also mentions that the current ceramics used in the process are not suitable for mass production due to their toxicity, high cost, and association with conflict materials. Therefore, the desired solution is not currently available with the materials being used.

## 7. [New York will plant trees using new tech to maximize foliage impact](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38494529)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 New York City's city council has passed a measure calling for a 30% increase in tree canopy by 2035. A recent tree census found that the city has room for an additional 250,000 trees. The increase in trees is seen as a win for the environmental justice movement as cities worldwide aim to adapt to hotter temperatures caused by the climate crisis. However, determining the appropriate locations and tree types is more complex. A researcher at Cornell University has developed a 3D mapping tool called Tree Folio NYC, which uses lidar scans to provide a detailed visualization of each tree in the city. This allows researchers to understand the individual contributions of trees to specific areas and allocate resources accordingly. Expanding the city's tree canopy has numerous benefits, including boosting immunity, reducing stress and blood pressure, improving mood and focus, and increasing energy levels. However, communities of color have significantly less tree canopy compared to majority-white areas, which contributes to the urban heat island effect. Unequal distribution of trees can have deadly consequences, with black residents being twice as likely to die from heat exposure as white residents. Historically, trees have been planted for aesthetics and economic development rather than maximizing their climate benefits. Strategic tree placement can enhance their impact and ensure more equitable distribution. This approach could also improve the safety of streets by allocating more pedestrian space on sunnier sides, protecting bike lanes, and investing in overall pedestrian comforts. New York City has passed urban forestry laws to create an urban forest plan and monitor progress using lidar data.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the frustration and time-consuming process of working with an ESP32-based board. The author shares their experience of debugging code, cutting traces, soldering bridge wires, and using a logic analyzer. They found out that some of the pins on the ESP32 are strapping pins, which configure settings like voltage for the flash memory. The author mentions that blowing certain fuses can hardcode some of the strapping pin settings. Additionally, the default behavior of certain pins may be set to JTAG, requiring explicit reset to use them as input/output pins. The lesson from this experience is to check for strapping and default pin behavior if there is an issue with a microcontroller.
