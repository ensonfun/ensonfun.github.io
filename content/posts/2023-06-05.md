### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses an appreciation for the ML approach over the C++ kitchen sink approach, but still finds async in Rust to be complicated and not elegant. They also mention the benefits of having a BDFL over a committee when it comes to language design.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the optimization of performance in the inner loops of programs involving containers, iteration, indirect-access operations, and arithmetic. The author advocates for compiler builtins open-coded at the sites of use instead of library-provided operations. The argument against putting these operations in the compiler is that it would be confusing to users and frustrating that they cannot write their own code. Ultimately, the intrinsics are written in the compiler's intermediate representation language or IR. The goal is to have a clear separation between what is language and what is library.

## 3. [Our right to challenge junk patents is under threat](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36198329)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The US Patent Office's proposed new rules about who can challenge wrongly granted patents could benefit patent trolls, making it difficult and impossible for some to challenge patents. Organizations like EFF, which used the process to fight the Personal Audio "podcasting patent," may no longer be able to file patent challenges altogether. The new rules could exempt patent trolls from IPRs completely and prohibit anyone from challenging the patents of small entities and under-resourced inventors. It may be easy for even the most litigious patent trolls to portray themselves as small inventors, allowing them to game the system.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the negative impact of software patents on innovation and argues that they are out of control. The author cites economic and game theory, as well as historical evidence, to support the claim that intellectual property laws slow down innovation. The article also provides a link to a Wikipedia page that outlines criticisms of patents in general.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The United States Patent and Trademark Office has proposed a rule change that could severely limit the ability of small businesses, nonprofits, and individual inventors to challenge wrongfully granted patents.

The proposed rule change would make it substantially more difficult and expensive to file an inter partes review (IPR) against a patent. An IPR is a streamlined adversarial process designed to allow the patent office to correct its own errors by canceling wrongfully granted patents.

Many small businesses, nonprofits, and individual inventors rely on IPRs to defend themselves against frivolous patent lawsuits filed by so-called patent trolls. These are entities that amass large patent portfolios not to develop new products, but to use them as a basis for demanding payments from others. 

The proposed changes to the IPR process could potentially limit access to justice for these groups and benefit patent trolls who rely on weak patents.

## 4. [Sandstorm: Open-source platform for self-hosting web apps](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36192777)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 Sandstorm is an open-source project focused on providing an easy way to run a variety of open-source web applications. The platform includes features such as secure syncing of files using Rocket.Chat, the ability to store and share files with others using Davros, organizing tasks and ideas using Wekan, and collaborative document editing using Etherpad. The installation of apps is also made easy through the App Market, and all apps include automatic updates. Sandstorm also provides unified access control to all applications and keeps all data and applications in one secure place. Sandstorm takes an added security measure of keeping each document, chat room, or other file created as a “grain” and sandboxes each within its safe environment, where it cannot communicate with the world without permission. Furthermore, Sandstorm can adhere to regulatory and data privacy requirements and enables users to control their data location. Sandstorm also provides independent developers with the ability to build quality applications to be used without worrying about managing the service.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author finds it difficult to find supported apps for Caprover and assumes that Sandstorm has the same issue. They suggest that the LAMP stack with an interface like cPanel is the best option for self-hosting, as it supports many apps, is widely used, and offers easy access to essential features like PHP and PHPMyAdmin.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Sandstorm, noting that while the platform was ahead of its time, its ideas remain relevant through technologies like Capnproto. However, the article also acknowledges that the platform requires a significant amount of effort to integrate and update apps due to the centralized authorization framework. Despite the challenges, the author notes that the platform is secure and provides a glimpse into the future of self-hosting, which should be as easy as installing an app and setting up a domain with an OAuth2 flow.

## 5. [Google no longer automatically indexes websites?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36195600)

**Total comment counts : 72**

### Summary

 The author of the article urges website owners to use the site search filter on Google to check if Google is indexing their site and sending traffic to it. The author has noticed that Google is no longer automatically indexing websites, which is unusual because Google typically indexes every site whether the owner wants them to or not. The author suggests using the "URL Inspection" feature in Search Console to force Google to index each page, but this can be time-consuming for sites with hundreds of pages. The article also includes some comments and experiences from readers regarding their own websites and how they have been indexed by Google.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author notes that although Google may crawl your website, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's searchable. There have been instances where the search engine doesn't return a page even if the author has searched for specific phrases or unique words. The author also mentions the automatic CAPTCHA-hellban one can receive for using "site:" in their search and for searching "too much." The article concludes by saying that there's an increasing amount of information on sites that Google knows about but doesn't show users for unknown reasons, making it nearly impossible to find information on obscure topics.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article suggests that for those who know how the internet works, Google Search is in decline and they use it as a last resort and as other search engines and tools improve, it may disappear from bookmarks. However, the majority of non-tech savvy users still associate the internet with Google. The article predicts that this trend may change in the next five years.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Google acquired Qwiklabs in 2016, but it seems that the team is still operating as a separate entity with a third-party app that uses the "sign in with Google" feature. While some speculate this may be due to frustration with GCP, others suggest that the GCP docs organization is difficult to work with and could be blocking Qwiklabs' integration into Google proper.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article provides a compilation of AI learning resources that are categorized according to their relevance to building products, deploying custom models, or self-study towards AI research and engineering roles. The author believes that the resources they've collected will serve as a good starting point for most people. The link to the resources can be found at https://llm-utils.org/AI+Learning+Curation.

## 7. [I wrote my own smart home software](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36191688)

**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 The author discusses their experience with home automation and the challenges they faced in finding a software setup that met their needs. They tried several smart home automation servers but found them too complex and limited in terms of automation capabilities. They eventually settled on using the Raspbee 2 Zigbee Gateway and the Mako Server, a lightweight web server based on Lua, which allowed them to write code to interact with their smart devices via a REST API. The author provides instructions on how to get started with the Mako Server.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article recommends using Home Assistant rather than creating one's own software because the community is large and there are solutions to any problems that arise. The software is not fragile anymore but does have a steep learning curve for those with no experience in yaml or underlying tech. The article suggests that with the push for UI setup, it will become more accessible over time.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their experience with a home automation system they ran for a few years, describing it as great when it worked but fragile, overly complicated, and not well-engineered. The author prefers reliable home automation that requires minimal time investments and finds the ostentatiousness of HA irrelevant. The author highlights that HA often burns up solid-state storage due to excessive logging. The author prefers beautiful, reliable, and well-tested automation that seamlessly blends into their daily life and does not require them to play software engineer during their free time.

## 8. [Thousands of early-career NIH researchers forming union for first time](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36194950)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Early-career researchers at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) have launched a process of forming a union, named NIH Fellows United, comprising about 4,800 research fellows including graduate students and postdocs. The union plans to increase pay and improve benefits in addition to bolstering policies and procedures covering harassment and excessive workloads. The filing kicks off a months-long process that they hope will end in the union being officially recognised by the US government and the NIH.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author, a scientist, believes that academic scientists are underpaid but argues that unionization is not the solution. Unions are powerful because of the threat of striking, but striking is less impactful in the individualistic field of science where every scientific publication is directly attributed to a few specific contributors and is crucial for advancing an individual's scientific career. Passionate and individually invested scientists are less likely to suspend their work voluntarily, making striking less effective and negating much of a scientific union's power.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is expressing a hope for better living and working conditions for researchers in the US, who should be well-funded and not subjected to harassment.

## 9. [Mystery math whiz and novelist advance permutation problem](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36191831)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 A math problem posted anonymously on online bulletin board 4chan in 2011, asking about the best way to watch cult classic anime series The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, has surprised professional mathematicians. The question related to the minimum number of episodes a viewer would need to watch to see all possible permutations of the episodes shown in nonchronological order across its first season. A lower bound of 93,884,313,611 episodes was quickly produced by the anonymous poster, followed recently by Greg Egan's upper bound of n! + (n – 1)! + (n – 2)! + (n – 3)! + n – 3, which Houston and Pantone soon verified was accurate.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article notes an interesting observation about the field of mathematics, which the author considers to have high integrity. The author points out that the 4Chan user who posted a proof was listed as a first author by those who wrote a proof based on his post.
