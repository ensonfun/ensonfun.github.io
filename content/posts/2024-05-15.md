## 1. [Translation of Rust's core and alloc crates to Coq for formal verification](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40363744)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the work being done to verify Rust programs using the tool coq-of-rust, which translates Rust code to the Coq formal proof system. One limitation the team faced was handling primitive constructs from the standard library, so they worked on translating the core and alloc crates of Rust using coq-of-rust. The resulting translation generated large amounts of Coq code, although it had some compilation errors. The team split the output into separate files for each input Rust file to resolve module name collisions. Currently, 4% of the files do not compile in Coq. The article also discusses the translation of the Option::unwrap_or_default method and the need for further verification of the Rust code. The team aims to simplify the proof process and invites those interested in formal verification for Rust projects to get in touch.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the coq-of-rust project, which is an automatic translator from Rust to Coq. The author suggests that the correctness of the translator can be verified by using coq-of-rust to convert itself from Rust to Coq and then proving its correctness properties within Coq. By comparing the output of the Coq translator with the original Rust translator, the author argues that the correctness of the translator can be established. The article also mentions the positive implications of industry funding for projects like this, noting that cryptocurrency's emphasis on correctness can drive improvements in programming languages and funding opportunities.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the size of programs that have been verified using semi-automated deductive proof systems like Coq. It states that the size of these verified programs is relatively small compared to the overall size of programs. While sound software verification is important for proving the correctness of core algorithms, it does not scale well. Therefore, there has been a shift in research towards unsound methods because the cost of 100% assurance is much higher than 99.9999%, and the difference in probability may be lower than non-software failures or specs that do not conform well to reality.

## 6. [Proteins in blood could provide early cancer warning 'by more than seven years'](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40366443)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 A study conducted by scientists at the University of Oxford has identified 618 proteins in the blood that are linked to 19 types of cancer. The researchers analyzed blood samples from over 44,000 individuals, including those who later received a cancer diagnosis. They found 107 proteins associated with cancers diagnosed more than seven years after the blood sample was taken and 182 proteins strongly linked to a cancer diagnosis within three years. The findings suggest that these proteins could be used for early cancer detection and potentially offer new treatment options. Another study examined genetic data from over 300,000 cancer cases and identified 40 proteins in the blood that influence the risk of developing nine types of cancer. However, altering these proteins may have unintended side effects. The results of these studies represent progress towards identifying markers of increased cancer risk and aiding early diagnosis.

## 8. [Ancient Eastern European mega-sites: a social levelling concept?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40353842)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article discusses the emergence and abandonment of the Chalcolithic Trypillia mega-sites and explores the role of social inequality in these processes. The authors use Gini coefficients based on house sizes to assess inequality between households in approximately 7000 houses at 38 Trypillia sites. The results indicate temporarily reduced social inequality at the mega-sites, but increased social differentiation emerged after several generations, potentially leading to the abandonment of these settlements. The study suggests that social complexity does not always result in greater social stratification, and large populations can find ways to reduce inequality. The Trypillia mega-sites were among the largest prehistoric communities in Europe, characterized by agricultural settlements with an economy based on farming and animal husbandry. The article emphasizes the importance of the social fabric in understanding the rise and fall of these mega-sites and analyzes wealth differences between households using Gini coefficients. The study utilizes data from extensive excavations and geophysical surveys, drawing on a long-term cooperation between various institutions and regional partners.
