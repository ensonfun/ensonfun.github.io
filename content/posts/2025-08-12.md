## 1. [Wikipedia loses challenge against Online Safety Act](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44866208)

**Total comment counts : 83**

### Summary

 Wikipedia's parent organization, the Wikimedia Foundation, lost a legal challenge to the UK's Online Safety Act, which could require identity verification from its contributors, potentially threatening their privacy. The High Court emphasized the responsibility of Ofcom and the UK government to protect Wikipedia. The foundation argued that classifying Wikipedia as a "Category 1" site would impose excessive regulations designed for larger social media platforms. Despite the ruling, Wikimedia remains open to future legal challenges against the regulations, as the court did not fully endorse the government's stance.

### Summary

 OpenSSH now supports post-quantum cryptographic key agreement algorithms to protect against potential quantum computer attacks. Since version 9.0, it has used the sntrup761x25519-sha512 algorithm and recently introduced the mlkem768x25519-sha256 algorithm as the default in version 10.0. Starting with version 10.1, users will receive warnings if they connect using non-post-quantum algorithms, highlighting vulnerability to "store now, decrypt later" attacks. While quantum computers capable of breaking current cryptography are not yet available, transitioning to post-quantum algorithms is recommended to secure user data for the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 OpenSSH's post-quantum algorithms are hybrids that merge a post-quantum scheme with a classical algorithm, ensuring security remains robust. For instance, the mlkem768x25519-sha256 algorithm combines the ML-KEM post-quantum key agreement with the classical ECDH/x25519. This approach guarantees that even if the post-quantum algorithm is compromised in the future, the overall security will not drop below that of existing classical algorithms. Thus, users maintain the same level of security as prior to quantum advancements.
