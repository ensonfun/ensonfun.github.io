## 1. [How Bear does analytics with CSS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38095699)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The article discusses the design constraints and challenges of creating an analytics system for the Bear Blog platform. The author aims to build a native analytics system for Bear that does not rely on client-side JavaScript, as JavaScript can be blocked by adblockers and affect the accuracy of analytics. Instead, the author proposes using CSS to trigger a URL analytics endpoint when a person hovers their cursor over the webpage. This method helps determine if the user is a human reader rather than a bot. The author also discusses how they handle the issue of storing and identifying reader information. They use the IP address to determine the country and hash it along with the date to create a unique identifier for each read of a page. The IP address hashes are then scrubbed from the hit logs at the end of each day to comply with privacy regulations. The author acknowledges that this method may result in multiple reads from the same IP address being counted as one read, but they consider it a minor issue. Overall, the author believes this analytics system provides an accurate count of reads while being concise and simpler compared to other analytics methods.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In the article, the author clarifies that IP address hashes are used to prevent duplicate hits in a day and make each page view unique by default. At the end of each day, a worker job empties the IP address hashes while keeping the hit information. The author has edited the essay to provide further clarity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of using CSS-triggered requests for analytics. The author mentions an example where someone used this technique for mouse tracking by overlaying an invisible grid on a webpage and triggering specific requests to the server based on hover events. The author also mentions their own project of building a JS-free chat application using only CSS.

## 2. [Improving deep sleep may prevent dementia, study finds](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38097184)

**Total comment counts : 41**

### Summary

 A study conducted by Monash University suggests that a decline in deep sleep, also known as slow wave sleep, in individuals over the age of 60 increases the risk of dementia. The study analyzed 346 participants from the Framingham Heart Study who underwent two overnight sleep studies, with an average of five years between the two studies. The researchers found that the amount of deep sleep decreased over time, indicating a loss of slow wave sleep with aging. Over a 17-year follow-up period, 52 cases of dementia were identified. Each percentage decrease in deep sleep per year was associated with a 27% increase in the risk of dementia, even after adjusting for various factors. The researchers suggest that slow wave sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for dementia and that maintaining or enhancing deep sleep may help prevent the development of dementia. The study also found that a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, but not brain volume, was associated with accelerated declines in slow wave sleep.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience as a slow metabolizer of caffeine and how it affects their sleep quality. They mention that even a small amount of caffeine can disrupt their sleep, causing them to wake up multiple times during the night. The author has tried eating cruciferous vegetables and taking a broccoli supplement to speed up caffeine metabolism but found no improvement. They also mention that exercise helps slightly, but not enough to achieve the same quality of sleep as when they avoid caffeine altogether. The author experimented with micro-dosing 5-Hour Energy and initially found some promise, but eventually, the caffeine buildup in their system led to a deterioration in sleep quality. Ultimately, they conclude that they cannot drink caffeine and have good sleep quality, which frustrates them.

 error

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that Meta, the company behind a popular platform, had promised to ask users if they wanted to opt in to certain behaviors, but never followed through. As a result, they are now banning these behaviors until they can find a better way to handle them. Additionally, Meta had proposed that those who opted out of data sharing should have to pay, which is likely to be illegal.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article believes that the focus on ads as a source of manipulation is misplaced. Instead, they argue that pages, groups, and the posts generated by "users" are more concerning. According to the author, many of these "users" are not even real humans.

## 4. [uBlock Origin 1.53](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38094620)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article is about taking user feedback seriously and providing documentation. It also mentions commits made since the last release and instructions for installing the stable build.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a feature in the Firefox browser where it waits for an ad-blocking extension called uBO to be ready before sending network requests from already opened tabs. This ensures that tracker and advertisement payloads are properly filtered. In contrast, Chromium-based browsers, like Google Chrome, do not have this feature. As a result, tracker and advertisement payloads can make their way into already opened tabs before the ad-blocker is ready. The article views this as a bug in Chromium and questions the engineer responsible for the oversight and any potential promotions they may have received.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article has been using uBlock, an ad blocker, for a long time and believes that it is essential for browsing the internet. They feel that using a browser without an ad blocker fundamentally alters the browsing experience and they would rather give up access to all Google services than forego using an ad blocker.

## 7. [Rob Pike’s Rules of Programming (1989)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38097031)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article discusses Rob Pike's 5 rules of programming. The rules are as follows: 1) You can't predict where a program will spend its time, so don't try to optimize prematurely. 2) Measure the code's performance before making any optimizations. 3) Fancy algorithms can be slow when dealing with small data sets, so only use them when necessary. 4) Simple algorithms and data structures are less buggy and easier to implement than complex ones. 5) Data structures are more important than algorithms in programming. These rules are based on the principles of simplicity and choosing the right data structures. The article also mentions that Pike's first two rules align with Tony Hoare's saying, "Premature optimization is the root of all evil," and his third and fourth rules are similar to Ken Thompson's advice to "use brute force" when unsure. Similarly, Pike's fifth rule echoes Fred Brooks' idea in The Mythical Man-Month.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that data structures are more important than algorithms in programming. The author agrees with this and finds it odd that many interviews focus on algorithms rather than data structures. They believe that understanding algorithms is relatively easy to teach, but knowing which data structures to use is more difficult.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article suggests that fancy algorithms are generally slower when dealing with small inputs, emphasizing that most cases involve small inputs. They state that these algorithms have larger constants and should only be used when dealing with large inputs. The author advises using Rule 2 first, even if the inputs eventually become large. They offer an example where people overestimate the need for optimization due to underestimating the speed of computers. The author concludes that while it is important to think, modern computing hardware is incredibly fast.

## 8. [Atari Video Music](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38060517)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The Atari Video Music, released in 1977, is considered the earliest electronic music visualizer. It responds to music input from a stereo system, creating animated visual displays for entertainment. The system interprets the musical waveform and translates the intensity and mellowness into colors and shapes displayed on a TV screen. The Video Music can be toggled between "TV" and "Game" modes, with visual data broadcast on VHF channel 3 (default) or channel 4. Unlike previous Atari systems, the Video Music's switch box allows for the TV antenna or cable to remain attached. It can visualize audio from any source, including Atari video games, and can be recorded using a balun converter. The unit is connected to a TV through an RF switchbox and audio amplifier through RCA inputs. It is controlled using potentiometer knobs and push buttons. The Video Music was designed by Robert Brown and was commercially unsuccessful, being discontinued after one year. Reviews described it as an interesting component for stereo sound but warned that the display could become monotonous after the novelty wore off.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the shift in popularity from visualizers to live video jockeying (VJ) in the realm of DJ performances. DJs are now collaborating with VJs to create visually engaging experiences that enhance the music. The live performances often incorporate techniques like raymarching, geometry manipulation, and progressions inspired by the demoscene. The article also provides links to a few examples of these live performances.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions an incident involving a design engineer from Atari and a representative from Sears. During a promotional tour, the representative jokingly asked the engineers what they were smoking when they created a device. In response, one of the technicians held up a lit joint.

## 9. [Why ACPI?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38095276)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses how device-specific code often never makes it to the mainline. The author suggests using UEFI EBC in DTs as a way to approximate ACPI semantics within DT. They believe this is the only option for "embedded-brained" people who are familiar with ARM in the kernel.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the dynamic configuration problem in hardware and compares it to the old mainframe and minicomputer operating systems of the 1970s. These systems would start with a configuration to support limited devices and would recompile the operating system for the specific hardware configuration. This eliminated the need for dynamic configuration and had a "systems programmer" at each installation. The article then talks about the adoption of dynamic configuration in the industry to allow hot plugging and changing hardware configurations without causing downtime.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article worked on the Windows kernel team and their first major projects were implementing ACPI 1 and 2. At the time, there were gaps in the BIOS and it was decided to move ACPI into the kernel to address this issue. Additionally, there was a push from the industry to use EFI, which would allow devices to have a pre-OS experience and not rely on Windows for certain tasks, such as playing DVDs. Power management was also a significant priority during this time, and it is suspected that the strategic decision to use ACPI enabled the operating system to support power management capabilities. However, the author was not directly involved in the decision-making process.

## 10. [Tao Te Ching – Gia-Fu Feng, Jane English Translation (1989)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38058843)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article is a collection of excerpts from the Tao Te Ching, a ancient Chinese philosophical text attributed to Lao Tzu. The excerpts cover a range of topics, including the nature of the Tao (the underlying principle of the universe), the importance of balance and harmony, and the qualities of a wise and virtuous person. The passages emphasize the value of simplicity, humility, and non-action in living a fulfilling and meaningful life.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the visually inspiring nature of the Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English translation of a book, originally published by Random House. It mentions that the oversized print copy includes black-and-white photography by English and artful Chinese calligraphy from Gia-Fu. The article also mentions that Gia-Fu and Jane English also published a translation of Chuang Tzu in the same beautiful format.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of translating the Tao Te Ching, highlighting the ambiguity of the Chinese language and the intentional use of puns in the text. Translators are faced with the task of interpreting the source text into specific meanings in the target language, which can be likened to opening Schrödinger's cat box or unraveling monads in programming languages. The article suggests that those who are interested in understanding the Tao Te Ching may benefit from learning basic Chinese and classical Chinese and utilizing dictionaries for decryption. Additionally, the article proposes the idea of a new form of digital translation that would display all possible meanings of words or expressions, similar to the hovering texts feature on Duolingo.
