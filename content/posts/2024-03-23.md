### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a simulation's unique way of representing time. Each level of the simulation is composed of a multitude of smaller steps from the level below, creating an exponential vortex. As you zoom out, time slows down significantly, with each step taking days, years, or even millennia to change. The simulator cleverly adjusts its speed as you zoom, making time appear seamless. The author suggests adding an indicator to track the amount of game time passing in real-life seconds, but acknowledges that designating a specific level as the "bottom" level would ruin the fractal nature of the simulation.

## 8. [Post-quantum cryptography is too damn big](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39796349)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article discusses the transition to post-quantum cryptography in response to the threat of quantum computers breaking common forms of encryption used on the internet. The author argues that the algorithms standardized by NIST are not suitable for deployment on the public web due to their large size. They explain that while key exchange algorithms can be updated to be quantum resistant, signatures and public keys used for server identity authentication in HTTPS are too large. This poses a challenge for deploying post-quantum cryptography without significantly impacting latency and data transmission. The author concludes that smaller, more efficient algorithms are needed to effectively mitigate the threat of quantum computers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of implementing post-quantum cryptography. It mentions that the size and performance issues are not a major concern, such as slightly slower HTTPS handshakes. The real worry lies in small, secure, embedded devices that lack sufficient memory and computational power to run these algorithms. Even the most advanced hardware-accelerated implementations of post-quantum cryptography require large amounts of memory and silicon area, making them impractical for lower-end devices.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the status of digital signature algorithms and the need for protecting non-secret content against forgery. It suggests using subresource integrity, which allows the parent page to use HTTPS, while the assets can use HTTP but are locked to specific content. This approach is seen as more useful for security than encryption, as it prevents the loading of modified third-party JavaScript files and promotes a more stable web.

## 10. [SQL is syntactic sugar for relational algebra](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39753749)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of "syntactic sugar" in relation to SQL (Structured Query Language). It argues that the traditional understanding of syntactic sugar, which implies that certain language features can be removed without affecting functionality, does not fully capture the complexities of SQL. The author highlights how the translation from SQL queries to relational algebra, a mathematical framework for working with relational databases, involves non-local rules and dependencies on factors like scoping, type inference, and the database schema. These factors make the translation process more intricate and extensive compared to simpler cases like translating Scheme to x86 assembly. The article concludes that SQL's translation process goes beyond typical syntactic sugar and involves a significant amount of non-syntactic considerations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article shares their perspective on learning and mastering SQL. They mention that it took them approximately 10 years of working in data-intensive programming before they could write proficient SQL code. They attribute the difficulty to the fact that SQL is a language that is parsed in a backwards manner compared to other programming languages. Instead of starting with what you have and narrowing it down, in SQL, you start with what you want (the SELECT statement). Additionally, understanding the structure of the database is crucial before being confident in what a query will do. The author suggests accepting SQL for what it is, acknowledging its unique characteristics and flexibility. They emphasize the importance of understanding the database and knowing the desired end result before constructing the necessary subqueries or building blocks to achieve it. Trial and error is also mentioned as a part of the learning process.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the shortcomings and strengths of SQL, particularly from the perspective of a relational query language. The author mentions implementing a composable SQL generator and notes that SQL offers powerful primitives that are difficult to find in other languages. They highlight features like declaring functions as stable or immutable, optimizing repeated calls, considering parallelization, and aiding optimizer cost estimation. The author also expresses awe over SQL's transaction isolation and locking primitives, suggesting that these aspects of SQL could be useful in everyday programming. Overall, the article highlights SQL's advanced functionality compared to other general-purpose programming languages.
