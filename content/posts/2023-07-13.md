### Summary

 Lantern Bioworks is seeking funding for BCS3-L1, a genetically engineered bacteria designed to prevent dental cavities. The bacteria was previously tested successfully in animal trials and human volunteers but the developing company declined to market it, instead opting to sell once-daily probiotic mouthwash. Recreating BCS3-L1 is not prevented by law, although the original inventors are the only holders of the organism. Lantern Bioworks is open to receiving funding as an investment and their chances of success are deemed high by the team.

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses the difficulties involved in converting an Xbox360 game into a PC-compatible format. Technical challenges include differences in CPU and memory layout, encryption, outdated GPU architecture, and inlining of kernel functions. However, the author believes that it is still possible to achieve this conversion and outlines the steps taken to disassemble the game's code, identify blocks, and generate C++ functions. The final result is a DLL with pointers to all block functions, allowing for easy retrieval of the block containing the code for a given instruction pointer.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that emulators like CXBX for the original Xbox do not work well due to a mismatch between the code and actual Xbox hardware, leading to less surface area for the full system emulator approach. The complexity burden overwhelms the project, causing it to stagnate after some tech demo samples and a couple of bespoke games work okay.

## 8. [Figma Is a File Editor](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36702939)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges faced by developers when trying to ship desktop-class apps to the browser, particularly when it comes to file editors, which do not translate as naturally to web architecture as database apps. The article uses Figma as an example of a file editor that runs in the browser and explains how Figma's infrastructure avoids problems that could arise from treating S3 as a network file system. Instead, Figma loads files in two places, writes back only the changed data, and stores file metadata in a Postgres database. The article concludes by discussing Jamsocket and Plane's recent introduction of "locking" to guarantee that at most one backend runs per document in an effort to build an open-source document database that takes a similar approach to Figma.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 CloudFlare's new Durable Objects can ensure synchronization between multiple users who open the same Fig file concurrently. This helps eliminate race conditions without overloading databases. Durable Objects also offer a transactional storage capability, which helps in scaling write transactions without melting the database. The article argues that Durable Objects could be useful for more demanding backends, and recommends separating metadata and "blobs" data for better organization.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article praises the impressive technology behind Figma but criticizes the fact that current collaborative tools are expected to be used collaboratively all the time. They claim that they only spend around 10% of their time using Figma for collaboration and the remaining 90% of their time is spent working alone. The author argues that an "offline mode" would be a valuable feature, but this is unlikely since Figma's entire stack is built around collaboration.
