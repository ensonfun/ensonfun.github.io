## 1. [NixOS RFC 136 approved: A plan to stabilize the new CLI and Flakes incrementally](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37105524)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses an RFC (Request for Comments) that aims to establish general principles about Nix's architecture and evolution and create a plan to stabilize the CLI (Command Line Interface) and Flakes features incrementally. The goal is to address longstanding tensions in the Nix community and ensure a smooth process for future changes. The article also mentions concerns about the design of Flakes and the potential impact on subfeatures. Some discussions revolve around the need for a more stringent process and the potential consequences of stabilizing Flakes without addressing criticism. Overall, there is a call for a well-defined plan and community input to move forward with the stabilization process.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses several issues with using flakes in the Nix package manager. The author highlights three main problems:

1. Building third-party flakes is time-consuming because each flake has its own version of nixpkgs. If the third-party flake URLs are not pinned, they may change unexpectedly, causing issues when rerunning commands.

2. Flakes are closely tied to git. Changes made in an editor need to be staged before rebuilding, which can be easily overlooked, leading to confusion about why the latest changes are not included in the build.

3. Flakes copy the entire directory into the nix store, which is problematic for mono-repos and large files. There is a suggestion to make this copying lazy, but it would only address some symptoms and not solve the underlying problem. The author proposes that specifying the copying explicitly in flake.nix would be a better approach, allowing for custom file filters and reducing the reliance on git and its staging area.

They want to know if anyone has tried this approach and what the practical experience has been like.

## 2. [VirGL – A virtual 3D GPU for use inside QEMU virtual machines](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37105653)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 VirGL is a project that aims to create a virtual 3D GPU for use in QEMU virtual machines. This allows the guest operating system to utilize the graphics capabilities of the host GPU for accelerated 3D rendering. The design of the virtual graphics card is based on the concepts of Gallium3D, making it easy to develop Mesa and Direct3D drivers. The rendering implementation is done in the host system using OpenGL, allowing for accelerated rendering on any compatible card and driver combination. The project also includes a complete Linux guest stack with drivers for the Linux kernel, X.org 2D DDX, and Mesa 3D. The project is primarily focused on the desktop virtualization use case, where the viewer, host, and guest are all running on the same machine. The project is currently investigating remoting rendering, Windows guest support, and passing through GPU capabilities to other architectures. The development of the project is being done upstream and is primarily led by Dave Airlie at Red Hat.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that an experimental Windows driver has been released for KVM guest drivers on GitHub.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes VirGL as an inadequate solution for virtualized graphics, suggesting it only exists because hardware manufacturers like AMD, Intel, and Nvidia refuse to support VFIO on all GPUs. It argues that this refusal stems from their "infinite greed" and compares it to the widespread support for IOMMU on CPUs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a suggestion by the author's optimistic father to use a statistical approach to match patterns on an eggshell as a project. The father's goal was to use this approach for reassembling fragmented Hebrew scrolls. The author mentions that this idea could be more feasible now compared to when it was originally suggested during the Vax 11/780 days. The author also mentions that their father pursued stylometry as a hobby alongside more serious computer science and VLSI work at Edinburgh University. However, the author declined to attempt the project as they felt it was too complex for them.

## 5. [ML is useful for many things, but not for predicting scientific replicability](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37089573)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses a paper published in the PNAS journal that claims machine learning (ML) can detect non-replicable scientific findings. However, the authors of the article argue that the ML model described in the paper has major drawbacks. They criticize the small training sample used for the model and the potential for ML methods to be easily manipulated. The authors also express concerns about the model being used for consequential decisions such as funding allocations. They highlight the different linguistic styles across subfields of psychology and question the model's ability to generalize. The authors conclude that ML for replication is not currently useful for making important decisions and express skepticism about its future utility.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a research paper being replicated based on its text. The model uses an ensemble of random forest and logistic regression models and is trained on a dataset of 2 million social science publication abstracts from 2000 to 2017. The model converts the publications into vectors using word2vec, and combines the normalized word frequencies with corresponding word vectors to create a paper-level vector representing the paper's content. However, the article also points out limitations of the model, including its inability to detect rearranged words with different meanings, differentiate between quotations and references, and understand content written directly by the authors.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a study that used a model to determine if scientific studies were replicable based on the language used in the papers. The author argues that the model fails because it is trained on published results and does not take into account that scientists can derive valuable information from poor data or poorly described methods. They suggest that a better approach would be to have a systematic reporting method specific to each field, which would improve replicability. However, implementing this would require coordination between different research groups, and the author suggests that this could be enforced by funding agencies such as the NIH or NSF.

## 6. [A Blog Post with Every HTML Element](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37104742)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The author of the article explores various HTML elements and makes changes to their website to incorporate each element. They discuss their experiences and thoughts on using different elements, including <article>, <main>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <header>, <footer>, <h1>, <h2>, <aside>, <section>, <blockquote>, <cite>, <dd>, <dl>, <dt>, <div>, <hr>, <ol>, <ul>, <menu>, <p>, <pre>, <a>, <abbr>, <b>, <strong>, <bdi>, <br>, <cite>, <q>, <code>, <data>, <dfn>, <em>, <i>, <kbd>, <mark>, <rp>, <rt>, <ruby>, <s>, <samp>, <small>, <span>, <sub>, <sup>, <time>, <u>, <var>, and <wbr>. They provide insights and reflections on the usage of each element.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of deprecated elements in web development, specifically the <frame> and <frameset> elements. These elements were commonly used in the early days of the web to create multi-page layouts with persistent headers and sidebars. Each frame acted independently, which could lead to issues with navigation and content loading. CSS has largely replaced the need for frames, making them less common in modern web development.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the confusion surrounding the `<menu>` element in HTML. The author mentions that they were surprised it survived in HTML 5 while `<menuitem>` did not. They researched on Wikipedia and found that `<menu>` existed in earlier HTML versions, was deprecated in HTML 4.0, redefined in HTML 5, but removed in HTML 5.2. However, the WhatWG HTML Living Standard, which replaced HTML 5.2, still supports `<menu>` and defines it as a toolbar consisting of an unordered list of items representing user commands. The author suggests that the Wikipedia information on HTML versions may be outdated and advises using a `<ul>` element with an appropriate ARIA role attribute instead of `<menu>` due to its history of deprecation and confusion over semantics.

## 7. [Solving a simple puzzle using SymPy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37106560)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses a problem involving partitioning a square into smaller rectangles of equal area. The problem asks for the area of the large square based on the given side length of the smaller rectangles. Equations are built to represent the known side length, the sum of the smaller rectangle sides, and the equal areas of the rectangles. The equations are solved using SymPy, and the side length of the square is obtained by adding 3 to the yellow height. The article also mentions the technology used to create the page.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a problem involving rectangles of different colors. It states that the yellow, green, and pink rectangle is 3 times the area of the orange rectangle. Since the two rectangles have the same width, the combined rectangle must have 3 times the height of the orange rectangle. It concludes that the height of the yellow rectangle is 9, resulting in a side length of 12 and an area of 144.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the calculation of the area and dimensions of a series of rectangles. It proposes that the vertical width of the bottom-left-most rectangle can be expressed as (3x + 3y)/y, where x is the horizontal width of the adjacent rectangles and y is the horizontal width of the bottom-left-most rectangle. By analyzing the dimensions and area of the rectangles, the article concludes that x = 2y, which leads to the vertical width of the bottom-left-most rectangle being 9 units. Therefore, the left side width is calculated to be 12 units, and since the overall shape is a square, the entire square's area is determined to be 144 square units.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 I'm sorry, but I am unable to access or summarize specific web pages. Could you please provide some details or context about the article you would like me to summarize?

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of whether or not downloading a YouTube video can be considered fair use. The RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) claims that the youtube-dl tool, used for downloading videos, is a method of circumventing copy protection. The article highlights that a specific section of the law, 17 USC 1201(a)(2), is solely concerned with keeping copying tools off the market and does not consider fair use. The author draws a comparison to the hypothetical scenario of banning tape decks that can record radio broadcasts. This ban would be effective regardless of fair use. The author argues that Section 1201(a)(2) should be removed from the law, as access to copying tools should not be eliminated due to difficulties in enforcing copyright.
