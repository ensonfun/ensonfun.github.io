**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 Apple has been found in breach of new EU laws aimed at promoting competition and consumer choice in the app store. The European Commission's preliminary findings indicate that Apple's rules prevent app developers from steering consumers to alternative channels and charging excessive fees. Apple has 12 months to comply or face fines of up to 10% of its global revenues. This is the third non-compliance investigation opened by the commission into Apple since the Digital Markets Act (DMA) came into force last year. The commission has also launched inquiries into Google and Meta. Apple has made changes to comply with the DMA but maintains that its plan is lawful.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses a desire for the United States to adopt the same practices as the European Union (EU) when it comes to software control. They criticize the fact that one company, Apple, has significant power over what software can be published and charges a tax on all software sold. They argue that although there are alternative platforms available, most US consumers use iPhones and are likely unaware of Apple's control over app developers and software publication. The author also mentions that Apple reviews all software and empowers low-level employees to make decisions that can potentially harm entire companies.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author believes that the EU is wrong for asking the App Store to be fee free because there are costs associated with running it. They argue that allowing third party stores would lead to scams and data leaks. The author also suggests that developers already benefit from the App Store by having their apps displayed and sold without chargebacks or running costs. They feel threatened as a user and predict that more apps will require constant location access in the future.

It states that most advice for React JS can be applied to React Lua with some modifications due to language differences. The article also mentions that React Lua is intended to replace the Roact project and aims to be compatible with it. It provides information on deviations from Roact and suggests using appropriate equivalents for Lua language differences.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article provides some background information on a project that is a fork of `roblox/react-lua`. The purpose of the project is to open it up for community engagement and it utilizes Roblox's Luau, which is described as a fast, small, safe, gradually typed scripting language derived from Lua. The article also mentions that Roblox started using Lua 5.1 as a scripting language for games in 2006 and over the years made adjustments to ensure a safe and secure environment.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is questioning why React is used in Roblox instead of Lua, which they believed was only used for scripting. They are trying to understand how React is used in Roblox to build UI elements, as they had assumed that Roblox only allowed for writing Lua-scripts to handle events and modify the game flow. They express their excitement about React's ability to manage state and presentation in a full UI element, which they find surprising.

## 6. [US prosecutors recommend Justice Department criminally charge Boeing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40773151)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 U.S. prosecutors are recommending that criminal charges be brought against Boeing for violating a settlement related to two fatal crashes. They found that the company breached a 2021 agreement that had shielded Boeing from a criminal charge of conspiracy to commit fraud. Under the agreement, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion and make compliance changes to avoid prosecution. Boeing disagrees with the determination that it violated the settlement. The Justice Department must decide by July 7 whether to prosecute. Options include extending the settlement or proposing new terms. Prosecutors are considering charges beyond the original fraud conspiracy charge. The strictest settlements usually involve financial penalties and a third party to monitor compliance. Boeing is hesitant to plead guilty, as it could impact its business relationships, particularly with the U.S. government. Families of the crash victims have criticized the 2021 agreement and are pushing for a nearly $25 billion fine and criminal prosecution.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests expropriating at least 51% of a company, allowing public officials to take control and establish necessary checks and controls. The shares would then be sold, with a small portion retained for state oversight. Current stock owners would lose half of their value as punishment for their lack of oversight. This would grant the state access to privileged company information to prosecute those responsible, while top executives would be replaced and have their compensation reduced by half. The goal is to reset the company on a more solid foundation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Boeing has faced a series of troubling revelations recently. The company has been found to have used counterfeit titanium, retaliated against whistleblowers, hidden faulty parts from regulators, and lost those parts. These incidents are not isolated and indicate a larger problem within the company.

## 9. [Formal methods: Just good engineering practice?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40753989)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 In this article, the author argues that formal methods are an important aspect of good software engineering practice. They claim that software engineers working on large-scale systems, distributed systems, or critical low-level systems should incorporate formal methods into their approach to optimize time and money. The author acknowledges that formal methods can be costly and not easily integrated into every software engineering approach, but argues that they can prevent rework and reduce the cost of change. They suggest that software with well-understood requirements, such as those in large-scale, distributed, and low-level systems, can benefit greatly from formal design. The article also discusses the value of agile approaches for software that is heavily driven by evolving or hard-to-formalize user requirements. Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of considering the specific requirements and context of a software project when deciding on the optimal engineering approach.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of current formal methods tools, such as TLA+, in ensuring that algorithms implemented in code match the specifications proven in these tools. It suggests that formal methods should be integrated into programming languages, like SPARK 2014 or Design by Contract (DbC), to generate code that interacts with existing libraries and performs well. This would prevent the need for manual rewriting of generated code.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the quote by Arthur Wellington about engineering not being solely about construction but rather about doing things efficiently and effectively with limited resources.
