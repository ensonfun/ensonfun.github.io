## 1. [Home Assistant blocked from integrating with Garage Door opener API](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38188162)

**Total comment counts : 91**

### Summary

 The MyQ integration will be removed from Home Assistant in December 2023. Chamberlain Group, the owners of MyQ, have decided to block access to third-party apps, including the MyQ integration. This decision has caused issues for Home Assistant users, as the integration breaks and gets fixed repeatedly. Chamberlain Group claims that blocking unauthorized access will improve the performance and reliability of MyQ. Home Assistant has reached out to Chamberlain Group in an attempt to find a solution but has not received a response. As an open-source project, Home Assistant cannot pay a partnership fee to become an authorized partner. Therefore, the MyQ integration will be removed from Home Assistant. Users are recommended to use ratgdo, a device that connects to MyQ garage door openers and allows for local control. Home Assistant urges users to avoid supporting companies that mistreat their customers and to choose products that work locally and do not rely on third parties.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that there is not much value in the analytics of IoT (Internet of Things) devices. They argue that the two main revenue streams in the IoT space are charging for video storage and charging for commercial access. Chamberlain, the company mentioned, offers both of these services through their MyQ cameras and garage access program. Chamberlain aims to reduce fraud for retailers like Amazon and Walmart through their "In garage delivery" service, which prevents users from falsely claiming package theft. However, the author explains that due to security issues with wireless protocols used in garage doors, Chamberlain's solution is not effective, and other industries like automotive have more secure encryption systems. The author implies that the decision to focus on monetization rather than addressing foundational issues was misguided.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Chamberlain is described as having a monopoly in the market, with customers being affected by recent changes that caused a "DDoS" incident. The company claims the changes were made to promote their official products, but it has discontinued a local hub that did not require their cloud service. The timing of the API breakage coincides with the appointment of a new CTO who aims to transform the company into a smart access software company. It is unclear whether the CTO lacks understanding or is intentionally blaming users for the "DDoS" incident. However, a local solution called ratgdo, using ESP technology, is recommended as a good alternative.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that while clean code is important, people generally do not care about it. However, if your boss and coworkers are doing their jobs well, they will communicate if your code is helping or hindering their work. Clean code should be focused on being understandable, usable, and easily modifiable, as that is what people actually care about.

**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 Chamberlain Group, the owner of garage door opener brands like LiftMaster and Chamberlain, is discouraging customers from using third-party smart home apps with its "myQ" smart garage door openers. The company claims that unauthorized usage of these devices negatively affects the user experience and the performance of its ecosystem. However, the move is also seen as an attempt to promote Chamberlain's own app, which has been receiving negative reviews due to the inclusion of ads and upselling features.

The founder of Home Assistant encourages consumers to avoid companies that treat their customers poorly and to support products that prioritize local functionality.
