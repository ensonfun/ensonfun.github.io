## 5. [Piet: Programming language in which programs look like abstract paintings (2002)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40141777)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article is about a programming language called Piet, named after the artist Piet Mondrian. Programs written in Piet resemble abstract paintings, and the language uses 20 distinct colors. The code is represented by graphics made up of these colors, with individual pixels being significant. The language uses a stack for storage of data values, which are integers. The interpreter begins executing a program in the upper left color block and moves through the blocks following specific rules. Black blocks and the edges of the program restrict program flow, while white blocks allow the interpreter to slide through them without executing commands. The article also mentions the limitations and possible errors that can occur in the language.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an amazing discovery on the examples page of a website. A person named Piet noticed an artwork that reminded him of Piet, the programming language, and decided to execute it. Surprisingly, the program ran successfully. The article suggests that this may be the first time in history that a graphic artist unintentionally created a functioning computer program.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a programming language called Piet, which aims to make programs look like Mondrian paintings. However, the author believes that Piet falls short of achieving this goal unless the developer specifically intends to create a Mondrian-like program. The author expresses a wish for the language structure to be designed in a way that all programs written in Piet would naturally resemble Mondrian's paintings.

## 10. [Zoho is attracting the attention of African startup founders](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40113168)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 Nigerian edtech startup Flexisaf has switched from using Google Workspace to the cheaper alternative, Zoho, as a way to cut costs. Flexisaf had been using Google Workspace since 2010 but found it was becoming too expensive for its growing business. By migrating to Zoho, Flexisaf expects to save around $6,960 a year. Zoho has been making inroads in Africa by hiring local staff, offering payment options in local currencies, and engaging with the tech community. While Zoho has seen some success, experts believe it needs to strengthen its branding and local engagement to compete with larger rivals like Google and Microsoft. Zoho offers a range of software products, including work management tools, customer relationship management, human resource management, and accounting. The company differentiates itself from its competitors by not running ads or selling customer data to third parties. Zoho's user base in Nigeria grew by 50% in 2023, while revenue from South Africa increased by 73%. However, Zoho currently lacks the same level of support for the local developer ecosystem as Google. Zoho's decision to allow African companies to pay for its software in local currencies has contributed to its success in the region, as it avoids regulatory hurdles around dollar spending. In comparison, African companies can only pay for Google Workspace in dollars and euros. Despite Zoho's advantages, it still needs to build trust and engage in strong marketing activities to compete with larger competitors.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is an African based in Uganda who initially wanted to use Google Workplace for their project but later switched to Zoho due to its generous free tier. The author is pleased with Zoho as it provides many built-in tools needed for their project, such as email services like SendGrid, Zepto Mail, MailChimp, Zoho Campaigns, and Zoho Emails. Additionally, Zoho offers other tools like CRMs, making it a comprehensive service for email and communication.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that Zoho, despite being underrated, offers a wide range of capabilities and can serve as a comprehensive solution for small and medium-sized businesses. The article suggests that Zoho is often overlooked due to not being a Bay Area company or creating flashy products, but those who use it appreciate its reliability and functionality.
