## 5. [Creativity fundamentally comes from memorization?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41114825)

**Total comment counts : 56**

### Summary

 The author discusses the relationship between creativity and memorization, arguing that memorization plays a crucial role in fostering creativity. They believe that creativity relies on internalized concepts and patterns, which are acquired through memorization. The author shares their personal experience growing up with Indian and American education systems, highlighting the importance of drilling and memorization in achieving academic success. They assert that memorization is not separate from understanding but rather a form of subconscious pattern recognition. By internalizing heuristics and memorizing knowledge, individuals can free up cognitive resources to focus on higher-level problem-solving and creativity. The author suggests that systems and memorization enable creativity rather than stifle it, as they provide a foundation for exploring novel ideas and violating expectations. They also mention the benefits of their own learning system in quickly acquiring new skills and suggest that becoming autonomous in multiple areas can enhance creativity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article rejects the idea that memorization should be defined as anything that leads to something being retained in memory. The author argues that memorization should refer to the use of language to drill exposure to an abstract representation of a concept, which is not an effective way of absorbing the concept itself. The author believes that experts often fail to understand that learners need meaningful experiences to understand concepts, rather than just drilling vocabulary flashcards. While drilling can be helpful in certain areas, it is only a small part of learning. The author suggests that deliberate practice or "putting in the reps" is a more purposeful and effective approach to learning than traditional memorization techniques.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that rote memorization is not necessary or sufficient for internalizing concepts. It claims that systematic memorization cannot teach taste and is often associated with awkward, tasteless art. Memorization is also said to be ineffective for developing tacit knowledge, especially in creative fields like programming. The author suggests that memorization may be a small component of developing expertise, with realistic practice and mentorship being more important. Additionally, memorization is criticized for its time-consuming and dull nature, which can kill intrinsic motivation for learning. The author advocates for focusing on contextual practice instead of memorization.

## 6. [Rustgo: Calling Rust from Go with near-zero overhead (2017)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41116639)
