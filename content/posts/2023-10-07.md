## 1. [Documented source code for Elite on the NES](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37798914)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses a repository containing the fully documented and annotated source code for Elite on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The code is provided for educational and non-profit purposes and allows users to build the functioning game from the source. The repository includes different variants of the game, and the article provides instructions on browsing and building the code. The NTSC and Imagineer PAL releases have some differences in features and timings. The article also mentions the copyright and licensing considerations of the source code.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the developers of the NES Elite game had to work around the absence of a hardware timer in some early NES consoles. Initially, they used the hardware timer to ensure that in-game physics progressed consistently regardless of variations in frame rate. However, when they submitted the game to Nintendo for approval, they were told that using the hardware timer was not allowed due to compatibility issues with some NES consoles. As a result, the developers had to create their own method of estimating real-time by counting non-maskable interrupts in the game. Looking at the source code on Github, it appears that the developers commented on updating the NMI timer, which they used in place of the hardware timer.

## 7. [The glass at McCormick Place in Chicago is a lethal obstacle for birds](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37800810)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 A significant number of migrating birds died after colliding with glass windows at McCormick Place, the largest convention center in North America. Volunteers are finding bird carcasses within a 1.5-mile radius of the center. The incident, which occurred on October 5th, marked the highest number of bird strikes recorded in a single day by the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors. Approximately 1.5 million birds were in the air over Cook County during that time. Carcasses of various songbird species were recovered, although not every collision results in a visible body. This type of bird mortality typically occurs during peak migration periods, and factors such as weather conditions, light pollution, and the prevalence of glass structures increase the risk. It is estimated that up to one billion birds die annually from collisions. Chicago's light pollution poses a significant threat to migrating birds, and turning off building lights at night can help reduce fatalities. A 2021 study conducted at McCormick Place found that dimming half the lights in large buildings can significantly decrease collisions. McCormick Place participates in the Lights Out Chicago program, which encourages voluntary light reduction. Measures such as incorporating visual markers on windows and implementing bird-friendly designs in buildings can also mitigate bird collisions. While Chicago has approved bird-friendly design regulations, they have yet to take effect. The Bird Safe Buildings Act, signed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker in 2021, requires bird-friendly design in state-owned buildings. Experts suggest investing in retrofits, offering tax credits for environmental initiatives, and implementing bird-friendly policies to address the issue.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a building with a glass lobby that was designed to address issues related to lighting and bird collisions. The glass wall was slanted outward, so if approached from inside, one's feet would make contact before their face. However, the design caused a problem when blind people booked the lobby for a meeting. Their canes did not detect the glass wall, resulting in accidents. As a solution, foot-high barriers were quickly put up to help the blind individuals detect the glass before collision.

## 9. [Could we make C arrays memory safe? Probably not, but let's try](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37788408)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 In this blog post, the author discusses an idea to improve computer security in the C programming language. They propose a system where the programmer would need to provide a formal proof that the index used in array dereferencing operations is valid. The author compares this idea to the borrow checker in Rust, where the programmer needs to prove they are the only one holding an object before mutating it. They suggest using a custom syntax or pragma to define the domain of variables, allowing the compiler to verify the safety of array dereferencing. The author acknowledges that this scheme would not make C a completely memory-safe language, but it could make it somewhat safer. They note that a full implementation of this idea would be complicated.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of array syntax in programming languages and the compatibility of interfaces. It suggests that the array syntax can be made more similar to the C programming language, and mentions that many people have encountered this issue before. It also mentions that selling this idea can be more challenging than implementing it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a situation in which an old Intel 80286 chip can handle memory-safe C arrays. It explains that by running code in '286 protected mode and properly loading the array's base, limit, and other segment descriptors, regular code for array access in assembly or C can ensure memory-safety.
