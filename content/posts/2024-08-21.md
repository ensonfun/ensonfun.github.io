## 1. [The semantic web is now widely adopted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41307011)

**Total comment counts : 60**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of Web 3.0 and how the Semantic Web, which focuses on machine-readable websites, has become widely adopted and can be considered as Web 3.0. The author explains how Semantic Web metadata is added to web pages using JSON-LD, which allows for enhanced link previews and improved search engine results. The article also mentions how csvbase, a website for sharing table data, utilizes the Dataset and CSV on the Web schemas to provide machine-readable information about the tables. The author notes that while it is possible to extract this metadata automatically, there are reasons to provide it explicitly.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the lack of a "killer application" for semantic web standards. The author believes that the digital landscape, dominated by walled gardens and adtech oligopolies, is not conducive to the adoption of semantic web standards. They argue that providing better search metadata is not enough to drive widespread adoption. The lack of adoption can be attributed to both bad luck, with the web getting worse over time, and an incompleteness of vision, with semantic apps lacking the necessary abstractions to appeal to average users. Despite these challenges, the author suggests that the semantic web direction can still contribute to a better web.

## 3. [Nasir Ahmed's digital-compression breakthrough helped make JPEGs/MPEGs possible](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41300071)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 This article discusses the contribution of Nasir Ahmed, an Indian-American engineer, in developing compression algorithms that are essential for the transmission of digital images, videos, and audio files over the internet. Ahmed's work on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) compression algorithm in 1974 revolutionized the way digital files are transmitted, allowing for faster speeds and smaller file sizes. This breakthrough has enabled the development of social media platforms, online music distribution, and video conferencing applications. Ahmed's determination and belief in his work led him to persevere, despite skepticism from others. His career in the STEM field was influenced by his grandfather, an electrical engineer who encouraged him to pursue opportunities in the United States. Ahmed earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in India and later completed his master's and Ph.D. in electrical engineering at the University of New Mexico. In 1966, he joined Honeywell as a principal research engineer, where he first encountered the Walsh functions technique for analyzing digital signals.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that while the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) is an important component of compression, the actual compression comes from a series of side effects. These side effects include packing lower frequency coefficients into the top-left corner of the block, using quantization to eliminate many higher frequency coefficients, clever zig-zag scanning to create long runs of zeroes, RLE (Run Length Encoding) coding of zig-zag scanned blocks, and finally encoding the RLE coded blocks using huffman or arithmetic coding. This process leads to compression, and in the case of intra-frame-only JPEG compression, additional techniques are used in MPEG and other formats for interframe compression.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the development of a practical Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) algorithm by Ahmed and his co-workers at the University of Texas at Arlington in 1973. The co-workers involved in this development are T. Raj Natarajan, Wills Dietrich, Jeremy Fries, and Dr. K. R. Rao. The article suggests giving credit to all the individuals involved in the development of the algorithm.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article offers a cynical take on the concept of "level" in the industry, stating that it is primarily based on a person's ability to convince others of their level. They then propose their own definition of level, which is the marginal contribution of a person's influence on a company's outcome compared to a hypothetical situation where they never worked there, adjusted for a specific risk threshold. In other words, someone at a high level has a significant impact on a company, while someone at a lower level has a smaller impact. They also mention that the positive impact of someone's job can be adjusted for risk tolerance, giving an example of a CEO with a high chance of success but also a chance of failure. They note that risk tolerance may vary depending on the size and maturity of the company.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the differences between software engineering and other forms of engineering. It suggests that mature engineers in general are comfortable working with uncertainty and risk. However, in the software field, there is often a high level of uncertainty and predictability about what is being built. This has led to the rise of Agile development processes, which prioritize iterative and flexible approaches over the traditional Waterfall development process. The article also highlights that in software engineering, the construction process is as intellectual as the design process, whereas in other engineering disciplines, implementation is seen as less intellectual. The author concludes by acknowledging the risks involved in comparing software development to traditional engineering.

 The author discusses how they operate in different mental states, sometimes experiencing depressive episodes and other times just an ebb and flow of energy. They have found that writing things down, especially starting with a specification, has been a helpful tool. They describe how productive days can lead to a well-developed specification, which can then be referred back to on less productive days. They have realized the importance of not relying on memory and always starting with writing.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses strong resonance with the idea of persisting and completing tasks even when they don't want to. They describe their own experience of forcing themselves to work until a task is done, even sacrificing relaxation and waking up early. Although they find this process torturous, they also recognize the therapeutic value in seeing the incompleteness of their original ideas and plans. Through this grind, they have learned to say no to themselves more often and become more disciplined in both work and play. The author acknowledges that they will not grind like this forever, but the experience has taught them to be selective, less impulsive, and better at letting go. Ultimately, they have become someone who finishes things and has a more realistic approach to goal-setting.
