## 8. [PSA: SQLite WAL checksums fail silently and may lose data](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44671373)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 SQLite doesn't perform checksums by default, only utilizing them in Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode. When checksum errors are detected, SQLite drops the frame with the error plus all subsequent frames, even if undamaged, which is intentional behavior. This poses risks of data loss, as seen when a corrupted frame prevents access to older page versions. The author suggests that an error should be raised upon detection of corruption, allowing for recovery options, but notes SQLite's design choices may prioritize stability in embedded systems, like mobile devices, over strict error handling.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The checksums in SQLite's Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) primarily serve to detect partial writes rather than random data corruption. SQLite uses checksums consistently for its journal, whether in rollback or WAL mode. Unlike database writes, which can be idempotent during crashes, it's crucial to differentiate between complete and partial journal entries. A matching checksum indicates a transaction has committed, regardless of the order in which data is physically written to disk.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 SQLite does not include checksums by default, relying instead on lower layers to handle data corruption. Implementing checksums or redundancy would complicate SQLite. The author's viewpoint counters a misunderstanding about SQLite's checksums, asserting they mainly help minimize write barriers and detect incomplete writes, not actual data corruption. The post emphasizes SQLite's predictable behavior and documentation regarding data handling.

## 9. [Use Your Type System](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44671484)

**Total comment counts : 57**

### Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of defining unique types in programming instead of relying on generic types like integers or strings, which can lead to bugs when misused.

The author argues that adopting this technique can significantly reduce mistakes in code and is surprisingly underutilized despite its simplicity and benefits. The article encourages developers to consider custom types for better context and accuracy in their codebases.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author appreciates the concept of making bad states unrepresentable through type systems but warns against developers stopping at basic type implementation. This can lead to confusion with numerous similar types, making the system hard to navigate. The author suggests that in such cases, using weakly or strongly typed dynamic languages like JavaScript or Elixir may be more enjoyable. However, if developers enhance type uses with logic, such as utilizing union types and pattern matching, it can improve the overall experience. An example is provided with the "DewPoint" function, which could accept multiple types seamlessly.

### Top 2 Comment Summary
