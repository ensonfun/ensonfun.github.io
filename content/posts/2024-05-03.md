## 5. [Cardio fitness is a strong, consistent predictor of morbidity and mortality](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40243238)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 This article presents an overview of systematic reviews examining the link between baseline cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and health outcomes in adults. The study included 26 systematic reviews that analyzed data from over 20.9 million observations from 199 cohort studies. The researchers found consistent evidence that high CRF is associated with a lower risk of mortality and incident chronic conditions. Specifically, higher CRF was linked to a reduced risk of all-cause mortality, heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality. However, there are gaps in the literature, particularly with limited evidence among women and certain clinical populations. The study suggests that considering CRF as a clinical vital sign could enhance patient management and risk stratification.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

It can be used with OpenAPI to patch documents, create linting rules, and navigate complex data structures. The syntax and examples of JSONPath expressions are provided. JSONPath is useful for working with OpenAPI documents and can be used to improve their quality by adding extra documentation or contact information. Overall, JSONPath is a handy tool to have when working with OpenAPI.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses using XPath and CSS selectors, along with a library called "espath," to filter and find data in JSON. The approach involves converting the JavaScript object to an XML DOM, running the query using XPath or CSS selectors, and then converting the DOM back to objects. This allows JSON and other JavaScript objects to be searched and filtered using already-standardized methods. The article suggests that there is no need to create a new custom syntax for querying unless CSS and XPath are not desired or there are specific needs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that a useful tool for manipulating JSON using JsonPath syntax is found at jsonata.org. The tool not only allows for simple queries to select matching nodes, but also provides helper functions such as arithmetic, comparisons, sorting, grouping, datetime manipulation, and aggregation. It is written in JavaScript and can be used in Node or in the browser. Additionally, there is a Python wrapper available.

## 8. [The life and times of an Abstract Syntax Tree](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40242224)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses the topic of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in the context of writing compilers. It mentions that ASTs are mainly used to translate input into a more manageable format for compilers. The design of ASTs is important when working on a compiler, and the article explores different approaches. In managed languages like C# or Java, memory management is handled by the runtime, so ownership of AST nodes is not a significant concern. In languages like C++, where memory management is manual, ownership of nodes becomes crucial. The article explains how shared pointers can be used to ensure the validity of nodes in C++. It also briefly mentions Rust's approach to AST representation. Overall, the article highlights the importance of considering ownership and memory management when designing ASTs for compilers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes the author for joking about removing safeguards and then providing an unsafe example. The correct code example uses 'emplace_back' instead of dereferencing 'lhs' on the third line. The article suggests that Rust has safer alternatives like slotmap or typed_arena for achieving the same result. It also mentions that the vector in the code functions as an arena allocator, but this is not explicitly stated in the article. The writer suggests adding clarity and linking to additional resources for proper implementation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses limitations and potential solutions for constructing self-referential data structures, specifically abstract syntax trees (ASTs), in Rust. The borrow-checker in Rust presents challenges for building ASTs due to the requirement of marking nodes with Box<T> or sharing lifetimes. However, these approaches can hinder pattern matching and lead to inconvenience. The author proposes the use of a bump allocator, specifically bumpalo, as a favorable solution. By allocating a large chunk of memory for the AST and tying the lifetime of all nodes to the allocator's handle, it becomes possible to overcome some of the limitations. The drawback is that the entire AST must be freed at once, but this may align with typical usage scenarios. The article provides links for further reading on box patterns and arenas in Rust.

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article describes a locally hosted web application called Stirling PDF that allows users to perform various operations on PDF files. It is a robust tool that can split, merge, convert, reorganize, add images, rotate, and compress PDF files. The application does not make any outbound calls for record-keeping or tracking purposes. All files and PDFs exist on the client side or in server memory during task execution. Users can customize the app using a settings file or environment variables. Stirling PDF also provides a backend API for users to integrate with their own custom scripting. The article includes instructions for installation and usage of the application.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the lack of good open-source tools for signing PDF documents, which are legally important in many parts of the world. Currently, it is challenging to sign PDFs with tools other than Adobe's proprietary software. Even if alternative tools like LibreOffice or poppler are used, obtaining valid certificates can be expensive. The author expresses hope that a provider similar to Let's Encrypt for PDF and S/MIME certificates will emerge, as it would enhance public trust.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author hosts a tool at home that they do not use themselves, but their wife uses it to convert, split, or perform other actions on her PDF files. The author prefers this method over using random websites or apps because the tool uses the same command-line interface (CLI) tools that they use on Linux. The wife does not have a preference and finds the tool to work well for her needs.

## 10. [Georgia Tech, Meta create open dataset to advance solutions for carbon capture](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40243242)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Georgia Tech and Meta have collaborated to create a massive open-source database called OpenDAC, which could help design and implement direct air capture (DAC) technologies more easily and quickly. The database contains reaction data for 8,400 different materials and is powered by nearly 40 million quantum mechanics calculations, making it the largest and most robust dataset of its kind. Using this database, the teams trained an AI model that is significantly faster than existing chemistry simulations. The AI model accurately predicts how metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) will interact with carbon dioxide, making it a powerful tool for material discovery in the field of DAC. The research was published in ACS Central Science.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that carbon capture is primarily used for enhanced oil recovery, rather than its commonly perceived role in reducing carbon emissions. Out of the 27 commercially operational carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects worldwide, 21 of them inject carbon dioxide into oil reservoirs to extract more petroleum. The author suggests that fossil fuel companies rely on subsidies to survive and can benefit from capturing carbon to extract more oil. The article also mentions that Exxon predicts carbon will become as valuable as oil. It references a source stating that global fossil fuel subsidies reached an all-time high of $7 trillion in 2022.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that while carbon capture from the air is an interesting technology, it is only a small part of the solutions needed to address climate change. The author suggests that our focus should be on reducing emissions instead.
