## 1. [Spherical Snake](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46451768)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 Post-game screen showing Score: 0, with "Good game! Play again?" It instructs players to use the arrow keys or on-screen buttons to play and notes that the source code is available on GitHub.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on a spherical snake game prototype, seeking feedback on its core concept, controls, and potential feature additions.
- Concern: Key worries include mobile control responsiveness and accessibility, viewport/zoom issues on mobile browsers, and pacing or balance as the game progresses.
- Perspectives: Opinions vary from enthusiastic praise and curiosity about expanding features to criticisms about controls feeling janky and performance on mobile.

## 2. [Oral microbiome sequencing after taking probiotics](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46518804)

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 The article reviews BioGaia Prodentis, a Swedish DTC oral probiotic containing Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289. It notes BioGaia’s strong clinical background (including NEC prevention data and an FDA Breakthrough designation for IBT-9414) but tests whether Prodentis affects the oral microbiome. Using Plasmidsaurus ONT-based 16S sequencing, the author found no L. reuteri reads after 30 days, suggesting no colonization. Yet the oral microbiome shifted, with a notable rise of Streptococcus salivarius after stopping the probiotic. Conclusion: probiotics may not colonize; microbiome changes can occur unpredictably.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: There is a surprising amount of day-to-day variation in the observed metric.
- Concern: The variation could signal instability and undermine trust in the results.
- Perspectives: Some see the variation as significant and requiring explanation, while others view it as normal fluctuation.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 3. [Vienam bans unskippable ads](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46514677)

**Total comment counts : 68**

### Summary

 Vietnam's Decree No. 342, part of updates to the Advertising Law, takes effect February 15, 2026, tightening online ad rules to protect consumers and curb illegal ads. Key provisions: video and animated ads must be skippable after five seconds; static ads must be cancellable immediately; platforms must offer easy one-click close options and clear reporting tools; false or confusing symbols are banned; users can report and opt out of inappropriate ads. The decree also tightly regulates ads for 11 health-environment categories, including cosmetics, food, milk/formula, insecticides, medical supplies, healthcare, fertilizers, seeds, pharmaceuticals, and alcohol. Directors must remove teen-drinking depictions.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion analyzes consumer experiences with intrusive ad strategies (including unskippable and multi-ad sequences) and the idea of a 5-second skip rule as seen in Vietnam, along with broader thoughts on ad-funded services.
- Concern: The main worry is that aggressive ad tactics and dark patterns degrade user experience and may push users toward paying for ad-free options, potentially harming the viability of free services.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from frustration with ads and support for stricter skip rules to belief that ads are necessary and skepticism about regulation, plus questions about whether ad-funded models can justify their value.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

- Overall sentiment: Cautiously optimistic.

## 7. [Video Game Websites in the early 00s](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46516559)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 Web Design Museum.org invites people to recall early-2000s video game developer and gaming websites and to suggest other old sites, apps, or software for exhibition. Submit names or links via Archive.org. The notice includes copyright statements.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread nostalgically celebrates early 2000s video game fan sites as creative, visually vibrant spaces and laments the current trend toward generic, ad‑driven corporate sites.

- Perspectives: Perspectives range from praising the old, varied fan sites for inspiration and community to lamenting the loss of that creativity in favor of homogenized, monetized platforms, with some noting shifts like Flash's decline and mobile screens. 
- Overall sentiment: Nostalgic with mixed feelings.

## 8. [Stop Doom Scrolling, Start Doom Coding: Build via the terminal from your phone](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46517458)

**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 This DIY guide shows how to code on a smartphone anywhere with internet, using Claude-assisted research to enable “doom coding”—coding via a remote terminal. It recommends Tailscale and Termius to reach a 24/7 computer, and Claude Code for tools, plus starting a local HTTP server accessible via a MagicDNS hostname. Practical steps include installing Tailscale and Termius, noting the computer’s Tailnet address, creating a Termius host, running “python -m http.server 3005,” and using the PostgreSQL app. The post invites updates and contributions.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A discussion about coding on a phone using Claude with remote access ideas (VPN, email interfaces, 24/7 servers) and comparisons to local/mobile coding workflows.
- Concern: The approach risks added complexity, reliability and security concerns, and potential usability issues due to reliance on constant connectivity and remote servers.
- Perspectives: Views range from embracing remote-first methods and new mobile-friendly interfaces to preferring established local solutions like Termux/QPython/tmux, with some hoping for better mobile IDEs or dismissing the idea as impractical.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 9. [Show HN: Mantic.sh – A structural code search engine for AI agents](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46512182)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 Mantic provides a zero-read, deterministic context retrieval infrastructure for AI agents, enabling a structural code search that ranks files in sub-500ms across massive codebases without embeddings, vector databases, or external dependencies. By inferring intent from file structure and metadata rather than reading content, it speeds retrieval beyond human reaction time. It returns JSON with ranked files, confidence scores, and token estimates, and works out of the box with zero configuration for most projects. Licensed AGPL-3.0; commercial inquiries to license@mantic.sh.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on cognitive code search (with or without embeddings) and seeks clarity on Mantic’s pricing, capabilities, MCP status, and documentation.
- Concern: The main worry is opaque or inflated vector DB pricing, plus lack of detailed documentation and potential misrepresentation of Mantic as an MCP tool.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from enthusiasm about trying the tool to skepticism about costs and feature claims, with requests for cost breakdowns and clarification on MCP usage and ignored patterns.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
