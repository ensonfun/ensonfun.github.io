## 1. [You are what you read, even if you don't always remember it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40151952)

**Total comment counts : 73**

### Summary

 The article discusses the idea that the value of books and online content is not necessarily tied to the ability to remember every detail, but rather the impact they have on expanding thinking. The author shares quotes from Dave Rupert and Ralph Waldo Emerson that convey this sentiment. They also mention the importance of being mindful of the content one consumes, as it shapes one's beliefs and perspectives. The article concludes with a story about a professor who emphasizes that education has lasting impact even if specific details are forgotten.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article highlights the idea that our past experiences shape who we are today. It suggests that all the sensory interactions we have had, such as interacting with people, reading books, consuming media, etc., have had an impact on our decisions and ultimately define who we are. The author emphasizes the importance of being mindful while choosing our actions, as we cannot change the influence of our past experiences.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article shares a personal experience about how their thoughts were seemingly influenced by their news feed. They initially thought their phone was listening to their conversations, but upon reflection, they realized that they saw an article headline about pyramids earlier in the day and that influenced their thinking. The author finds it more concerning that their thinking was shaped by their feed rather than their phone listening in on their conversations. This experience reminds them of a graffiti artist in NYC who claimed to "graffiti" people's minds by reading their graffiti.

## 2. [Airlines required to refund passengers for canceled, delayed flights](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40150639)

**Total comment counts : 56**

### Summary

 The Department of Transportation has announced new rules that will require airlines to automatically provide cash refunds to passengers for canceled or significantly delayed flights. The rules apply to both domestic and international flights, and cover tickets purchased from airlines, travel agents, and third-party sites. Refunds must be issued within seven days, in cash, unless the passenger chooses an alternative form of compensation. The Department of Transportation is also working on rules regarding family seating fees, enhanced rights for wheelchair-traveling passengers, and compensation for delayed or canceled flights. The rules were introduced after Southwest Airlines received a record $140 million fine for operational issues during the 2022 holiday travel season. Airlines will have six months to comply with the new rules.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the frustration of the author's acquaintance whose flight was cancelled twice. The airlines only offered a voucher that expires in 3 months and requires the same individuals to travel together. The author criticizes this policy as a way for airlines to retain customers' money.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes the unpleasant and frustrating experiences that people have when traveling by air. It highlights issues such as flight cancellations, delays, lost luggage, and various charges imposed by airlines. The author, who specifically mentions Turkish Airlines, recounts a personal experience of a 2-day delay, staying in a poor hotel and the airport, and the airline's refusal to take responsibility. The article suggests that while there may be some improvements in the industry, there is still a long way to go in terms of customer service. The author speculates that airlines may have taken advantage of the pandemic to provide even poorer service and suggests that flying itself is environmentally damaging. They conclude by mentioning the convenience and lack of hassle in traveling by train within Europe.

## 3. [HTML Attributes vs. DOM Properties](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40152682)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses the differences between attributes and properties in web development. Attributes are serialized in HTML and are case-insensitive, while properties can be any type and are case-sensitive. The article also explains how properties can reflect attributes, but not all attributes have corresponding properties. Properties have validation and defaults, whereas attributes do not. The article concludes by stating that attributes should be used for configuration, while properties can contain state.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of data-attributes in HTML, which provide a middle ground for storing data that can be accessed by JavaScript. The data-attributes are added to HTML elements using the "data-" prefix, such as "data-payload='something'". These attributes can then be accessed in JavaScript using the "dataset" property of the HTML element. However, it is important to note that HTML attributes use kebab-case while JavaScript uses camelCase, so a kebab-case attribute like "data-my-cool-data-attribute='fun'" would be accessed in JavaScript as "dataset.myCoolDataAttribute".

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses behaviors and complexities in web development that do not add any value to people's lives. The author suggests that the specification should have simply defined a DOM object and a JavaScript object as the same thing, with attributes and properties being synonymous.

The author expresses excitement about this development and mentions that they will now prefer using the ESP32 over the ESP8266 for projects involving displays. The article includes links to the LVGL website, ESPHome website, a GitHub pull request, and a discussion on Hacker News.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's preference for the RP2040 (Raspberry Pico processor) over other platforms like ESP8266 and ESP32 for embedded programming. The author outlines reasons for this preference, including the RP2040's superior C SDK, excellent documentation, overclocking capabilities, smart hardware capabilities, high-quality hardware, reasonable cost, dedicated wireless chip, memory-mapped flash, and more GPIOs available. The only disadvantage mentioned is the lack of SPI RAM support, which is present in many ESP32 boards. Despite the familiarity and affordability of ESP platforms, the author suggests starting new projects with the RP2040.

## 5. [TSMC unveils 1.6nm process technology with backside power delivery](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40156275)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has announced its new A16 manufacturing process, which will be its first Angstrom-class production node. The technology's key innovation is its backside power delivery network (BSPDN), known as Super Power Rail. By using gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet transistors and the BSPDN, the 1.6nm-class fabrication process promises to outperform its predecessor, N2P, with a higher clock rate, lower power consumption, and potentially higher transistor density. The introduction of the BSPDN, specifically designed for AI and HPC processors, allows for increased transistor density and improved power delivery. TSMC plans to commence volume production of A16 in the second half of 2026, positioning it to potentially compete with Intel's 14A node in 2027.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 TSMC's latest advance in transistor density appears to be a promising development for the company. Their current density of 197 MTr/mm2 already puts them ahead of Samsung (150 MTr/mm2) and Intel (123 MTr/mm2). With their new 1.6nm process, TSMC is expected to reach a density of around 230 MTr/mm2 by 2026. In comparison, Intel seems to be falling behind in this regard.

### Top 2 Comment Summary
