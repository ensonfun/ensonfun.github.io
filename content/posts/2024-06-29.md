## 1. [The XAES-256-GCM extended-nonce AEAD](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40826683)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article announces the existence of the XAES-256-GCM specification, which is an authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) algorithm. It has 256-bit keys and 192-bit nonces. The algorithm was designed with the goal of enabling safer and more user-friendly APIs for automatically generating fresh nonces. It is compliant and compatible with various settings where alternative large-nonce AEADs are not an option. XAES-256-GCM is an extended-nonce construction on top of AES-256-GCM and can be described using a standard NIST SP 800-108r1 KDF and NIST AES-256-GCM AEAD. The article concludes by stating that XAES-256-GCM is designed to be a safe, compliant, and interoperable AEAD.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a clever design that uses AES-CBC and CMAC to derive keys when lower-level primitives are not available. The design involves several steps, including generating an AES-CBC-256 key, deriving additional keys, and using AES-GCM with the derived keys. The author provides a JavaScript implementation based on the WebCrypto API that supports all CryptoKey features.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a modification to the AES-GCM encryption algorithm to address the issue of nonce collision, which can be exploited by attackers to sign arbitrary messages. The modification involves using two primitives, a counter-based key derivation function (KDF) and the vanilla GCM, to ensure compliance with the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). This modification eliminates the need to rotate keys frequently if a random nonce is used, which is typically recommended.

## 2. [Imhex: A hex editor for reverse engineers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40828493)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article is about ImHex, a hex editor specifically designed for reverse engineers, programmers, and people who work at late hours. ImHex uses a custom programming language called the Pattern Language, which allows users to define structures and data types in a C-like syntax. It also supports format patterns, libraries, magic, and constant files. The article provides information on the system requirements, installation process, and compilation guide for ImHex. It also mentions the option to develop plugins for ImHex using a template project and provides details about the licensing of ImHex.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of using ImHex as a hex editor. The author mentions three reasons why ImHex is the best hex editor they have used. Firstly, it has file templates that automatically highlight sections of known file types. Secondly, ImHex shows how selected bytes can be interpreted as various data types all at once. Lastly, it is significantly faster than other editors when working with large files. The downside mentioned is that the imgui user interface can be buggy at times, but the author still prefers ImHex over other hex viewers like HexFiend and hexa.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is asking if a particular editor has the capability to display ASCII bytes as CP437 glyphs. They prefer reading binary files in this format because it is faster for them to comprehend than hex values. They find that using dots to represent non-printable characters is not very informative.

## 4. [Producing fuels from 1,500 degrees of solar heat](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40786786)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Germany has opened the world's first industrial plant that uses solar heat to produce fuels. The plant, called DAWN, uses mirrors to focus the sun's heat onto a tower, generating high process heat that is used to convert CO2, water, and methane into syngas. The syngas can then be processed into fuels such as kerosene, diesel, and petrol. Synhelion, the developer of the technology, plans to produce greener fuel for transportation and low-carbon cement. The company aims to scale up production to 1,000 t/y by 2025 and eventually reach 1 million t/y by 2033 while producing fuels at around $1/liter. The plant was built in Jülich, Germany, in collaboration with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and Aachen University's solar institute. Partners in the project include Lufthansa and Swiss Airlines, with potential customers for the fuel. Synhelion is also working with Cemex to explore using the technology for low carbon heat in cement production.

 David Doty, a respected figure in nuclear magnetic resonance, focused on finding a solution to an impending energy crisis. He explored the Fischer-Tropsch process as a way to convert excess renewable energy into an energy-dense liquid fuel. Despite his meticulous efforts to improve the fuel synthesis process, the economics remained unfavorable. Doty's work has been recognized through patents and presentations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the efficiency of a fuel production installation, which claims to produce several thousand liters of fuel annually. However, the author argues that the production rate seems low compared to the size of the installation. They note that a liter of gasoline is equivalent to 10KWh of energy, and if the installation receives five hours of full sunlight per day, it would only produce 2KW of energy, which is similar to the output of five standard solar panels. As a result, the author questions whether the installation is inefficient or if they have miscalculated.

## 10. [The 'pay phone bandit' who baffled the FBI in the '80s](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40827650)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article focuses on the story of a notorious safecracker known as the "pay phone bandit" or "telephone bandit" who operated in the 1980s. Standing at approximately 5 feet 9 inches tall, the man with a ponytail would pay for his food or his room with rolls of quarters, which he obtained through breaching pay phones and collecting the money stored within. He meticulously targeted pay phones located in various states, using specialized locksmith tools to pick the locks and remove the coin receptacle without raising suspicion. By the time the missing money was discovered, the bandit would have moved on to a different location. Despite extensive efforts by law enforcement, the pay phone bandit remained elusive, earning him the reputation of being a smart and organized criminal.
