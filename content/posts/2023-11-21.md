## 4. [Charging a lithium battery to 80% only?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38317893)

**Total comment counts : 45**

### Summary

 The article discusses the practice of optimizing battery life by charging only up to 80% capacity. The author argues that while this may reduce the amount of energy available in a single charge, it significantly extends the battery's overall lifespan. They provide a graph showing that charging to 80% instead of 100% can multiply the amount of energy transferred over the battery's life by a factor of four. The author also mentions that in satellites, batteries are often designed to charge and discharge between a third and two-thirds of their capacity to maximize their lifetime. They conclude by advising users to charge their batteries as often as possible but as little as necessary, typically staying within the range of 30% to 80% capacity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author suggests labeling smartphone battery indicators to show a full charge at 80% and allowing users to overcharge up to 125% to make them aware of the negative effects of overcharging. However, the author believes this is unlikely to happen due to reduced battery life being a driver for phone upgrades.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article has stopped trying to manage the battery life of their devices because they have found that most devices have high power drain even when not in use. They mention that regardless of the operating system, devices such as laptops, tablets, and game consoles lose a significant amount of battery charge over a short period of time. As a result, the author decides to keep their devices plugged in when not in use, disregarding the idea of preserving battery longevity.

**Total comment counts : 41**

### Summary

 Blazor is a framework that allows .NET developers to build interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. It started as an experimental project in 2018 and has evolved to include Blazor WebAssembly (Blazor WASM) and Blazor Server. Blazor WASM allows the .NET runtime to execute on the client, but it has been criticized for its initial load time, performance compared to JavaScript frameworks, compatibility issues, SEO challenges, and complexities of interoperability with JavaScript. Blazor Server, on the other hand, maintains the client-side UI on the server using a SignalR connection, which addresses some of the criticisms of Blazor WASM but introduces downsides such as latency and scalability issues.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that Blazor, a web development framework, is well-suited for enterprise Line of Business (LOB) apps. It highlights the relief of .NET developers who no longer need to use JavaScript and can work comfortably within the .NET ecosystem. Blazor is also suitable for CMS, blogs, content mills, small web apps, portfolio sites, and more, thanks to its support for Server-Side Rendering (SSR). The author, who has developed a complex web app, praises the ability to use C# models directly in web app markup code through Razor components. This eliminates the need to translate domain models into JSON models and vice versa, reducing cognitive overhead.

## 6. [Why did base64 win against uuencode?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38343748)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses the differences between uuencode and Base64 encoding formats for 8-bit data. It mentions that uuencode was more popular for a time due to its robustness and user-friendliness, but eventually lost to Base64. The main reason for Base64's popularity is its support by MIME, a binary encoding standard. Uuencode had issues with mail software and gateways, as well as compatibility with different character sets. Base64 is slightly more compact and does not require a character indicating line length. Some reasons why Base64 was disliked include the lack of file name and mode storage, and the difficulty of acquiring a base64 decoder. Base64 solved these problems and was favored for use within MIME. The decline of terminal-mode access and the rise of GUI and web browsers also contributed to uuencode's decline. Overall, Base64 became the preferred format for encoding 8-bit data.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that uuencode lost popularity to Base64 because uuencode used spaces in its encoding and Internet protocols at the time often caused spaces to be corrupted. This required manual fixing of corrupted uuencode files. In contrast, Base64 was designed to withstand whitespace corruption and be compatible with non-ASCII character sets. As a result, Base64 became widely used, especially in MIME.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article reflects on their personal experience with the transition from UUENCODE format to base64 encoding. They discuss the reasons why they started using base64, including its widespread availability and the availability of decoding packages. They also mention that during this period, other line encoding methods such as uux and shar were also used. The author notes that efficiency and denser encoding were selling points for base64. They mention several individuals who worked on baseXX encoding and the discussions that took place on the topic. The article also briefly mentions Mike Lesk, the creator of UU*, who was less involved in the discussions surrounding line encoding.
