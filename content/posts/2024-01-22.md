### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author shares their experience transferring the contents of their Atari 8-bit disks to their PC in the late 90s or early 2000s. They did not have the skills to build a cable called SIO2PC, so they wrote a Basic program on the Atari to read sector data and display it on the screen. They connected the Atari to their PC's TV card and used a Delphi program to capture screenshots and decode the data. They added a mask pattern, checksum, and sector address to improve the process. The author considers this their greatest engineering achievement. They later went on to build an SIO2PC program called AspeQt, which has become popular in the Atari community.

The error correction is generated using mathematical algorithms. The article does not specify the exact placement of error correction within the QR code, but it states that understanding the math behind error correction is not necessary for manual reading of the code as long as it is undamaged.

## 3. [GPT-3.5 crashes when it thinks about useRalativeImagePath too much](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39086106)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 The author discovered that adding certain phrases, such as "pony pane pony pane pony pane," at the beginning of a response consistently resulted in an error message when using ChatGPT 3.5. They also found that using the API for GPT-3.5 produced the same error message. This issue was observed when using variations of the phrases as well. The article explains that GPT models generate multi-character "tokens" instead of individual letters, which improves performance and accuracy. One particular token, "useRalativeImagePath," was found to have a misspelling and appeared frequently in XML configuration files for a testing software called Katalon Studio. However, the token was not trained on extensively, resulting in the model outputting something that isn't a valid token. This information could potentially be used to disrupt attempts to summarize text with GPT-3.5. The author concludes by mentioning that they used other blog posts for research on the topic.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the occurrence of glitch tokens in language models like GPT-XX. It explains that glitch tokens occur when a common word or token is present in the original dataset used for training but is later removed before training the model. This lack of knowledge about the semantics of the token can result in buggy or disturbing outputs. The article gives the example of usernames from a specific subreddit as a common occurrence of glitch tokens. OpenAI has fixed most of these glitches for their hosted models.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 During World War II in the Netherlands, people used the word "Scheveningen" as a test to identify if someone was Dutch or German. Today, users can ask random strangers on the internet to spell certain glitch tokens to determine if they are interacting with an LLM bot.

When contacting, it is important to provide the IP address and Reddit account.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that refusing to fly on a Boeing 737 Max could send a clear signal to airlines to adapt. Even a slight decrease in ticket sales for the 737 could impact its profitability, potentially causing airlines to make changes. Airbus is already outselling Boeing, and with a lead time of 5-10 years, they could expand production to further compete if demanded by airlines.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses interest in an idea, but is concerned that airlines have the ability to change the plane at the last minute before a flight. This creates a dilemma for passengers who have already gone through the process of getting to the airport and waiting at the gate.

## 8. [Launch HN: Diversion (YC S22) – Cloud-Native Git Alternative](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39088551)

**Total comment counts : 71**

### Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of Git as a version control system and the need for a new VCS. It mentions that Git's scalability and complexity are major drawbacks and that Google and Meta have built their own VCS systems to address these issues. Additionally, other large companies in industries like games development, semiconductors, and financial services still use legacy tools like SVN and Perforce due to Git's limitations. The article proposes creating a new VCS called Diversion that aims to be easy-to-use, fast, and scalable while retaining Git's branching capabilities. It also highlights the benefits of real-time collaboration in modern cloud tools and mentions that Diversion is compatible with Git and can synchronize with existing Git repositories. The article concludes by stating that Diversion is currently in open beta and outlines planned improvements.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a new cloud-native alternative to Git. The author questions the relevance of the cloud-native aspect and expresses skepticism about the scalability issues of Git. They also question the significance of the underlying protocols for the average user. The alternative, called Diversion, is built on distributed storage and databases, accessible through a REST API, and runs on serverless cloud infrastructure. The desktop client synchronizes work in progress to the cloud in real-time.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of version control systems (VCSs) operating on Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) instead of plaintext lines. The author suggests that it should be possible to collaborate on a shared codebase without all contributors needing to follow the same formatting rules, naming conventions, or even use the same programming language. By transpiling to and from an agreed-upon shared AST target, collaborators could work with their own preferred styles and still contribute to the codebase. The article argues that since code is a representation of a tree structure, following strict formatting rules and storing violations against the style near the code would allow for flexibility in coding conventions and languages.
