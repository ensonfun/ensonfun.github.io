Overall, the dataset offers intriguing insights into musical composition and genre characteristics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article critiques the use of absolute chord analysis over relative chord analysis (Roman numeral analysis) in music datasets, highlighting the importance of song structure and repeating chords. It argues that determining the most common key and related chords would provide more valuable insights, especially for genres like country and jazz. The author emphasizes that many songwriters don't make data-driven decisions about chord structures and that the notion of 7th chords being exclusive to jazz is misleading. Overall, the analysis lacks depth due to a superficial understanding of music theory.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The analysis based on the original dataset is flawed due to its construction, which omits repeated chords that are essential to understanding musical forms, such as blues progressions. This simplification makes it difficult to grasp the underlying harmony of songs. Additionally, analyzing songs should focus on the relationships between chords rather than the chords themselves. A more effective approach would be converting the chords to Roman numerals to reveal common construction patterns.

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 Google's AMP for email aims to modernize the email experience by allowing users to take actions like booking flights directly from their inbox. This follows Google's previous implementation of AMP for mobile web pages, which gained begrudging adoption due to benefits such as faster load times and better search ranking. However, developers have criticized AMP for its potential threat to open web principles, as it divides mobile and desktop experiences and reduces site control. Despite these concerns, Google persists in pushing AMP into email, promoting interactive features while facing skepticism from the web community.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author criticizes the practice of sending emails that merely link to external content, as emails should be self-contained and immutable records. They emphasize the importance of being able to reference an email later without concerns about changes or access issues. The shift towards linking instead of attaching documents allows companies to control information, diminishing the reliability of receiving important records, such as invoices, in email form.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author agrees with the article's conclusion but distinguishes between political objections to AMP and its technical merits.

## 6. [The Size of Packets](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43723884)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses the optimal size of packets in packet-switched networks, essential for digital communications. Currently, Internet packets range from 20 to 1,500 octets to avoid fragmentation and header truncation issues. Historically, RFC 791 set a maximum of 576 octets unless conditions were met for larger sizes. The evolution of Ethernet, developed in the 1970s for local area networks, emphasized decentralized design and efficient packet sizes. It balances the need for data timing integrity and network efficiency, influencing the design of packet sizes to minimize the risk of undetected collisions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recounts a significant bug encountered while developing a component to relay market data to a trading system for a major U.S. exchange. Despite performance tests showing successful results, latency unexpectedly deteriorated due to the addition of a single market to a data list. This small change caused the market data message to exceed Ethernet frame limits, resulting in fragmentation that slowed data transmission. Ultimately, short-term fixes were implemented to reduce message size, although the long-term solution remains unclear.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 MTU discovery could be simplified by implementing a default behavior of truncating and forwarding oversized packets. This would enable endpoints to compare received bytes against the packet's encoded size to identify truncation and determine the inbound MTU size. It facilitates endpoint protocol MTU discovery, ensuring authentication benefits and allowing precise measurement of MTU size with a single large probe packet. Additionally, this approach would help quickly identify MTU reductions from route changes, preventing packet loss or responses from unauthenticated sources.

 Objective-C allows for C function calls to perform similar tasks, meaning you can develop an entire iOS app in pure C. While using Objective-C syntax enhances usability, SDL provides a convenient C-based wrapper for simple games, enabling cross-platform compatibility without Objective-C. Additionally, Apple offers some C interfaces like CoreFoundation to minimize direct interaction with Objective-C, but UIKit, essential for all iOS apps, requires some Objective-C usage.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Many developers opt for a common codebase for cross-platform development, particularly in video games, where using C++ is prevalent. Game engines like Unreal and Unity utilize C/C++ with minimal integration layers for different platforms. While some might use web apps in Electron (also built in C++), the prevailing trend is to stick with native languages like Java for Android and Swift for iOS due to ease of access to tutorials and resources. There's a call for more open-source solutions to prevent vendor lock-in in the development community.
