### Summary

 Modvion has developed a modular system for transporting wind turbine towers, which can exceed 100 meters in height. This approach uses engineered wood, making towers lighter, cost-effective, and efficient without requiring expensive reinforcements. The wooden towers are carbon-negative, reducing overall emissions by about 25% compared to traditional steel and concrete towers. Collaborations with companies like Enel Green Power, Vattenfall, and Vestas aim to integrate these innovative wooden towers into the renewable energy market, enhancing sustainability in wind power.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that concerns about the lifecycle emissions of wind turbines are overstated, suggesting they stem from oil company propaganda. It cites a study showing that wind turbines offset their emissions after just 5.3 months of operation, considering all aspects from creation to disposal. This indicates that wind power can be effectively net-zero in a short timeframe, disputing claims that suggest it poses a significant environmental problem.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Steel offers high strength per volume, making it a standard choice for wind turbine towers. However, since these towers are hollow, increasing wall thickness is feasible. Modvion towers utilize Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL), which provides better strength per weight and cost compared to steel. This trade-off between strength per volume and strength per weight could allow for taller turbine towers.

Ultimately, the Bellmac-32 marked progress, as the VAX line became obsolete due to its slow adoption of new technologies.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the unique behavior of the 'ASL' (arithmetic shift left) instruction found in a specific instruction set manual. Unlike most ISAs, which do not differentiate between arithmetic and logical left shifts, the ASL instruction preserves the sign bit while shifting the other bits. The author notes that in the M68K architecture, the distinction between 'ASL' and 'LSL' lies in their handling of the Overflow flag, with 'ASL' setting it if any shifted bits differ from the sign bit, while 'LSL' clears it.
