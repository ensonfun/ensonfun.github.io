**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 The article discusses how the human eye perceives color through three types of cone cells sensitive to different light wavelengths. It highlights a study by Fong et al. (2025) that uses laser stimulation to activate only M cones, allowing subjects to perceive a unique blue-green color. An optical illusion animation is referenced, which demonstrates how manipulating visual stimuli can create intense color perceptions. It notes the limitations of traditional color representation in technology and suggests that experiments might broaden the spectrum of colors we can experience. However, conclusions are limited due to the lack of detailed subject reports.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Evolution led to overlapping sensitivities in cone photoreceptors, with M cones peaking at 535 nm and L cones at 560 nm. Most mammals have two types of cones due to a loss of full color vision in the age of dinosaurs, while primates developed a third cone for trichromatic vision, linked to fruit-baring habitats. Notably, Old and New World primates evolved this cone independently, with Old World primates experiencing gene duplication on the X chromosome, while New World primates have a polymorphic opsin gene, resulting in varying color vision capabilities among sexes.
