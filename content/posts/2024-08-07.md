## 3. [East Germany invented 'unbreakable' drinking glasses](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41173177)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 Superfest, an "unbreakable" drinking glass invented in East Germany, is making a comeback. The glass was designed to be more durable than ordinary drinking glasses, lasting up to ten times longer. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the company that produced Superfest glasses went bankrupt. Now, with a growing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly products, the glasses are being sold for around â‚¬35 each on online marketplaces. The anonymity of the original designers was politically desired in East Germany, where the collective was valued over individual talent. The glass was made using innovative technology that increased the toughness of the glass surface. Its decline in popularity was due to its functionalist design and its strength, which threatened glass retailers' profits. However, a Berlin startup is trying to reintroduce the highly durable glasses to the market, capitalizing on the rising demand for sustainable products.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the surprising thinness and lightness of these glasses, comparing them to modern wine glasses. The author also mentions that they have never accidentally broken one.

**Total comment counts : 70**

### Summary

 Social media giant X has confirmed plans to shut down its San Francisco headquarters and relocate its employees to the South Bay. CEO Linda Yaccarino announced the closure in an internal email, stating that the move is the right decision for the company in the long term. X's engineering workers will share an office in Palo Alto with another company owned by Elon Musk, while the remaining employees will be routed to existing offices in San Jose's Santana Row. The company's headquarters in San Francisco had been largely vacant after multiple rounds of layoffs, and the space is now being marketed for sublease. X is obligated for about 800,000 square feet of office space in Mid-Market until 2026 and 2028. The closure marks the end of an era for the neighborhood, which attracted tech companies through a tax break program initiated by the city in 2011. The tax break, which Twitter took advantage of, aimed to make the area more appealing to businesses. However, since the expiration of the tax breaks in 2019 and the rise of remote work, the neighborhood has faced challenges. X's relocation is another blow to the area.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article is about a person's experience with flooding in their parents' house on a mountainside. Initially, the basement would flood from the bottom due to rainwater pressure pushing up through the thin clay soil and bedrock. To solve this issue, the parents had french drains installed around the house and in front of it, directing the water away. This stopped the flooding and allowed them to finish the basement. However, years later, after the father passed away, the flooding started again due to a failure in the french drains. The drains had to be dug up, replaced, and redone to fix the issue.

## 10. [How Uber tests payments in production](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41178959)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of testing in production and why it is necessary, using Uber's payment system as an example. The author argues that traditional staging environments are not as effective as testing in the actual production environment. They explain that software, unlike physical machines, can improve over time, and legacy software should be maintained to continue functioning properly. The author also highlights the importance of continually fixing bugs and testing payment systems in a sandbox environment before moving to production. Ultimately, the article suggests that testing in production is a great idea and shares insights from the author's experience as a payments engineer.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of testing APIs for payment systems in the industry. The author explains that many companies rely on real cards and real API endpoints to test payments because testing APIs provided by payment providers are often of low quality. The author also notes that using testing endpoints can introduce unique bugs that are not found in the production environment, leading many teams to avoid using them altogether. It is common practice to only use testing endpoints in the early stages of development and then switch to production endpoints before the product launch. The author suspects that the situation may be different in the US, where testing environments for payment providers may simulate a typical domestic US scenario.
