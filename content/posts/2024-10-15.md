## 2. [The Physics of Magic Windows (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41842775)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses the creation of a unique transparent acrylic object that can project images and 3D holograms when light shines on it. This phenomenon is due to "caustics," which are bright patches formed by the refraction of light through transparent materials. The author explains that by skillfully manipulating the surface of the acrylic to have specific variations in height (concavity and convexity), they were able to focus light and create recognizable images.

The process involves key mathematical concepts. A traditional convex lens serves as a basic analogy, where the concentration of light creates a bright spot. The brightness at different points is linked to the surface's curvature and the angles of light incidence, governed by Snell's law. 

The article outlines a method to design the acrylic slab by:
1. Adjusting the "pixels" of the lens surface to correspond with the brightness of an image.
2. Using geometry to determine angles and surface normals.
3. Integrating these normals to create a continuous heightmap of the lens surface.

The author emphasizes that adjusting the lens surface requires iterative methods for proper continuity and accuracy. The resulting object, termed the "Magic Window," exemplifies how slight surface variations can effectively manipulate light, akin to how a lens operates.
