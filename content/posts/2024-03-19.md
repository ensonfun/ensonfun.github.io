**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The author reflects on the 20th anniversary of their blog, which was started during a time when blogging about fundamental physics was popular. However, most of the other blogs from that time have become dormant, with a few physicists, like Sabine Hossenfelder and Sean Carroll, transitioning to video content. The author expresses their confusion about discussing complex theoretical physics topics on Twitter, which they believe is flooded with random stupidity. The author believes that their writings from 20 years ago have held up well, despite some changes in their viewpoint. They mention that the failure to let go of speculative ideas has harmed the field of fundamental theory, and the difficulty in reaching higher energy scales makes it unlikely they will witness significant new data in their lifetime. The author criticizes the lack of progress in the subject for almost 50 years and expresses their elitist belief that only individuals with exceptional talent and proper training can make significant advancements in difficult problems. The author reflects on their experience as a student at elite institutions and believes that 40 years of training students in a failed research program have had a negative impact on the field. The author discusses incidents that contributed to their loss of faith in the institutions, including a program and a publicity stunt that they found disturbing. Despite the depressing state of the wider world and the subject they care about, the author states that their personal circumstances are going well and they remain optimistic.
