## 1. [Isometric Projection in Game Development](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41195823)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses the theory behind isometric projection in game development. It explains the different types of projections used, such as orthographic projection and perspective projection. The focus is on isometric projection, which is a method for visualizing 3D objects in two dimensions by making the angles between the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis equal 120 degrees. The article also mentions that most retro isometric games are not true 3D games but instead use 2D tiles positioned to create a 3D effect.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recollects the challenges they encountered while developing an isometric engine for a video game in the 90s. They struggled to determine the cursor's position, which required converting screen coordinates to tile positions and accounting for the height of the tile stack and transparency. The author remarks that this problem could now be easily solved using Google. The game's 2D tiles were created in 3D Studio Max, and the characters were exported as meshes from the same software. The article includes a link to a YouTube video for reference.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a 2D isometric tactical strategy game called Cantata. It is described as a 4X version of smaller tactics games like Advance Wars, featuring elements such as supply lines, region capture, and unique units. The game is isometric and uses pixel art. The author refers to a helpful article on isometric math and mentions the development of a custom renderer for the game that supports various tile-layering steps based on factors like units and terrain types. The art assets are based on 64x64 size tiles.

## 2. [Blitz: A lightweight, modular, extensible web renderer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41221252)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses Blitz, a high-performance HTML and CSS renderer built for the "Dioxus Native" project. Blitz is a lightweight webview with a native Rust API, allowing it to work with Rust reactivity and state management libraries like Dioxus. It does not support browser features such as webrtc, websockets, bluetooth, or localstorage, as these functionalities can be fulfilled using regular Rust crates. Blitz is currently in an experimental stage and is not recommended for building apps yet. It is licensed under both the Apache 2.0 and MIT licenses.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that the web development tool Blitz is not yet ready for use. It lists several issues including basic text input, lack of support for scrolling and complex CSS selectors, incomplete event handling integration, inefficient networking, lack of attention to performance and memory leaks, and missing features such as shadows, web fonts, and form controls. The article mentions that these issues are due to the complexity of building a webview and that the developers hope to have a more complete version available in 2-3 months.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a project called Flying Saucer, which was created 20 years ago as a Java-based HTML and CSS2 renderer. The author initially intended for it to be used for rendering rich text user interfaces in games, but it ended up being mostly used for server-side PDF generation. The project is still being updated and has a page on Wikipedia as well as a GitHub repository. The author expresses excitement about seeing more graphical user interface libraries in the Rust programming language.

## 3. [How to avoid losing items? Holding pens](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41220059)

**Total comment counts : 74**

### Summary

 The article discusses the common problem of losing things within our homes. It mentions that when we are interrupted or under pressure, we make quick decisions about where to place items, but often forget later. The author suggests the solution of having assigned places for each item, but acknowledges that this may not work for all things. They propose the concept of "holding pens," designated areas in every room to temporarily store items that do not have a specific assigned place. The article is written by Alex Wendland, who provides their Twitter handle, GitHub, and LinkedIn information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author suggests a practical approach to organizing and moving items within a home. They propose having separate "take-off" points, located near the entrance or exit of each room. For instance, if someone needs to transport items from their home office to the living room and kitchen, they would queue the items at the respective take-off points. When they have a break, they would pick up the items and drop off the living-room items on their way to the kitchen, and vice versa when returning. By consistently checking these take-off points, everything is usually in the right place, or the author knows where to find it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes how the author developed a strategy to prevent forgetting essential items when leaving the house. Inspired by the concept of poka-yoke trays used in manufacturing, the author created their own version using a plastic tray and craft foam. They designated spots for each item they needed, such as keys, wallet, and badge, and made it a rule to not leave until the tray was completely full. This system helped the author eliminate the frustration of searching for misplaced items and improved their morning routine.

## 5. [Apple's requirements are about to hit creators and fans on Patreon](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41224853)

**Total comment counts : 78**

### Summary

 Starting from November 2024, Patreon is required by Apple to switch to their in-app purchase system for all iOS transactions or risk being removed from the App Store. This change will only affect new memberships purchased in the iOS app, not existing members. To offset Apple's 30% App Store fee, Patreon has built an optional tool that automatically increases prices in the iOS app. However, creators can also choose to keep their prices the same and pay the fee from their earnings. It is important to note that the fees and pricing changes only apply to the iOS app, while the web and Android platforms remain unaffected. Creators will need to migrate to the subscription billing model by November 2025 to ensure availability on the iOS app, as Apple's mandates do not support other billing models. Patreon is working on a 16-month migration process to support creators through this change and provide new features and tools. Ultimately, creators have the agency to decide how to apply the fee, and the decision can be changed at any time.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that Apple's fees on Patreon subscriptions in its app are now higher than Patreon's own fees. It argues that the concept of fairness does not exist in the market, only competition. The article questions whether Apple hosting the Patreon app on iOS provides more value than the existence of Patreon itself. The author suggests that charging higher fees per transaction than the platforms being hosted indicates a lack of control.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a recent update from Patreon, a platform for creators to receive financial support from their fans. The author, a longtime YouTube creator who relies on Patreon, expresses frustration with the news that all creators must switch from a per-creation payment schedule to a monthly subscription model. The author believes that the per-creation model allows for flexibility and fairness towards supporters. The author plans to push back against this change and may consider exploring other platforms or finding alternative solutions if the update proceeds as planned.

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 Simon Westbrook, a former Pfizer employee, decided to start his own biotech company after being made redundant. Despite facing financial struggles and attending conferences to attract investors, Westbrook persisted in developing a drug to treat osteoarthritis. After a 14-year mission, Westbrook received news that his medication, LEVI-04, had exceeded expectations. The drug, based on a molecule discovered while working at Pfizer, can be delivered via a monthly injection and has shown significant reduction in pain, increased mobility, and better mental health for osteoarthritis sufferers. Westbrook believes LEVI-04 could be one of the most important drugs ever and hopes it can also be used to treat other conditions in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a study that investigated the potential of soluble neurotrophin receptors in modulating pain in osteoarthritis (OA). The study found a positive correlation between pain and Î²-NGF, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as a negative correlation with proNGF. Soluble LNGFR positively correlated with pain, while soluble TrkA did not. These findings suggest that soluble LNGFR could be a potential therapeutic target for managing OA pain. The study recommends further research in this area.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes an entrepreneur who used his savings to start a drug startup company. Contrary to a misleading mention of "beating arthritis," the entrepreneur does not have arthritis. He came up with the idea for the startup around the time he was laid off by Pfizer.
