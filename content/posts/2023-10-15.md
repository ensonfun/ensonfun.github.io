They also touch on the potential network effect of this data, where seeing what friends or trusted groups find interesting could be valuable. The author expresses curiosity about hearing others' thoughts on the topic.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that there are no session managers that can compete with Session Buddy. Tab Session Manager causes high CPU usage and does not display currently open incognito windows and tabs. Sessionic opens tabs in new normal windows instead of incognito. In contrast, Session Buddy offers a full page overview of currently open windows and their tabs, and when a tab is clicked, it takes the user to that tab in the corresponding window. If a tab from a previously saved session is clicked, it opens in an incognito window. Consequently, Session Buddy seems to be the only session manager with these features.
