**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of treemaps as a visualization tool for exploring and summarizing hierarchical and heterogeneous data. Treemaps are described as a space-filling visualization that can be used to represent data in a way that uses all available pixels. The article explains the process of constructing a treemap and suggests various techniques for improving the representation of data, such as using colors to indicate data types, adding spacing to show grouping, and drawing lines between parent and child elements. The article also compares treemaps to other visualization options, such as pprint, data browsers, and schemas. Suggestions for further improvements in treemap design and functionality are also provided.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a codebase visualization tool called Code Atlas that uses Voronoi treemaps, which have a non-rectangular layout. The tool allows users to navigate the map by zooming through double-clicks, as smaller cells in deep codebases can be challenging to target accurately with a cursor. It also mentions that Code Atlas is available as a Github Action for generating treemaps during CI.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their dislike for tree maps as they find it difficult to see the intended tree structure. Although some tree maps may be visually appealing, this is true for most visualizations. The author especially dislikes when tree maps are used to represent the logical connection of something like a CPU, as it does not accurately depict the connection. They also criticize the use of a combination of tree and heat maps, as they believe it fails to provide any useful information that a simple ordered list couldn't convey.

## 7. [Unpacking Google’s Web Environment Integrity specification](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36875940)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 The article discusses a new proposal by Google called the Web Environment Integrity spec, which Vivaldi browser believes poses a major threat to the open web. The spec aims to provide websites with an API that determines whether the browser and platform being used are trusted by an authoritative third party. Google's involvement in this raises concerns about impartiality, as it could potentially favor its own platforms. Furthermore, there are questions about how the spec will ensure that real people are interacting with websites and what restrictions it may impose on extensions and browser modifications. The article warns that if implemented, this spec could harm the open web and negatively impact smaller vendors. It calls for vigilance, legislation, and reducing Google's market share to maintain an even playing field and protect the openness of the web.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes Google's "safetynet" feature for Android, arguing that it does not increase security as claimed. The feature locks out third-party up-to-date and secure ROMs, while allowing insecure manufacturer-provided ROMs to pass, causing a vendor lock-in. This prevents advanced users from improving their security without purchasing additional hardware. The author calls for more attention to be given to this issue to counter the claim that this kind of attestation benefits users.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the question of whether a browser can refuse to implement a contentious feature. It states that in this particular case, it is not that simple, as browsers that choose not to implement the feature would not be trusted and websites using the feature could reject users from those browsers. The article also mentions that Google has ways to drive adoption of these features by websites. It emphasizes that as a software creator, it is up to you to decide what is best for your customers, and if the only hope of not implementing the feature is relying on the EU to take action against Google, it suggests a lack of willingness to take a strong stance independently.

## 9. [Google vs. the Open Web](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36875164)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The article discusses Google's proposed "Web Environment Integrity" (WEI), which would allow websites to select which devices (browsers) they are displayed on and refuse service to others. The author argues that this proposal goes against the principles of the open web and is primarily a solution to Google's advertising problem. The author also raises concerns about the exclusion of marginalized groups and the potential for abuse by websites. They argue that this proposal would turn the web into an appliance and undermine its generative nature. The article mentions reactions from the community, including opposition from Mozilla. The author concludes by pointing out the need for both short-term technological considerations and long-term regulation to protect marginalized groups and preserve the open web.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the ease of excluding bots, which can usually be identified by their user agent string. While it is possible for bots to fake this string, it is unlikely that they generate such a significant number of impressions for Google to take action against them. The author questions the seriousness of the situation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that instead of expressing frustration towards a particular corporation, it might be more effective to write to competition authorities to address the potential negative impacts on competition caused by a proposal.

## 10. [Expo – Open-source platform for making universal apps for Android, iOS, and web](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36871651)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 The article is about Expo, an open-source platform for creating universal native apps using React. Expo supports Android, iOS, and web platforms, allowing developers to build apps with React and JavaScript. The article mentions Expo Application Services (EAS), a platform that provides hosted services integrated with Expo open-source tools. It also provides links to the Expo Community Guidelines, official documentation, contributing guide, frequently asked questions, and information about the Expo team members. The Expo source code is available under the MIT license.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author used to maintain Detox for iOS when they were at Wix from 2017 to 2021. They explain that they dropped support for Expo for technical and "political" reasons. They found that users who reported issues with their Expo apps often had little technical understanding of the complex environment stack. The Expo layer added complexity and bugs, and users had limited ability to fix anything without ejecting their project from the Expo ecosystem. The React Native layer also had bugs. When users reported bugs to the Expo team, they received unhelpful comments and often saw no reaction. Ultimately, the author and their team decided that the hassle was not worth the low-quality user benefit and chose to drop support for Expo.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with cross-platform frameworks for mobile development. They conclude that these frameworks are usually a bad idea because the user experience is inferior to native apps and there are compromises to achieve cross-platform functionality. The author suggests two alternatives: creating a progressive web app for cross-platform compatibility or using native UI with shared business logic using languages like Rust, Go, or Kotlin Multiplatform. They mention that native UI has improved and are comparable to web development tools like React.
