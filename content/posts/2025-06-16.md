## 6. [Is gravity just entropy rising? Long-shot idea gets another look](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44285874)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 Isaac Newton was never satisfied with his law of universal gravitation, prompting him to explore mechanical models of gravity. Albert Einstein later explained gravity as a distortion of space-time through general relativity, which also presents unresolved issues. Recently, physicist Daniel Carney's "entropic gravity" model suggests gravity results from thermal interactions among unseen particles, echoing earlier mechanical ideas. Although a minority view, it is experimentally testable. Furthermore, parallels between heat physics and black holes hint that space-time may emerge from fundamental microscopic components, supported by approaches like the holographic principle.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Entropic gravity is a theory likened to the "brazil nut effect," where larger objects rise to the top when shaken. This occurs because larger nuts move slower relative to smaller ones, creating space beneath them filled by smaller nuts. Similarly, entropic gravity suggests that two massive objects attract each other due to a lower density region in their middle, resulting in fewer particles impacting them. The concept relies on assumptions about particle density, which can be challenging to justify. This effect is observable in everyday scenarios, such as shaking granular materials to separate sizes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Entropic gravity presents an intriguing framework, appealing to physicists who hope a fundamental theory of everything is rooted in microscopic quantum mechanics, with gravity emerging as an "accounting error." However, skepticism arises due to numerous assumptions underlying these theories, making it difficult to fully trust claims linking them to Einstein's field equations.
