**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 Dr. Jason Bara, a professor at The University of Alabama, is leading research to revolutionize plastic recycling through a new chemical process called imidazolysis. This method uses imidazole, a versatile organic compound, to break down polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into its monomers without the need for additional solvents or catalysts, potentially making the process more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. The process not only recycles PET, commonly found in food containers and bottles, but also shows promise in recycling polyurethanes, which are harder to recycle due to their complex composition. Imidazolysis allows for the recovery of valuable chemical intermediates, broadening the range of end products and applications for recycled materials. This research, supported by the National Science Foundation, aims to move towards a circular plastic economy where plastics are fully recycled into new products with little to no waste. The University of Alabama has filed a patent for this innovative recycling method.

## 6. [How NAT Traversal Works (2020)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600846)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Tailscale, a networking tool, achieves NAT (Network Address Translation) traversal to enable direct peer-to-peer connections between devices. Here are the key points:

1. **Protocol Choice**: Tailscale uses UDP for NAT traversal due to its simplicity compared to TCP, which adds complexity. For applications needing stream-oriented connections post-NAT traversal, QUIC is suggested as it operates over UDP.

2. **Direct Socket Control**: NAT traversal requires direct control over the network socket to manage additional packets not part of the main protocol. This might necessitate running a local proxy if direct socket access isn't feasible.

3. **NAT Traversal Techniques**: 
   - **Stateful Firewalls**: These track past packets to allow bidirectional communication for matching outbound and inbound UDP packets. This facilitates NAT traversal when the device behind the firewall initiates the connection.
   - **NAT Devices**: These translate private IP addresses to public ones, complicating direct connections. The article hints at techniques like hole punching or STUN/TURN servers, though not detailed in the provided text.

4. **Client/Server Model**: The simplest form of communication where the device behind the firewall (client) initiates the connection to a server, which then can communicate back. This model is less interesting for peer-to-peer scenarios where both devices might be behind NATs.

5. **Challenges**: The main challenges are dealing with stateful firewalls and NAT devices to ensure bidirectional UDP traffic can flow freely between peers.

The article uses Tailscale and other technologies like WebRTC as examples to explain these concepts, indicating that these techniques are broadly applicable across different protocols and systems aiming for peer-to-peer connectivity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the feasibility of using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for NAT (Network Address Translation) traversal through hole punching, a technique more commonly associated with UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Here are the key points:

- **Common Perception**: There's a general belief that TCP hole punching is more complex than UDP, which leads many to avoid it.

- **Author's Argument**: The author argues that the additional complexity of TCP over UDP for hole punching is marginal. They suggest that with modifications like supporting "simultaneous open" for TCP, the process could be made nearly as straightforward.

- **Network Restrictions**: The article points out that in some network environments, like the UC Berkeley guest Wi-Fi, UDP traffic is heavily restricted except for DNS, making TCP hole punching more relevant.

- **Conclusion**: While TCP hole punching involves more complexity, the author believes this complexity is often overstated, and TCP should not be dismissed out of hand for NAT traversal. 

The article references a link providing more technical details on TCP states which supports the concept of simultaneous open.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses concerns about implementing a technology called Tailscale in corporate networks. The author finds the technology fascinating and effective for its convenience but expresses significant security worries. The main concerns include:

- **Bypassing Traditional Security:** Tailscale could potentially bypass traditional Network Address Translation (NAT) and firewalls, instead relying on software Access Control Lists (ACLs). This shift might introduce new vulnerabilities.

- **Risk of Unauthorized Access:** If a malicious actor gains access to a virtual machine (VM) with Tailscale installed in an environment like AWS, they might have an unobstructed path to infiltrate the internal corporate network, potentially accessing sensitive systems or data without detection.

- **Visibility and Control:** The author questions whether there would be any indication or alert if an unauthorized person managed to penetrate this far into the network, highlighting a potential lack of transparency or control over access permissions managed solely by Tailscale's ACLs.

The author seems to appreciate the technology's benefits but is cautious about its security implications, suggesting a need for better understanding or additional security measures to mitigate these risks.

## 7. [Labwc: Wlroots-based window-stacking compositor for Wayland, inspired by openbox](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42597283)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 **Summary of the Article on Labwc:**

Labwc is a lightweight, wlroots-based compositor for Wayland, designed for window stacking, similar to Openbox. It focuses on efficient window management and basic window decorations, relying on external applications for additional desktop functionalities like panels and wallpapers. Labwc adopts a coding and operational style similar to wlroots and sway, and it strictly adheres to wayland and wlr protocols. Notably, it does not support control via dbus, sway/i3-IPC, or other custom IPCs to avoid fragmentation in the Wayland ecosystem, promoting broader adoption by sticking to standardized protocols.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with a virtual machine setup using Labwc, a Wayland compositor. Here are the key points:

- **Desired Features**: The author wants to implement:
  1. A virtual desktop switcher gadget that can be placed independently on the screen.
  2. A gadget for managing minimized applications, separate from the main taskbar.
  3. Both gadgets should ideally auto-hide when not in use.

- **Challenges**: The author couldn't find existing tools for Wayland that could achieve these functionalities without integrating them into a single taskbar like in MS Windows.

- **Additional Feature**: The author also expresses interest in screen edge bindings, where moving the mouse or a window to the screen's edge or corner triggers specific actions. There's uncertainty about whether this could be done with a standalone utility under Wayland or if it requires compositor-level support.

- **Positive Note on Labwc**: The author appreciates that Labwc allows for traditional X-style application menus through right or left-clicking the root window, which was simple to set up.

The article ends with the author asking for suggestions from the community on how to achieve these customizations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the decision not to control a certain aspect of software (likely a Wayland compositor) using dbus, sway/i3-IPC, or similar technologies. The reason provided is to avoid fragmentation in the adoption of Wayland by not introducing custom IPCs or protocols. However, the critique in the text suggests that this approach might actually increase fragmentation, as users or developers would need to develop their own methods to control the software, instead of using established, standard technologies like dbus.

## 8. [It Matters Who Owns Your Copylefted Copyrights (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42580397)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article by Bradley M. Kuhn discusses the contentious issue of copyright assignment in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Here are the key points:

1. **Paradox of Copyright Assignment**: Despite being controversial, copyright assignment has become a norm in FOSS, creating a paradox due to widespread misunderstanding.

2. **Current Events**: Significant FOSS projects like GCC and glibc are considering changing their copyright policies, which highlights the urgency of addressing this issue.

3. **Contributors' Discontent**: Many FOSS contributors dislike the process of assigning copyrights to another entity, finding it cumbersome or feeling pressured to give up ownership.

4. **Reality of Copyright Ownership**: Most contributors do not retain their copyrights; instead, these are often owned by their employers due to work-for-hire doctrines unless assigned to a charity like FSF or Conservancy.

5. **Impact on FOSS Projects**: If projects switch to policies where contributors retain their copyrights (like DCOs), over time, the copyrights might still end up with employers of prolific contributors, not the contributors themselves.

6. **Copyleft Enforcement**: The article stresses that enforcement of copyleft licenses like GPL relies on proactive action by copyright holders, not spontaneous compliance, challenging the myth that GPL enforcement happens automatically.

7. **Future Considerations**: Kuhn suggests that FOSS contributors and projects need to consider copyright policies carefully to ensure that the goals of FOSS are maintained, especially in terms of who can enforce the licenses.

The article concludes by urging FOSS contributors to understand their employment agreements and the implications of copyright ownership, advocating for better education and negotiation regarding copyrights in employment contracts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues against signing a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for two main reasons:

1. **Centralization of Copyright Ownership**: Centralizing copyright in one entity can lead to the project being locked down, potentially defeating the purpose of the GPL (copyleft). This central entity could change the project's direction or license terms, or engage in malicious legal actions against others, which goes against the ethos of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).

2. **Legal Standing to Enforce GPL**: Under U.S. law, regular users have the right to sue companies for not adhering to the GPL due to third-party beneficiary rights. This means that even without a centralized ownership, individuals or organizations contributing to the project can enforce the GPL. The author points out that even if the law were different (where only copyright owners could sue), centralizing ownership still wouldn't be necessary since joint copyright owners all have standing to sue. Instead of a CLA, the article suggests a policy where contributions could be accepted from developers or trusted FOSS organizations that are committed to GPL enforcement, thereby distributing the enforcement power and reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article expresses the author's decision to avoid contributing to or using free software that requires a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The author values shared copyright ownership as crucial for preserving software freedoms, arguing that it prevents any single entity from unilaterally changing the software's license in ways that might oppose the community's interests. Recent negative examples have reinforced this stance for the author.

## 9. [Back to basics: Why we chose long-polling over websockets](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600276)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 The article discusses the implementation of real-time updates in a system using **HTTP long polling** instead of WebSockets, focusing on the use of Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. Here's a summary:

- **Context**: The team needed a scalable solution for real-time updates due to the high volume of requests from numerous worker nodes to a PostgreSQL database.

- **Challenges**: The primary challenges were handling scale, avoiding the complexities of WebSockets, and ensuring efficient resource usage.

- **Solution - HTTP Long Polling**: 
  - **Analogy**: Long polling is compared to a train waiting for passengers (data) before departing, unlike short polling which follows a strict timetable or WebSockets which maintain an always-open connection.
  - **Implementation**: The Node.js/TypeScript backend was designed to send responses only when there is new data or when a timeout (TTL) is reached, optimizing server load and response immediacy.

- **Technical Breakdown**:
  - Functions were designed to handle requests efficiently, with proper indexing in PostgreSQL to manage frequent polling without performance degradation.
  - Key benefits included not needing to modify existing observability stacks, authentication mechanisms, or security patterns for WebSocket connections.

- **Advantages of Long Polling**:
  - No need for special configurations for firewalls or load balancers.
  - Simpler client-side code, easy reconnection handling, and standard HTTP metrics continue to function seamlessly.
  - Avoidance of issues like server restarts affecting connections.

- **Comparison with Alternatives**: 
  - While exploring, the team considered **ElectricSQL**, which provides real-time data synchronization but was deemed too high-level for their need for fine-grained control over message delivery.

- **Conclusion**: For systems requiring detailed control over real-time updates, HTTP long polling with Node.js and PostgreSQL was chosen over WebSockets or third-party solutions like ElectricSQL due to its simplicity, scalability, and alignment with existing infrastructure and security measures. However, ElectricSQL was recommended for scenarios not needing such low-level control.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issues encountered with long polling in the context of Second Life's client-server communication:

1. **Client-Side Issues**: Second Life uses an HTTPS long polling channel for data that is too large for UDP or requires encryption. The client uses libcurl, which has timeout settings. If the server has no data to send, libcurl will timeout, leading to a race condition where messages can be lost if the server tries to send data just after the timeout but before the next request.

2. **Server-Side Complications**: The actual server is behind an Apache server, which filters out irrelevant or malicious requests but also has its own timeout settings. This can lead to the termination of long poll connections that are idle, causing further issues with message delivery.

3. **Network and Middlebox Problems**: Long polling is not well-received by various network components like middleboxes and proxy servers, which might disconnect connections that remain open without data transfer for what is now considered a long time (sometimes as short as ten seconds).

4. **Unreliable Channel**: The combination of these issues results in an unreliable message channel. To mitigate this, sequence numbers are necessary to detect message duplication or loss, which were not initially accounted for, leading to intermittent system failures.

5. **Timeout Handling**: The article criticizes the lack of timeout handling in the original design, suggesting that sending periodic 'keep-alive' signals might be necessary to maintain the connection, though the optimal frequency for this is unclear.

Overall, the article highlights the challenges and potential unreliability of using long polling for real-time communication in systems like Second Life, suggesting a need for better timeout management and possibly alternative communication methods.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two methods to introduce a delay in asynchronous JavaScript code:

1. **Using `Promise` and `setTimeout`**: The first method involves creating a new `Promise` that resolves after a specified timeout period. This is shown with `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));`, where the delay is set to 500 milliseconds.

2. **Using `node:timers/promises` in Node.js**: The second, simpler method is specific to Node.js environments, where you can directly import `setTimeout` from the `node:timers/promises` module. This allows for a more straightforward delay implementation with `await setTimeout(500);`.

The key point is that in Node.js, using the `node:timers/promises` module provides a cleaner syntax for handling delays in asynchronous operations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses confusion about the purpose and appeal of a visual effect or technology that involves removing motion blur and simulating old CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) displays. The author questions:

1. **Motion Blur Removal**: Why visual effects professionals, who typically work hard to add realistic motion blur to enhance the visual experience, would want to remove it.

2. **Simulation of CRT Displays**: The intent behind trying to replicate the visual characteristics of old CRT monitors, which might seem outdated or unnecessary to some.

The author is seeking clarification on these points, indicating a lack of understanding or context about why such visual techniques might be desirable or useful in modern contexts.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a new simulation method designed to replicate the visual characteristics of CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) displays on modern high refresh rate screens. This method:

1. **Reduces Motion Blur**: It effectively decreases motion blur on displays with a refresh rate of 120Hz or higher without the need to dim the image, unlike the current method of black frame insertion.

2. **Versatile Application**: Beyond just retro gaming, this method can be applied to various applications, including flight simulators, to reduce blur. However, the text does not confirm if using this method would make non-retro content like flight simulators visually resemble CRT displays with phosphors. 

3. **Additional Features**: The method also simulates other aspects of CRT displays, although specifics aren't detailed in the summary provided.

The article implies that while the primary goal is to reduce blur, the simulation might include some visual traits of CRTs, but it's not explicitly stated if all aspects, like phosphor glow, are replicated in non-retro applications.
