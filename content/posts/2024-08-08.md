### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the advancement of AI coding assistance in the coming years. It highlights that chat AI lacks a clear reward function and struggles to judge the quality of responses to open-ended questions. On the other hand, coding AI is capable of writing tests, code, and compiling, examining failed test cases, and searching for different coding solutions. This process can be used as training data for future AI coding models. The author also predicts that language models will improve in mathematical theorem proving, as theorem verification software can provide accurate feedback for reinforcement learning. Additionally, the article suggests that the combination of vibes (approach to the proof) and formal verification can be beneficial. It explains that formal verification of program correctness has not gained popularity in the past due to its tedious nature, but with language models in the mix, it may become more feasible. LLMs generating annotations for engines to prove correctness could be the missing piece in this equation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests a cheap and do-it-yourself method to achieve the same results as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by fine-tuning a model to include a score in its output. RLHF is needed because it is difficult to create a loss function for determining a good answer. To implement the DIY method, the model initially generates multiple completions for a prompt, which are then manually scored. These prompt and completion pairs with scores become the training set. Once trained, it is possible to include the desired score in the prompt to influence the model to produce an answer consistent with that score.

## 3. [In ‘The Book Against Death,’ Elias Canetti rants against mortality](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41186117)

**Total comment counts : 51**

### Summary

 The article discusses the life and beliefs of Elias Canetti, a renowned writer who desperately sought immortality. Canetti, an irreligious Jew, rejected the idea of an afterlife and instead desired eternal life in the physical world. He believed that consciousness was meaningless without the body and was vehement in his pursuit of immortality for all humans. Canetti's lifelong obsession with immortality stemmed from the terrors he witnessed during the 20th century, including the unexpected death of his father at a young age and the devastation of two World Wars. Despite his survivor's guilt, Canetti's opposition to death was not solely personal or political, but almost primal. The article also highlights Canetti's unique writing style, characterized by allegorical and learned jottings. His famous works, such as "Auto-da-Fé" and "Crowds and Power," explore themes of monomania and humanity's fear of mortality. Overall, Canetti's writing reflects his deep-seated desire for eternal life.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the differing opinions regarding extending human life. There is a divide between those who wonder why anyone would want to die and those who believe life would become unbearable if extended. The author argues that if life is extended, people will take advantage of it and strange consequences will follow. The debate revolves around how long life should be, while also trying to avoid death. The author personally prefers death because it adds significance to life and provides a sense of calmness since it is beyond their control. The article also mentions Planck's principle, which can be found at the provided link.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the motivations behind people's desire for immortality. It suggests that the fear of death and the desire to experience life in the future are common motivations. However, the concept of immortality itself does not make sense because humans are products of their time. If someone were to live thousands of years in the future, they would have to evolve to adapt to that time period, which would result in a lack of continuity with their current self. Therefore, true immortality only makes sense over smaller timescales, such as centuries. The author also mentions that people who have lived through significant historical events may not be fully engaged in the present and instead spend time reminiscing about their past experiences.

## 4. [How we found and fixed an eBPF Linux kernel vulnerability](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41189971)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article is reminding readers that on platforms where eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is commonly used, verifier bugs are not significant because unprivileged code is not allowed to load eBPF programs. These bugs are therefore considered root-to-ring0 vulnerabilities, which are important but typically worth the tradeoff for server-side work. Additionally, eBPF has a strong track record for kernel Local Privilege Escalations (LPEs) compared to the kernel as a whole. The value of the verifier lies in preventing accidental kernel crashes caused by flawed eBPF programs. This is not the case with ordinary Loadable Kernel Modules (LKM).

## 5. [GPT-4 LLM simulates people well enough to replicate social science experiments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41185783)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 The article introduces a demo that predicts experimental treatment effects on U.S. adults using large language models (LLMs). Due to hosting costs, the demo uses GPT-4o-mini instead of GPT-4. The demo is a technical evaluation of LLMs' predictions for experiments conducted in the US. The article acknowledges that there are concerns about bias, over-reliance, and misuse when using LLMs to simulate participants. The predictions generated for different racial, gender, and partisan groups in the US are found to be similarly accurate. However, other research focusing on simulating survey responses has found biases against groups with less internet access or historical underrepresentation. The article advises caution in interpreting estimated subpopulation effects. The demo can be accessed through the advanced menu and allows users to input multiple treatments or upload a text file. The tool includes guardrails to prevent misuse and optimize its use for scientific research while minimizing socially harmful purposes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses skepticism about the claims made in an article. The article states that GPT-4 is more accurate than human forecasters in predicting the outcome of an experiment. However, the author argues that this is not a valid benchmark, as people do not trust human forecasters in the first place. They believe that knowing GPT-4 is slightly better at predicting experiments does not make it a useful substitute for conducting the actual experiment.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential dangers of relying on GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models to make policy decisions. The author highlights examples where policy decisions were made based on GPT's predictions, which turned out to negatively impact society. The article suggests that these emulations of social experiments can become self-fulfilling prophecies and lead to unintended consequences. The author also mentions the importance of human judgment and warns against blindly following the predictions of machine learning models.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 NASA managers are facing uncertainty regarding whether to choose a Starliner or Dragon for the return of astronauts. NASA engineers are on the high end of the risk band and are advocating for a Dragon return, while Boeing believes the risk is low. The data does not favor either option, so more data is needed to narrow down the uncertainty. If the uncertainty is not resolved, it is likely that a Dragon return will be chosen. The decision needs to be made by mid-August to prepare for the Crew-9 launch in September. They emphasized that the thruster problems can be fixed and even if Starliner returns without a crew, they can still learn enough from the test to potentially certify it for regular service. Starliner is being held to a higher standard than Dragon, as having Dragon as an alternative makes NASA question the need to take any risk. There is a difference in perspective between NASA engineers and lay people, with engineers focusing on managing uncertainty and assessing risks.

## 8. [Argdown, like Markdown for argument mapping](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41186310)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article explains that Argdown, a tool for argumentation, has a simple syntax that allows users to express pros and cons in a way that is similar to writing a Twitter message. Users only need to learn a few rules to define complex relations between arguments. Argdown can be used within Markdown and transforms code into an argument map in real-time. The analysis can be published as a PDF, embedded in a webpage, or exported as an image. The article also mentions the ability to choose different argument map styles and provides instructions on how to access the resulting argument map. Additionally, the article suggests checking out the ArgVu font and provides tips for troubleshooting unexpected results in the map.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of using a tree structure to present arguments and suggests using a more flexible approach called LLM-embedding. The author explains that the traditional tree structure does not accurately represent the complexities of arguments and proposes that a more nuanced approach involving "relevant statements" with different dimensions (such as support, counter, expansion, example) would be more effective. The article concludes by suggesting that this approach would result in a structure that is not even a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the mistaken belief that a particular tool was designed for managing complex arguments for command-line tools.

## 9. [Firefox Sidebar and Vertical tabs: try them out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41192118)

**Total comment counts : 58**

### Summary

 The article announces that vertical tabs and a new sidebar experience are now available in Nightly 131, addressing the community's requests for these features. The goal is to make context-switching and multitasking during browsing more seamless. The work is still in progress, with regular refinements expected in the coming months and community feedback is encouraged. Web extension developers are also invited to test their extensions with the new features enabled.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author used to be a tree-style-tabs power user but switched back to regular tabs because they found that the horizontal tab space represents the actual number of tabs that they can effectively have open at once. They viewed the squished tabs as a reminder to close unnecessary ones. They realized that using tabs as a form of short-term working memory was not beneficial for their focus. Instead, they now keep a list of relevant URLs in a text file and use two browser windows - one for stateful browsing and one for stateless browsing. In the stateless session, they can close tabs without losing anything important, while anything significant is noted down elsewhere.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a recent screenshot found on Reddit that shows a new feature in Firefox, which is vertical tabs. The author expresses hope that the vertical tabs will have a similar nesting feature to Tree Style Tab, which they believe is the best implementation of this idea across all browsers. The author also comments on Firefox's user interface, stating that it has stagnated compared to other browsers like Chrome that have groups and profiles. They hope that Firefox will innovate more and get out of its stale and boring state. The article includes a link to the Reddit post for more information.
