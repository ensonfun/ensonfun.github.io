## 1. [Researchers have found a faster way to do integer linear programming](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39185198)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 Researchers have made a breakthrough in solving the traveling salesperson problem, one of the oldest computational questions. They have developed a faster algorithm for solving integer linear programming (ILP) problems, which involve optimizing whole-number amounts. ILP is used in various applications such as production planning and vehicle routing. The new algorithm improves upon previous ones by combining geometric tools to limit the possible solutions. It has received recognition as a major advancement in ILP solvers and represents the first significant improvement in nearly 40 years. The algorithm works by transforming a given problem into a set of linear equations and inequalities. The breakthrough builds on the work of mathematician Hendrik Lenstra, who first proved that the general ILP problem was solvable and introduced a geometric approach to solving it. The algorithm searches for the intersection of the set of possible solutions and a lattice of integers. This breakthrough has the potential to have significant implications for solving complex optimization problems efficiently.

## 9. [Senator Wyden Letter Confirms NSA Is Buying US Persons' Data from Data Brokers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39189481)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 This article reveals that the National Security Agency (NSA) is buying Americans' internet records from data brokers, which can reveal their website visits and app usage. Senator Ron Wyden released documents confirming this practice and called on the administration to ensure intelligence agencies stop buying illegally obtained personal data. Wyden argues that the U.S. government should not support an industry that violates Americans' privacy. The article questions why the NSA needs to purchase data when it can obtain it through its own surveillance methods. The secrecy around data purchases has kept the public unaware, and it took Wyden holding a top NSA position hostage for the government to admit to buying data from brokers for domestic surveillance. Wyden calls for investigations into the data brokers' practices and asks each intelligence agency to provide an inventory of data purchased from brokers. The NSA denies buying location data but admits to purchasing non-content data related to domestic internet communications.
