## 3. [MacRelix – Unix-like features for classic Mac OS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40338443)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 MacRelix is a Unix-like environment that can be run on classic Mac OS. It supports classic 68K and PPC Mac OS, as well as Mac OS X on PPC through Carbon. To get started with MacRelix, users need to download the installer, which requires a classic Mac OS with Open Transport and an internet connection. Source code for MacRelix can be found on GitHub, and users can contact the developer for any questions or comments.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article mentions that they have uploaded the 68k MacMinix 1.5 release source on GitHub. The original file dates were not preserved, but were archived using tar(1) to dump the files to a floppy disk on a PowerBook 150 running MacMinix. The author is unsure why they did this but provides a link to GitHub where the source can be accessed.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article talks about the Aztec C development environment, which provided a limited Unix-like experience for development. It mentions that users coded in vi, used make, and had basic shell commands like ls, cat, mv, and cp. The author admits to not having much experience with Unix, so they can't comment on what might be missing in Aztec C. They believe that if they were to use it now, they would likely run into some deficiencies compared to a normal Unix environment. The article concludes by noting that Aztec C was an early "Unix on Mac" experience, dating back to 1985.

## 4. [Protecting your email address via SVG instead of JavaScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40340642)

**Total comment counts : 49**

### Summary

 This article discusses a technique for protecting email addresses from email-harvesting spambots. Conventionally, email protection techniques involve using HTML, CSS, and JS, but these approaches have their limitations. The alternative technique described in the article uses SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) instead. This approach has the advantage of not requiring JavaScript, allowing the email address to remain accessible and protected even when JavaScript is turned off. Unlike other no-JavaScript approaches, this SVG-based technique allows for standard mailto: links. However, it should be noted that this technique may not protect the email address from determined and sophisticated spambots. Additionally, SVGs, being graphics documents, still allow human visitors to copy the email address by right-clicking on the embedded SVG. The article provides an example of how to implement this technique and emphasizes the importance of maintaining accessibility.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses whether email addresses published on webpages need protection from email-harvesting spambots. The author shares their personal experience of having their email address on their website for 20 years without receiving spam that bypasses their spam filter. They mention using both Gmail and a webmail service hosted by a local company, both of which effectively filter out spam. The author concludes that protection is not solely dependent on Google and other email providers can also effectively prevent spam.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses the details of their domain, including the length of time it has been registered and its .com extension. They also mention that their email address is prominently displayed on the front page in a H3 tag. The article states that the author's email address does not have a spam problem, as they only receive around 15 spam emails per day, including those in the Junk folder. The author attributes this to their use of Purelymail. However, the article notes that the author does experience issues with transactional emails that are unrelated to actual transactions, promotional emails that are considered junk spam, and complaints from social networks about not being used.

## 5. [The USDA's gardening zones shifted, this map shows you what's changed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40342578)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The USDA has updated its plant hardiness map for the first time in 11 years. The new map shows that the lowest winter temperatures across the country have increased by an average of 3.3 degrees Fahrenheit compared to the previous map. These changes are mainly attributed to the warming climate, as winters are warming at a faster pace than other seasons. The hardiness zone is a measurement of the coldest yearly temperature in an area over the past 30 years, and it is used to predict the survival of winter plants. Gardeners can use the hardiness zone as a tool to assess the risk of plant survival and choose appropriate plants for their area. However, the hardiness zone alone cannot determine exactly what plants will thrive in a specific area, as factors like precipitation and summer temperatures also play a role.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses three updates to zones over the past 50 years, with some of the changes attributed to improved data accuracy. However, the significant factor influencing these updates is climate change. The author mentions living in an area where winters are now 4.5 degrees warmer, which has had an impact on their gardening.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article provides two links. The first link is to a map related to plant hardiness, specifically to view the map. The second link is a frame link that redirects to a website called ArcGIS.

## 10. [Did GitHub Copilot increase my productivity?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40338241)

**Total comment counts : 43**

### Summary

 The author reflects on their experience using GitHub Copilot, a code generation tool. They initially found Copilot helpful and magical but eventually realized they were more productive without it. The author used Copilot for their personal projects, specifically for writing boilerplate code. However, Copilot struggled with unique codebases and had limitations in predicting the correct code. The author concludes that while Copilot has its benefits, it is not always reliable and doesn't match human intuition.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article talks about their experience with using Entity Framework (EF), Microsoft's data handling framework for .NET applications. They initially found EF's Lazy Loading feature convenient, as it automatically loaded data from the database into memory structures. However, they soon discovered that Lazy Loading was not consistent, leading to occasional data not being populated. They had to manually load the data themselves, defeating the purpose of Lazy Loading. The author compares this experience to the current state of AI for coding, stating that it often makes mistakes that require manual checks and corrections. They feel that AI for coding is similar to their experience with EF, where they needed to manually correct its actions, making them question the usefulness of using AI in coding. The author mentions that EF has improved since their experience, but they have since switched to using Linux and learning the programming language Go, which they find more reliable.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article finds GitHub Copilot to be of limited use for production code. They claim that the most difficult bugs they encountered in the past year were in code written by Copilot, as it tends to make subtle mistakes. However, the author finds Copilot more helpful for test code, where it can suggest additional test cases based on a formulaic structure. The author does not see any value in using Copilot for chat purposes.
