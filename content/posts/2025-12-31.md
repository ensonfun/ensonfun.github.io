## 1. [I canceled my book deal](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46446815)

**Total comment counts : 43**

### Summary

 An Associate Teaching Professor at CMU recounts deciding to publish a technical book with a traditional publisher after blogging success. He chose a publisher over self-publishing, collaborating on a concept: a collection of self-contained tutorials on classic coding projects, including a revised “Let’s make a Teeny Tiny compiler” chapter and a finale of smaller projects. The contract required a detailed proposal, audience, and TOC; he projected 115,500–132,000 words (~350–400 pages) with 10–30 illustrations. They offered a $5,000 advance, 12%–15% royalties, and 50% on translations; most titles sell in thousands, top titles in hundreds of thousands. He received 25 author copies.

### Overall Comments Summary

## 3. [Privacy and control. My tech setup](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46446938)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 Privacy is a misnomer; what matters is control over your digital identity and how data and incentives shape what you see and do. Framing it this way, the author shares a personal threat model and practical steps to reduce corporate reach: use a password manager (GNUpass, Bitwarden); prefer Signal; avoid Venmo; run GrapheneOS on Android for sandboxed apps and granular permissions; use open-source apps from F-Droid and disable Google Play/Location services to save power; limit social media; use a domain email ([email protected]); browse with Firefox/Privacy Badger; host calendar/contacts on Raspberry Pi (CalDAV) with DAVx⁵; Cloudflare as registrar/DNS for aligned incentives.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion weighs whether GrapheneOS is a practical daily driver given banking app compatibility and the privacy/control tradeoffs of centralized services.
- Concern: The main worry is risking being unable to use essential services due to app compatibility issues and gatekeeping from centralized providers like Cloudflare.
- Perspectives: Views range from pragmatic caution and gradual testing of GrapheneOS to strong advocacy for digital self-sovereignty and distrust of centralized infrastructure, with some favoring mainstream OSes as a safer balance.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 Hidden Palace and Last Minute Continue celebrate the holidays with a prototypes release, featuring Shadow the Hedgehog E3/GameCube variants and a batch of other items (Sega Classics, Sonic Gems, Billy Hatcher, Sonic Riders, Schoolhouse, etc.), plus a Discord discussion and a Twitch stream. The post also offers a long retrospective on Sonic's history and Sega's 2001 shift to third-party publishing, explaining how changes at Sega affected Sonic's creative output and the Dreamcast era's trajectory.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread discusses advanced DVD data recovery methods using raw reads, cross-block ECC, and combining results from multiple reads and discs to salvage damaged DVDs.
- Concern: A major worry is that drive cleanliness and unclear ECC behavior across large data blocks could leave data unrecovered or misread, making the approach unreliable without clear conclusions.
- Perspectives: Participants present mixed views: some advocate ddrescue and block-size strategies as effective, while others seek concrete parameters and sources (e.g., READ BUF SCSI, DiscImageMender) and question the mechanisms behind 16-block ECC.
- Overall sentiment: Cautiously optimistic.

## 5. [Scaffolding to Superhuman: How Curriculum Learning Solved 2048 and Tetris](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46445195)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 Using PufferLib, the author trained RL agents to beat large search-based solvers on 2048 and Tetris with a 15MB policy trained in 75 minutes. PufferLib enables fast RL (1M+ steps/sec/core) and supports LSTM, Pareto sweeps, and cost-aware hyperparameter searches. Through 200 sweeps and curriculum tweaks, a 3.7M-parameter LSTM policy reached 65,536-tile success at 14.75% and 32,768-tile at 71.22% (115k episodes). A bug in one-hot encoding created curriculum-like robustness, yielding two curriculum approaches. Tetris is easier; scale networks only after solid observations and rewards. Training run on two RTX 4090s.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on curriculum learning for AI systems (notably RL and LLMs), including a new library to order training data by difficulty, practical benefits, and comparisons to related ideas like masked language modeling.  
- Concern: The main worry is that curriculum tuning is highly parameter-sensitive and problem-dependent, risking instability, forgetting, or poor generalization if not carefully managed.  
- Perspectives: Views range from enthusiastic reports of practical benefits and connections to MLM to skepticism about generalizability and concerns that hype around AI curriculum discussions may be overstated.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [The compiler is your best friend](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46445131)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The script contrasts two outcomes: a nightmarish production crash from a hidden null pointer vs a calm fix after minor compile-time errors, arguing for honest compiler feedback. It explains what a compiler does and why typechecking matters, then surveys languages with different pipelines, focusing on Rust’s ahead-of-time compilation, macro expansion, and aggressive optimizations. Rust enables zero-cost abstractions and, crucially, memory safety without a garbage collector by enforcing unique ownership with a compile-time borrow checker, preventing dangling pointers and data races caused by shared mutable state.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Discussion centers on best practices for error handling and software architecture (functional core/imperative shell) and how language design—types, exceptions, memory management—affects reliability and complexity.  
- Concern: The main worry is that overly cautious or dogmatic approaches to error handling or type systems can introduce bugs, security vulnerabilities, or unsustainable complexity.  
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from favoring explicit logging and top-level crash handling to embracing a functional-core approach, with ongoing debates about Rust, C++, Swift, and typing that reflect divergent experiences and philosophies.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

- Overall sentiment: Mostly positive with usability caveats.

## 9. [My role as a founder-CTO: year 8](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46395438)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 2025 felt like a decade for a startup founder: rapid shifts and a vibe-coding era, with apps easier to build and paths for developers to monetize. RevenueCat nearly sold: a respected company offered nine figures, a liquidity moment that would have ended ownership and culture. After weighing the option, they declined, believing the current momentum and potential outweighed a quick exit. They documented what would make them quit; most risks were solvable with money or controllable. They raised another round with a meaningful secondary to de-risk and keep building toward a generational company with an inspired team and family security.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether RevenueCat’s founders should have sold for a nine-figure exit and how succession planning, equity for employees, and startup culture intersect with that decision.
- Concern: The worry is that keeping the company dependent on the founders and avoiding a clean exit could hurt employee outcomes and long-term value as market conditions and platform ecosystems evolve.
- Perspectives: Views range from urging a sale or clearer succession and better employee upside to defending the founders’ control and continued fundraising, with broader criticism of startup culture and VC incentives.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 10. [When square pixels aren't square](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46443988)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 Web video embedding reserves space using a fixed aspect ratio to avoid layout shifts. A bug arose from not applying pixel aspect ratio (PAR). QuickTime shows two resolutions: storage SAR 1920×1080 and display DAR 1350×1080; DAR = SAR × PAR. PAR defines pixel shape, so non-square pixels can stretch images (e.g., 1920×1080 with PAR 45:64 yields DAR 1350×1080). Using only stored width/height caused letterboxing or reflow when the video loaded. The author uses ffprobe/ffmpeg to extract PAR, compute display width, and demonstrates via before/after frames. Fix: incorporate PAR in dimension calculations.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Pixels are not inherently square and aspect ratios across video, film, and displays are more complex than they first appear.
- Concern: If pixel geometry and non-square formats are misunderstood, images can be mis-scaled or misrepresented across media.
- Perspectives: Views range from accepting non-square pixels and varied raster shapes as normal, to drawing analogies with anamorphic optics and historical formats, to accusing the author of intentionally tweaking aspect ratios.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
