The award sends a strong message to the Iranian authorities about the importance of women's rights. The article also mentions the protests in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini, which led to the resurgence of the morality police and the enactment of a new, harsh hijab law. The Nobel Peace Prize winner from the previous year, Oleksandra Matviichuk, a Ukrainian human rights defender, praised Mohammadi's fight against the oppression of women in Iran and emphasized the need for solidarity among those fighting for freedom. The article highlights the significance of Mohammadi's win as only the 19th woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in its history. It acknowledges the efforts of other female laureates and discusses the history of the prize being predominantly awarded to highly educated white men from Europe and the US. Finally, the article mentions the personal costs Mohammadi has faced, including numerous arrests, imprisonment, and separation from her family.

## 7. [OpenPubKey and Sigstore](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37786781)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article discusses the OpenPubKey project, which is a new scheme for using OIDC providers to sign objects. It compares OpenPubKey to Sigstore, highlighting the major difference being the elimination of centralized components in OpenPubKey. The article explores the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, focusing on the privacy concerns and complexity introduced by using OIDC signing keys for verification. It explains the keyless flow in Sigstore and OpenPubKey and examines the challenges in historical verification and maintaining trust in OpenPubKey. The article concludes by suggesting that Sigstore is more suitable for most supply chain security use-cases due to its ability to mitigate complexity and privacy concerns.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential issues with the architecture of OpenID Connect (OIDC), specifically related to the responsibility of clients to monitor for leaks and revoke affected keys. It criticizes the centralized trust placed in Identity Providers (IdPs) who may be negligent, while burdening clients with the task of ensuring security. The article also warns about the abuse of OIDC, stating that if it becomes widely adopted, any hacks or vulnerabilities will become ingrained in the standard, preventing further development and adjustment. Two sources are provided for further information on the topic.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses confusion and concerns about OpenPubKey, specifically regarding its use of the OIDC 'nonce' claim as a public key stuffing mechanism. They highlight that controlling the nonce in popular OIDC IdPs is not common and may have restrictions. The author also mentions that OpenPubKey does not adequately address the issue of key rotation on OIDC IdPs, which they consider to be a significant problem. They suggest that introducing a key transparency scheme could help address this concern, but it would require running trusted infrastructure. The author agrees with privacy concerns and notes that both OpenPubKey and Sigstore have potential privacy and security implications, but Sigstore does not leak the JWTs themselves.

## 8. [Supernova in 1006](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37783654)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses SN 1006, a supernova that is considered to be the brightest observed stellar event in recorded history. It appeared between April 30 and May 1, 1006, in the constellation of Lupus and was described by observers across various regions, including China, Japan, Iraq, Egypt, and Europe. The supernova was possibly recorded in North American petroglyphs as well. It was visible even during the daytime and was described as a large circular body with intense light. Some astrologers interpreted the event as a sign of plague and famine. The supernova was observed for several months before disappearing. Petroglyphs in Arizona and New Mexico have been interpreted as representations of the supernova, although some researchers remain skeptical. The associated supernova remnant was not identified until 1965, and no neutron star or black hole has been found. Further research suggests that SN 1006 most likely had double degenerate progenitors, meaning it resulted from the merging of two white dwarf stars. The article also mentions that the supernova did not have significant effects on Earth, but its outburst can be found in nitrate deposits in Antarctic ice.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In December, a star was sighted in the constellation Di. Chinese astrologer Zhou Keming interpreted the star as an auspicious one that would bring prosperity to the state. However, it is important to note that the reported color yellow may have been chosen for political reasons.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses two locations, White Tank Mountain Regional Park in Arizona and Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico, where petroglyphs were found and interpreted as the first known North American representations of a supernova. However, some researchers remain skeptical of this interpretation, questioning whether indigenous people at that time would have recognized the constellation Scorpio.

## 9. [Ways to break your systems code using volatile (2010)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37785706)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 This article explains the use of the volatile qualifier in C/C++ and its connection with the abstract and actual machines. The article describes how volatile is used to establish a connection between the abstract and real semantics of a program, especially in situations where the standard semantics fail to capture important facts. It also discusses the dangers of misusing volatile and provides examples of both correct and incorrect usage. The article emphasizes the importance of using volatile only when there is a precise technical justification and warns against using it indiscriminately. It also discusses other topics related to volatile, such as type qualification, inconsistent qualification, and the limitations of volatile in multi-threaded programming.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the need for using the "volatile" keyword in portable C programming. It identifies two situations where using "volatile" is necessary: when an asynchronous signal handler modifies a variable inspected by the mainline code, and when a function modifies automatic local variables after saving and restoring a context using setjmp() and longjmp(). The article emphasizes that regardless of how a C compiler treats "volatile", it must work correctly in these situations to be ISO C conforming. A code example is provided to demonstrate how the removal of "volatile" can affect the expected output.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that while the post still remains accurate, in 2011 C and C++ introduced atomics as a more portable alternative to using volatile for atomicity. These atomics can be more efficient than the locks mentioned in the post, particularly in CPUs with higher core counts.
