### Summary

 This article provides a list of useful tips and tricks for maximizing the functionality of your browser's debugger. It assumes a moderate to advanced understanding of developer tools. Some of the tips mentioned include using expressions with side effects in unexpected places, such as logging to the console within breakpoints, creating conditional breakpoints to simulate logpoints in Firefox, using console.log in the watch pane, setting DOM mutation breakpoints, finding the source of unpaired function calls, measuring the execution time of code using console timing API, pausing execution based on specific conditions, creating conditional breakpoints for excluding certain lines from pausing, assigning unique IDs to class instances, using global booleans to control conditional breakpoints, tracing class method calls using Chrome's monitor command, debugging functions in the console without knowing the source, pausing execution before URL modifications in single-page applications, using object getters with debugger calls to track property reads, copying information directly to the clipboard using console API, using the JS console to diagnose HTML/CSS problems, pausing JS execution to inspect a conditional DOM element, and accessing the DOM and event listeners in the debugger.

## 5. [When NASA Used an RC Tiger II to Drill into Space Shuttle Tires](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38228114)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses how NASA used a remote control tank, specifically a Tamiya remote control Tiger tank, to help test and release pressure from tires on the Space Shuttle. This was necessary because the tires were subjected to tremendous forces during landing and could explode with the force of dynamite. The tank, named the Tire Assault Vehicle (TAV), was custom-made with a drill and camera attached to it and used to approach the damaged Shuttle tires and drill holes in them. The TAV proved to be a successful and cost-effective method for safely handling the dangerous task.

## 6. [Texture Healing for Monospace Fonts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38221379)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 Texture Healing is a feature created for the Github Type System series of Monospace fonts. Monospace fonts have certain compromises in their design, such as narrow glyphs like 'i' feeling wide and wide glyphs like 'm' feeling narrow. Texture Healing aims to address these issues by creating alternates for certain glyphs that can give or take space. These alternates shift to the left or right without changing the glyph bounds. The goal is to improve the spacing and density of words without changing the overall word length or monospacing. The feature uses OpenType classes and lookups to determine when to use the alternate glyphs. Texture Healing can be implemented in any modern font editor.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is bothered by the fact that the same letter glyph can vary within a word. They give the example of the letter "m" being narrower between the two "i"s in the word "minimum," which is unsettling to them. They feel the same way about the letters "i" in the word "miniature." This inconsistency gives the author the sensation of looking through a fish-eye lens or having an incorrect glasses prescription.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a coding website and shares some opinions about its usability. The author mentions that while the site may be good for reading code, they find it strange that the size of letters changes while typing. They also point out some issues with readability, such as combinations of letters appearing differently and the strange formatting of line numbers.

## 8. [Hashmaps in Factor are faster than in Zig](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38224033)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience with the Zig programming language and compares its performance to that of the Factor programming language. They encounter a performance issue in Zig's implementation of HashMap, which causes it to slow down over time. The author identifies the issue as fragmentation in the HashMap due to the use of tombstone buckets. They propose a solution by implementing a rehashing method in HashMap, which significantly improves performance. They share their findings with the Zig community and suggest further improvements. The author also suggests that Factor could benefit from similar enhancements.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues against the use of tombstones in linear probing, except in a concurrent context where entries cannot be moved. It suggests a tombstone-free deletion algorithm which is simple and does not require rehashing. A link to the algorithm implementation is provided.
