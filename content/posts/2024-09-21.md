## 7. [Porsche's idea for a six-stroke internal combustion engine](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41607887)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 Porsche has introduced a novel concept for a six-stroke combustion engine, aiming to enhance efficiency and power output compared to the traditional four-stroke design. In a standard engine, the process involves four strokes: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. Porsche's design proposes adding an additional compression and power stroke, resulting in two sequences of three strokes: intake-compression-power and compression-power-exhaust. This is facilitated by a unique crankshaft design that alters the piston's travel, allowing for two top and bottom dead centers. This new setup could improve power generation from one stroke in three instead of one in four. However, the increased complexity raises questions about its practicality and potential adoption. Ultimately, this innovation reflects Porsche's commitment to enhancing combustion technology in the face of the growing electric vehicle trend.

The article also raises questions about multi-point ignition and controlling combustion dynamics. Additionally, it highlights the potential for rethinking materials engineering in engines to reduce costs and weight, suggesting that many current assumptions in internal combustion engine design may be reconsidered.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author, a programmer, discusses the operation of a specific engine that performs one intake stroke, two compression-power strokes, and an exhaust stroke. They note that the initial compression-power strokes occur with the piston moving lower, leading to lower compression, while the second strokes occur higher, resulting in higher compression. The author contemplates the relationship between fuel richness and compression tolerances, questioning whether the engine's design uses a rich mixture with low compression in the first power stroke to prevent knocking, followed by a higher compression second stroke to burn residual fuel. They consider if this approach represents an evolution of variable compression ratio engines and speculate whether the engine aims for a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, relying on exhaust gases to mitigate knocking during the second compression.
