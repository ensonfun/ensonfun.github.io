 The article discusses the cosmic distance ladder, a series of gradual experiments used to determine astronomical distances. It describes how ancient astronomers, like Eratosthenes and Aristarchus, calculated the Earth's radius and the distance to the moon through lunar eclipses. Using trigonometry and observations of the moon's phases, they inferred the distance to the sun. Subsequent measurements, such as the transit of Venus, allowed precision in calculating the astronomical unit—the Earth’s distance from the sun. The ladder continues, utilizing methods like light speed measurement and Hubble's law to explore the expanding universe.

## 7. [QUIC for the kernel](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44746948)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 QUIC was developed to resolve issues faced by TCP, such as latency from the three-way handshake, head-of-line blocking, and lack of multiple data streams. Built on UDP, QUIC eliminates these problems by speeding up connection setup, maintaining end-to-end encryption, and allowing independent stream operations. Initially implemented in user space for speed, its evolution is now focusing on kernel integration, aiming for better performance. Benchmark tests show initial performance lags compared to in-kernel TLS and TCP, but improvements are expected as hardware support develops. Overall, QUIC offers faster connections with enhanced privacy and efficiency.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the addition of `ssl_preread_server_name` in an NGINX configuration to forward TLS streams to another NGINX instance for specific domains, facilitating a failover mechanism through DNS updates. However, this method is incompatible with HTTP/3, which encrypts the SNI during the handshake, rendering `ssl_preread_server_name` ineffective. The author questions what alternatives exist for SNI-based routing in HTTP/3 and whether continuing with HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 over TLS is the recommended solution for such setups.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the disadvantages of QUIC, a transport protocol, highlighting issues with its performance over fast internet connections.
