### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author does not understand the curved keyboard wells present on the Glove80 and Kinesis Advantage keyboards. They prefer typing on a flat keyboard by swinging their fingers up and down instead of bending the joints. They feel that the keys above the home row and function keys on the Kinesis Advantage are too high and angled towards their hands, making it feel like they are curling their fingers and lifting their whole hand to press the keys. However, they greatly prefer typing on the Kinesis Gaming Keyboard and find it better than using welled keyboards.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses satisfaction with the Glove80, a keyboard they have been using. They initially had a 3D printed prototype and helped with the LED status display code. Despite dropping the prototype, it still works. They now have a production model with white clicky keyswitches and prefer it over the Kinesis Advantage2, which they had been using for over two decades. They appreciate the clicky keyswitches, ergonomic design, and repairability of the Glove80. They also mention that the keyboard has open firmware, allowing for customization, and is small and light for travel. Adapting to the new keyboard layout was initially challenging, but they have since adjusted.

## 2. [Everything I know about floppy disks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37376369)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The article discusses the technology and mechanics behind floppy disk drives. It explains the different sizes of floppy disks, the components of a drive, and how data is read and written on the disks. The article also covers topics such as track movement, compatibility issues, interface connectors, writing protection, encoding techniques, and disk density. It concludes by mentioning advancements in technology and the eventual decline of floppy disk drives.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article explains the concept of the "write protect" notch on floppy disks. The notch determines whether a floppy disk is read/write or read-only. If the notch is present, the disk is read/write on that side. If the notch is covered or not present, the side becomes read-only. Early floppy drives only wrote on one side of the disk, but it was discovered that both sides had magnetic material, so the diskettes could be flipped and written on, effectively doubling the storage capacity. Later drives had second read/write heads, eliminating the need for flipping. In 3 1/2" diskettes, the write protect function is controlled by a sliding tab, with a closed notch indicating read/write and an open notch indicating write-protect.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the robustness of 8" floppy disks and DECTAPE in the context of computer systems.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the stored value card payment system in Uzbekistan that was used from 2003-2005 to 2010-2012. This system, known as UzKart, was commonly referred to as "offline cards" because it did not require an internet connection to make transactions, unlike "online cards". Users would load money onto their cards at online ATMs or internet-connected terminals and then use the money to make payments at offline terminals. Sellers had their own special offline card called a "merchant's card" and at the end of the day, they would synchronize the transactions from the offline terminal with their bank account. If any payments failed to clear during synchronization, the payer's card would be banned. Initially, offline cards were preferred by merchants due to the expensive and unreliable internet connection, but as mobile internet became cheaper and more widespread, offline cards became less popular.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the payment methods used in Singapore for car parks. It mentions that NETS is the main payment method, but it is transitioning from a contact-based card to a contactless card. Some car parks do not accept the new contactless card, so drivers need to have both types of NETS cards.

## 9. [Scientists use quantum device to slow chemical process by factor of 100B](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37376998)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 Scientists at the University of Sydney have successfully used a quantum computer to slow down a process critical in chemical reactions by a factor of 100 billion times. They observed the interference pattern of a single atom caused by a structure in chemistry called a 'conical intersection'. This breakthrough could have significant implications for materials science, drug design, solar energy harvesting, and understanding how smog is created or how the ozone layer is damaged. Previously, it was not feasible to directly observe these rapid timescales involved in chemical dynamics, but the researchers were able to design an experiment using a trapped-ion quantum computer to slow down the process and make meaningful observations. This experiment provides insight into the ultrafast dynamics of molecules and opens up new possibilities for studying chemical processes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that a factor of 1e11, though large, is often seen in chemistry due to the logarithmic relationship of many phenomena. For instance, the pH scale already covers a range of 14 orders of magnitude.

## 10. [A Gentle Introduction to Liquid Types](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37349276)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses how liquid types can be used to enrich existing type systems and verify semantic properties in code. Liquid types allow for the specification of logical predicates that describe the structure and semantics of program values. By using liquid types, programmers can catch semantic type errors, such as division by zero, at compile-time. Verification of code with liquid types involves subtyping queries and implication checking to ensure that the code satisfies the specifications. Liquid types are a form of refinement types that are dependent on program expressions and use a decidable sublanguage. The use of liquid types allows for more automated type checking and verification of code.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Liquid Types, a feature of Liquid Haskell, can significantly speed up the high-performance parsing of UDP packets. By using Liquid Haskell, the bound checks are shifted from runtime to compile time and are automatically handled by SMT-solvers. This not only helps programmers write correct programs faster but also improves the speed of program execution. The article also mentions that similar approaches to speeding up programs with static analysis can be found in other programming languages like Mojo and Swift.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author highlights that while fancy type systems can guarantee safety in a closed world, they may not be sufficient when dealing with data from external sources. In such cases, a reader or parser with runtime checks is necessary. However, a good type system can provide assurance that these checks are performed once. For monolithic systems, this can lead to significant improvements, but distributed systems (such as microservices) will still require runtime checks to enable each service to have its own lifecycle. The author is curious about how Elixir will handle this issue, considering that Erlang servers divide work into many independent, distributed components.
