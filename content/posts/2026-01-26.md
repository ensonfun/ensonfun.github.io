## 2. [The Hidden Engineering of Runways](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46694193)

**Total comment counts : 2**

### Summary

 September 2025 saw multiple US runway overruns, including an Embraer 145 at Roanoke and two on the same day in Chicago and Boca Raton. In each case, the runway end surfaces crushed under tire weight, yet no fatalities occurred—showing safety systems worked. Grady at Practical Engineering explains runways are highly engineered and costly, balancing safety with price. A primary design decision is runway length, driven by the largest aircraft expected, since longer runways accommodate jets but require land and money. Takeoff/landing performance depends on weight, temperature, elevation, slope, and wind. Wind direction (wind rose) is crucial; planes must face into the wind.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A talk on runway structural design argues that departure stresses are higher and more localized on the runway than arrival stresses because departures repeatedly load the same area, and jets weigh more on departure than on arrival.
- Concern: There is concern about the overall decline in YouTube's recommendation quality, despite this video being notably good.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from praising the video as one of the better YouTube recommendations to criticizing the platform's broader recommendation quality.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 3. [RIP Low-Code 2014-2025](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46767440)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 AI and agentic development threaten low-code platforms, as shipping code costs plummet. While low-code promised to let non-developers build apps and free engineers, AI coding now enables faster, cheaper in-house tooling that matches or outperforms external platforms. The ROI shifts from enabling non-tech users to enabling developers with AI. Cloud Capital illustrates this: they relied on Retool for admin tooling, but moved to standalone, code-based internal tools, migrating away from the platform in a few sprints, despite Retool’s AI push. Incumbents will adapt, but it's unclear if low-code can survive.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Debates about the future of low-code/no-code in the AI era, weighing whether AI-enabled agents will replace them or if platforms will evolve to work with agents via protocols while preserving user visibility and control.
- Concern: Risks include security, privacy, and maintenance burdens, potential bloat or opacity from AI-generated code, and uncertain costs and practicality of relying on AI-driven development.
- Perspectives: Views range from no-code/low-code surviving and evolving with guardrails and direct manipulation, to a merger with agent-centric tooling that shifts complexity to runtimes, with mixed opinions on the claim that the cost of shipping code is approaching zero.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 4. [JuiceSSH – Give me my pro features back](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46768909)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 An article claims JuiceSSH stopped recognizing 2019 purchases after December 2025, raised its price by $20, and that repurchasing may not activate, with unresponsive support suggesting an exit scam. It then describes bypassing the app’s license checks by decompiling the APK and patching multiple functions to always grant pro features, effectively cracking the purchase verification. Tools cited include jadx, ApkTool, jarsigner, and OpenJDK; it advises obtaining a JuiceSSH APK and verifying its hash. It notes cloud sync and plugins likely won’t work after the crack.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on JuiceSSH's current state as an Android SSH client, including pro feature licensing, the loss of cloud sync/backends, and how it compares to newer alternatives.  
- Concern: The main worry is losing access to purchases and features, potential abandonment or lack of developer support, and overall declining viability.  
- Perspectives: Opinions range from frustration over pricing and degraded functionality to preference for and praise of alternative apps like Termius, ConnectBOT, or Android's Terminal, with some hoping the developer is merely busy.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 5. [Dithering – Part 2: The Ordered Dithering](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46770274)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 Part 2 of a visual-dithering guide explains ordered dithering: how threshold maps turn grayscale into two-color black-and-white by using multiple thresholds. To avoid artifacts when tiling, it uses Bayer matrices (2×2, 4×4, 8×8) to produce cross-hatch patterns and more levels, enabling 4, 16, and 64 gray shades for smoother transitions. It also shows alternative arrangements like 8×8 Cluster Dot and Void-and-Cluster. The goal is to mimic grayscale brightness with black-and-white patterns rather than pure thresholds.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Discussion about a ZX Spectrum raytracer that uses ordered dithering to achieve effectively monochrome images, with praise and requests for technical details.  
- Concern: A Chrome loading issue ("Loading assets, please wait...") is noted as a potential usability problem, though Firefox works.  
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic praise and curiosity about the techniques to attention to browser compatibility quirks and links to related posts.  
- Overall sentiment: Mostly positive, with a browser compatibility caveat

## 6. [There is an AI code review bubble](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46766961)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 Greptile argues that the AI code-review market will differentiate on three pillars: independence, autonomy, and feedback loops. They stress separating the review/validation agent from the coding agent, avoid code generation, and foresee a future where code is largely auto-approved with humans writing tickets, while agents create PRs and validate/merge them, looping until acceptance. Their approach favors background automation over UI, letting humans focus on ideas while agents handle cruft. They demonstrate a coordinated loop with Claude Code to link intent, coding, and validation, acknowledging long-term adoption and switching costs.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: AI-based code review tools can find serious bugs but suffer from a poor signal-to-noise ratio and limited practical value, leading to selective use rather than default deployment.
- Concern: The main worry is that these tools generate many speculative issues, fail to outperform human reviews, and may waste time or encourage over-engineering without careful governance.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from skepticism about overall usefulness and vendor differentiation to cautious optimism when integrated into IDEs or workflows, with some seeing potential in AI-powered QA but still needing strong human oversight.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
