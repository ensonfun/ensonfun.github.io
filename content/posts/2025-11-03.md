**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 Facing drought and failed water supply, NYC Fire Department’s Black Saturday Staten Island blaze in 1963 led to the Mack Super Pumper System—a five-truck brigade to fight fires. The centerpiece was a central pumping unit capable of drawing from eight hydrants, pumping from sources, and supplying thousands of lines, at up to 10,000 gpm at low pressure and 8,800 gpm at 350 psi, plus a 600-foot water cannon reach. Power came from a Napier-Deltic diesel (2,400 hp, three cranks, opposed-piston, two-stroke). Mack built it in 1964; it served NYC 1965–early 1980s, handling 2,200+ calls with ~900 firefighters. It cost $875,000.

## 3. [Learning to read Arthur Whitney's C to become smart (2024)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45800777)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 Arthur Whitney’s K language is showcased through a tiny C-based K interpreter (about 50 lines). The article’s author walks through the code, noting unusual C practices: using char* for both strings and numbers, macro-driven control and implicit returns, and heavy use of statement-expressions like ({e;}). Error handling leans on a Q family; nyi means not yet implemented. The code mixes integers and pointers with a 256-threshold “atom” concept and relies on implicit arguments (a, x) and fat-pointers (nx). The piece highlights the intimidating, compact, macro-heavy style, though annotations help demystify it.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion weighs the pros and cons of using heavy C macros and ultra-dense, DSL-like coding styles to express ideas compactly, highlighting both potential benefits and serious maintainability risks.
- Concern: The main worry is that such tricks make code hard to read, debug, and maintain, potentially derailing projects years later.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from veteran C programmers warning against macro abuse to enthusiasts who celebrate dense, expressive macro styles (and related languages like Perl, Python, APL/J) as powerful or beautiful, acknowledging trade-offs and context.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

- Concern: The main worry is potential breaking changes and upgrade pressure from a new major version, along with terminology confusion and questions about alpha release availability.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from excitement about HTMX’s innovation and continued evolution to skepticism about API churn and the library’s competitive position versus alternatives like Datastar.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 10. [The Case Against PGVector](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45798479)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The article argues that while pgvector adds vector search to Postgres, many blogs gloss over production realities. It highlights two index options—IVFFlat and HNSW—and their tradeoffs: IVFFlat requires periodic rebuilds to maintain cluster quality, causing downtime or degraded search; HNSW supports inserts but updates a memory-heavy graph, risking RAM use and contention. In production, continuous data inserts plus normal workload strain the system, forcing choices between full scans, degraded accuracy, or expensive index maintenance. The piece emphasizes the gap between demo success and scalable production use.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion evaluates the viability and tradeoffs of using PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector search in production, including pre- vs post-filtering, index maintenance, and integration versus dedicated vector databases or hybrids.
- Concern: The main worry is that vector indexes can be memory- and time-intensive, with long rebuilds and unpredictable performance during updates, plus concerns about correctness and operational overhead when filtering and scanning across data.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from reports of large-scale production use and recent improvements to skepticism that pgvector is a universal solution, with several alternatives proposed (VectorChord, Redis vector sets, Chroma, AlloyDB) and emphasis on hybrid search, lexical methods (BM25), and business-need-driven tradeoffs.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
