## 3. [Claude Code Is Being Dumbed Down](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46978710)

**Total comment counts : 92**

### Summary

 February 11, 2026 by Yoshi: Claude Code v2.1.20 replaced every file read and search pattern with a single summary line, hiding which files or patterns were used. Users, paying $200/month, want file paths or a toggle. GitHub issues largely demand revert or toggle; Anthropic calls the change a noise-reduction for the majority, a claim unproven. The proposed fix is verbose mode, which dumps thinking traces, subagent transcripts, and full file contents—unhelpful for inline file paths. Over time, verbose mode is pared down but remains unwelcome. A simple boolean toggle would be cheaper than ongoing surgery.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread argues that Claude Code's UX changes mask information and reduce visibility, undermining developer control, even as some praise Codex improvements and call for more configurable, transparent tooling.
- Concern: Hiding file contexts, search patterns, and intermediate thoughts risks harming debugging, workflow management, and user trust.
- Perspectives: Views range from labeling the changes as cynical product management that oversimplifies for non-expert users, to defending experimentation and noting positive Codex/OSS aspects, to urging a more transparent, Unix-like, highly configurable experience.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 7. [Microwave Oven Failure: Spontaneously turned on by its LED display (2024)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46979936)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 Author reports a microwave that randomly powers on lamp, fan, and turntable, mimicking a door-open state. The issue isn’t a failed door switch; it’s an aging LED display causing the microcontroller to falsely sense the door as open. The control circuit uses a single door-detection input (Port H.0) tied to the lower switch with a pull-up and diode isolation; when the microcontroller sees “open,” it energizes the lamp relay, and the same relay also powers the fan/turntable, so all three run even with the door closed. A pressed door lever can flip the lower switch and trigger the triad. The post includes a reverse-engineered schematic and photos.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether a product’s failure-prone behavior is an intentional manufacturing choice (such as an extra diode) rather than an error, while noting strong engineering on the door switches but weaker performance on the display.
- Concern: The main worry is that this design indicates planned unreliability, which could undermine usability and trust.
- Perspectives: Views range from accusing deliberate failure design to praising the door-switch engineering while criticizing the display, with the Hacker News thread cited as context for community reaction.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
