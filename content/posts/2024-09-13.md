## 1. [Notes on OpenAI's new o1 chain-of-thought models](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41527143)

**Total comment counts : 61**

### Summary

 On September 12, 2024, OpenAI unveiled two new models, o1-preview and o1-mini, aimed at enhancing reasoning capabilities over previous models like GPT-4o. These models focus on taking more time to think before responding, utilizing a reinforcement learning approach to improve the "chain of thought" mechanism. This enables them to handle complex prompts by breaking down tasks and refining strategies over time.

While o1 models are designed for deep reasoning and longer response times, models like GPT-4o remain preferable for tasks requiring image inputs or faster responses. A notable feature is the introduction of "reasoning tokens," which enhance performance but remain invisible in API responses, adding a level of complexity in billing and usage. OpenAI recommends limiting extraneous context in retrieval-augmented generation to streamline responses.

Importantly, the reasoning tokens are hidden to maintain model safety and compliance with policy rules, preventing exposure of intermediate thought processes. This decision reflects OpenAI's focus on ensuring user safety and competitive positioning.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The o1-preview model continues to generate incorrect information, such as non-existent libraries and functions, especially for facts not well-represented online. Despite improvements in its reasoning, the model still lacks the ability to verify the accuracy of the information it generates. This leads to repeated mistakes and apologies without resolving the underlying issue.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a quote from OpenAI researcher Jason Wei, highlighting a disconnect between strong results from models like GPT-4o and user experience.
