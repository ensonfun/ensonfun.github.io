### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a new concept for a piano that includes optional subtle light behind each string that illuminates as the hammers strike. The author, a professional pianist, expresses confusion and skepticism about the concept. They believe that while the toy illumination aspect may have some usefulness, replacing the traditional action with solenoids would not be a suitable replacement for the double-escapement action of a modern grand piano. The author emphasizes the importance of the tactile feedback and nuanced feel offered by a well-regulated action in refined pianistic technique. They wish the creators well but doubt the viability and necessity of this innovation, which includes LEDs and solenoids.

## 8. [The Physics of Readability](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37003148)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article "What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory" discusses how memory works in computers and how it affects performance. The paper emphasizes the importance of good memory locality, which refers to storing data together that is commonly accessed together. The author also discusses the concepts of high cohesion and low coupling in programming, where modules should be related to form a coherent whole but have minimal dependencies on other modules. The article suggests that code should be kept small and that redundancy should be avoided to improve code locality. Additionally, the author recommends declaring variables close to their usage and keeping code on a single screen for easier scanning. The article concludes by advocating for inlining functions that are used only once to improve code locality and efficiency.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of functional decomposition in program design. It explains that when every function used once is made open, it can harm readability and the ability to break down a linear process into hierarchical groups of functions. The author argues that functional decomposition is still important and provides an example of a function called only once, suggesting that pulling all the functions into one single initialization function may negatively impact cohesion and coupling.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author finds functions with multiple return statements less readable compared to declaring a return variable at the top of the function, setting its value at multiple points throughout the function, and returning it once at the end.

## 9. [Laniakea Books: Public domain books for everyone](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37012413)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Laniakea Books is a publishing house in London, England, that focuses on publishing public domain books. Public domain books are those where the author has given up all copyrights, allowing anyone to modify, remix, share, or sell these books. The idea behind Laniakea Books is to challenge the notion of intellectual property and instead advocate for free access to intangible creations. They produce both digital and paperback versions of public domain books and distribute them in select London bookstores. The author only pays for printing, while all other work is provided free of charge by Laniakea Books. The company operates within a gift economy, where providing this service is seen as a rational offering. Their first project, "Letters from Prison: On societal freedom," is a collection of texts written by the author for their blog in the past few years. Laniakea Books encourages readers to read, download, pay for, buy a paperback version, or modify the book, as it is considered a gift to the public domain.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the availability of a large number of public domain books online, such as on Gutenberg.org, Archive.org, and standardebooks.org. It mentions that standardebooks.org focuses on enhancing the production and editing of old books, but not in physical print form. The author questions the value of printing hardcopies of these books.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations placed on individuals regarding copyright and the need to acknowledge this issue when discussing policies. It explains that while copyright is meant to fund art and has been successful in that regard, it was designed as a restriction on our natural freedom to share in order to reward creators. The author suggests that as long as copyright remains true to its original purpose, it does not need to have excessively long terms as it does now, and copyright infringement should not be treated as a criminal act in certain countries or trade pacts.

## 10. [Launch HN: GitStart (YC S19) – Remote junior devs working on production PRs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37033753)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 The article discusses GitStart, a platform that recruits developers from remote countries who want to grow their skills. These developers work full-time on tickets and review each other's code. GitStart pays them a base salary and charges clients only if the pull requests are merged. The founder of GitStart had experienced difficulty finding remote work as a junior developer from Pakistan and wanted to provide mentorship and career growth opportunities to junior developers. The platform aims to establish longer-term relationships between junior developers and tech teams to maximize value for both sides. GitStart has faced challenges in securing code sharing but has developed solutions like GitSlice to sync sub-repos with the upstream repo. The article also includes feedback from someone who had experiences with GitStart's PRs, expressing concerns about the quality of the contributions and the use of multiple email addresses. GitStart acknowledges the feedback and apologizes for any mistakes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that there are commercial open source repositories that use GitStart. However, it acknowledges that GitStart has previously submitted unsolicited pull requests to open source projects in an effort to enhance their reputation. The author of the article found these pull requests to be of low quality, typical of junior offshore developers. Dealing with these contributions took up a significant amount of their time to prepare them for merging. It was also observed that a single one-line change commit would have numerous associated email addresses, which was deemed peculiar. Although the article encourages contributions from developers of all levels, it expresses concern that the author's team invested in coaching GitStart's junior developers only for them to take advantage of their efforts for their own benefit. In the end, the author states that they blocked GitStart from their repository.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the idea of using contractors in certain job positions. The author acknowledges concerns within companies about contractors not caring enough. They mention that building trust is important, especially for companies that are resistant to trusting outsiders with production level code. However, they express support for the idea, stating that not enough companies invest in juniors and commend the effort.
