## 4. [Japan enacts law to promote competition in smartphone app stores](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40662176)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 Japan's parliament has passed a law that aims to promote competition in smartphone app stores by restricting Apple and Google from limiting third-party companies from selling and operating apps on their platforms. The law will prevent Apple's iOS and Google's Android from blocking the sale of apps that directly compete with their own platforms. Additionally, the law will prohibit the tech giants from prioritizing their own services in internet search results. Violations of the law will result in penalties of 20% of domestic revenue, which can increase to 30% if the companies continue the anticompetitive practices. The law is expected to take effect by the end of 2025 and follows similar regulation in the European Union.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The law mentioned in the article prohibits Apple and Google from preventing the sale of apps and services that directly compete with their own offerings. This means that Apple cannot block a third-party app that performs a similar function as one of Apple's apps. It is unclear whether the law also requires Apple and Google to allow third-party app stores or if it is mainly focused on allowing apps to process payments directly, bypassing the platforms.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article raises a question about whether certain restrictions mentioned apply only to smartphones and tablets, or if they also apply to other devices with restricted access, such as gaming consoles, media boxes, e-book readers, and others.

## 10. [Banana giant Chiquita held liable by US court for funding paramilitaries](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40646940)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 Chiquita Brands International, a multinational fruit company, has been found liable for financing a Colombian paramilitary group called the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC). The AUC was designated as a terrorist organization by the US at the time. Chiquita has been ordered to pay $38.3 million in damages to eight Colombian families whose relatives were killed by the AUC. The company plans to appeal the verdict, claiming there is no legal basis for the claims. The payments made by Chiquita to the AUC were revealed during a 2007 trial, where the company pleaded guilty to making such payments. The AUC engaged in widespread human rights abuses, including the murder of people suspected of having links with left-wing rebels. The plaintiffs argued that Chiquita formed an alliance with the AUC while expanding its presence in regions controlled by the paramilitary group. The regular payments continued even after the AUC was designated as a foreign terrorist organization. The AUC disbanded in 2006, but some of its members formed new splinter groups that are still active. The lawsuit against Chiquita focused on nine cases, and the jury found the AUC responsible for eight of the murders examined. Chiquita argued that it had no choice but to pay the AUC to protect its employees in Colombia. Another case against Chiquita is set to begin in July.
