## 5. [How to grow professional relationships](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42315946)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's insights into professional relationships through the lens of a model called TJS (The Journey to Synergy) Collaboration Model. Here are the key points:

1. **Background**: The author reflects on experiences with exclusivity and gatekeeping in professional circles, leading to the development of the TJS model to evaluate where professional relationships stand on a spectrum.

2. **The TJS Model**: This model categorizes professional interactions into seven states:
   - **Everything is a Competition**: Characterized by gatekeeping, zero-sum mentality, and exclusionary behaviors like racism or sexism. In the podcast context, this is shown by guests ghosting or declining invitations after receiving a more prestigious one.
   - **Coexist**: Parties acknowledge each other but maintain minimal interaction due to personal, professional, or value differences. On the podcast, this might mean awareness of the show without any desire to participate.

   (The article was cut off before detailing more states, but the spectrum suggests a progression towards more collaborative and inclusive interactions.)

3. **Practical Application**: The author uses their podcast as a practical context to illustrate where interactions fall on this spectrum, from outright refusal to participate, to minimal engagement or acknowledgment without further interaction.

4. **Reflections**: The model isn't just about categorizing relationships but also reflects on how these dynamics influence professional growth and collaboration. It highlights the natural evolution or stagnation of relationships based on mutual understanding and respect.

The article underscores the importance of recognizing where one stands in professional relationships and how these dynamics can either foster growth or perpetuate exclusivity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article offers coding advice related to memory allocation in C. The author congratulates someone on their work but suggests an improvement in the code snippet from "parser.c". Specifically, the author recommends applying the principles of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and not casting the return value of `malloc()`. The original code unnecessarily specifies the type of the pointer, whereas the suggested version simplifies this by using `sizeof *ret`, which is more concise and less error-prone.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the process of building a compiler named `30cc` through a self-compilation method:

1. **Compilation Process**: The script `.build.py` is run, which uses an initial, bootstrapped version of the `30cc` compiler to compile `30cc` itself. This newly compiled version is then used to compile `30cc` again, resulting in a final version of the compiler which is saved as `./30cc`.

2. **Makefile Considerations**: A comment questions why this self-compilation isn't managed by a Makefile, suggesting that the issue might be related to needing different output names for each compilation step, which shouldn't be a significant problem.

3. **Language Constraints**: There's curiosity about whether the author had to limit their use of C features to ensure the compiler could compile itself, or if the compiler naturally supports all the C features used in its own source code.

4. **Compliments**: The comment ends with congratulations and praise for the impressive work on the `30cc` compiler.
