### Summary

 The article discusses a command line tool called "nms" that recreates the data decryption effect seen in the 1992 movie Sneakers.

The tool relies on ANSI/VT100 terminal escape sequences but also provides a ncurses implementation for non-ANSI terminals. The project is available on GitHub and can be installed from source or through package managers on some Unix/Linux platforms. Users can customize the tool by using flags such as enabling auto-decryption, masking space characters, setting foreground color, clearing the screen before printing output, and more. The article also mentions a C library called "LibNMS" that provides a simple interface for using the decryption effect in other projects. The tool is free software under the GNU General Public License.

### Summary

 The Federal Reserve has announced the launch of its new system for instant payments, called the FedNow Service. Banks and credit unions can now sign up to use this tool to instantly transfer money for their customers, at any time of the day. The service aims to make everyday payments faster and more convenient, allowing individuals to receive paychecks instantly and businesses to access funds immediately when an invoice is paid. Currently, 35 banks and credit unions, as well as the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, have early access to the instant payments capabilities of the FedNow Service. In the future, customers of participating banks and credit unions should be able to use their financial institution's mobile app or website to send instant payments securely.

## 7. [Japanese words of Portuguese origin](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36778309)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 This article discusses the influence of Portuguese on the Japanese language during the Muromachi period (15th and 16th centuries). Portuguese Jesuit priests introduced Christian ideas, Western science, technology, and new products to Japan, and they were also the first to establish direct trade between Japan and Europe. The article mentions that Portuguese Jesuits translated Japanese to a Western language, published a Japanese-Portuguese dictionary, and wrote a grammar book. Many Japanese words of Portuguese origin entered the language, particularly referring to products and customs introduced by Portuguese traders. Some of these words are written in kanji or hiragana instead of katakana, which is more commonly used for loanwords in modern Japanese. The article also addresses the misconception that the word "arigatō" (thank you) derives from the Portuguese word "obrigado." Evidence suggests that "arigatō" has a purely Japanese origin. The word originally meant "difficult to exist" or "rare," but its usage shifted over time to express gratitude for receiving outstanding kindness.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author disagrees with the risk ranking matrix provided in the article. They specifically challenge the classification of "Prompt Injections" and "3rd Party LLMs" as medium risk, arguing that the responsibility for fixing vulnerabilities lies with the LLM provider. However, the author disputes this, stating that the responsibility for using a vulnerable third-party component ultimately falls on the user, unless otherwise stated in a contract. They provide an example of a payment information leak caused by a bug in a third-party component used by ChatGPT in Italy. Additionally, the author criticizes the lack of a clear explanation regarding the concept of owning LLMs, noting that there should be a clearer distinction between in-house trained and used LLMs and LLMs trained by third parties but utilized in-house for inference.
