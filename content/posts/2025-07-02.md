## 1. [The Fed says this is a cube of $1M. They're off by half a million](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44435484)

**Total comment counts : 105**

### Summary

 At the Federal Reserve Bank's Money Museum, a cube claims to contain $1,000,000 in $1 bills. The author, skeptical of such displays, attempts to count the bills but struggles. In response, they created Dot Counter, a simple tool for counting items in photos. Upon evaluating the cube, the author finds it may actually contain $1,550,400 due to bundling inconsistencies. They speculate the design might be misleading, questioning if the cube is filled entirely with cash or just a hollow shell. Ultimately, they invite others to verify the count for themselves.
