**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium has successfully sequenced and assembled the complete sequence of a human Y chromosome. The Y chromosome has been difficult to sequence due to its complex repeat structure, resulting in more than half of the Y chromosome being missing from previous reference sequences. The T2T consortium's work corrects errors in the reference sequence and adds over 30 million base pairs of sequence, providing a comprehensive view of the Y chromosome. The assembly includes the complete ampliconic structures of gene families TSPY, DAZ, and RBMY, as well as additional protein-coding genes and an alternating pattern of human satellite blocks. This achievement contributes to a complete and comprehensive reference sequence for all 24 human chromosomes.

## 4. [Higashiyama Atsuki and the “between-legs effect”](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37256077)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 Higashiyama Atsuki, a Japanese researcher, won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2016 for his study on the "between-legs effect," which investigates how viewing things upside down between one's legs affects perception. Higashiyama initially ignored the nomination, thinking it was a prank, but later found out it was true. The Ig Nobel Prize ceremony, held at Harvard University, awarded Higashiyama a clock and prize money of $10 trillion Zimbabwe dollars. Higashiyama's research focuses on the relationship between physical and visual information and how it affects phenomena such as the horizontal-vertical illusion. He discovered that changes in physical position can influence visual perception. For example, when people view objects through their legs, distances and colors appear differently. Higashiyama believes that the importance of physical factors in psychology should not be overlooked and that evidence should be considered in research. Despite receiving criticism for his seemingly dull research, Higashiyama accepted the Ig Nobel Prize to inspire the next generation of researchers. Following his win, he gained more attention and opportunities to present his research. Higashiyama's current project focuses on the perception of body direction and the effect of adapting to it. He finds joy in discussing his research with interested people and continues to collect data and conduct experiments.

## 10. [Naked Mole Rat’s Longevity Gene Gives Mice a Longer Life](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37258143)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Scientists have successfully transferred a gene from naked mole rats into mice, resulting in improved health and longevity in the mice. Naked mole rats are unusual-looking mammals that live in underground colonies and have a longer lifespan compared to similar-sized mice. They also resist age-related diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration. The researchers believe that a molecule called high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HMW-HA) found in naked mole rats holds the key to their longevity. By genetically modifying mice to produce the naked mole rat version of the gene that codes for HMW-HA, the researchers observed increased lifespan, lower cancer rates, reduced inflammation, and healthier guts in the mice. The researchers hope that understanding the mechanisms behind the naked mole rat's longevity could lead to new ways to extend human lifespan and improve health.
