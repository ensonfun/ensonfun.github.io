### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author, a multilingual individual learning Sanskrit, advocates for Krashen's input hypothesis and Orberg's Lingva Latina as effective adult language learning methods. They criticize the grammar translation method as ineffective and time-consuming, arguing that immersive reading, such as daily Sanskrit stories, helps recognize language patterns without needing detailed grammatical understanding. While stories initially provide useful context, the author acknowledges the eventual need to expand vocabulary and grammar for broader conversational comprehension. The article reflects on the multilingual landscape of India, where many people are proficient in several languages.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article praises an initiative aimed at improving language learning but notes that it lacks the guided structure found in platforms like Duolingo. While it acknowledges the overcrowded market of commercial language offers, it suggests that users might benefit from a clear pathway or guidance on what to learn next—such as whether to start with basics or introductions. Providing this direction could facilitate user engagement and enhance the learning experience.

## 2. [Why did Windows 7 log on slower for months if you had a solid color background?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43827214)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The author discusses their preference for a solid color desktop background, which can cause a 30-second delay on the logon screen in Windows 7 due to a failure to report when the desktop is ready. This happens if the system lacks a wallpaper bitmap or if the "Hide desktop icons" group policy is enabled, leading to unnecessary waiting. The issue was resolved shortly after Windows 7's release. The author emphasizes the importance of using default settings for easier bug reporting and shares their experience with Windows development over the years.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses frustrations with setting solid color backgrounds on macOS and GNOME. It notes that macOS defaults to a blinding white screen when attempting custom colors, while GNOME has removed UI controls for solid colors, requiring manual configuration instead. The author criticizes these platforms for inadequately supporting this feature, suggesting a preference for a reliable wallpaper system over unreliable color settings.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on their experience with Microsoft tools after returning to the corporate world, noting recurring issues like Teams not loading due to security problems while still receiving full message notifications. They also highlight the ability to type or paste content in the cloud version of Word before being prompted to set a sensitivity label. This suggests poor software architecture in Microsoft’s web apps, which appears to also affect desktop applications.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The thread discusses the macOS screen recording software, screen.studio, which checks for updates every five minutes. This frequent check is not seen as a bug, but the software's downloading of a 250MB update file every five minutes is problematic, costing the developers $8,000 in bandwidth fees. The author questions the developers' judgment in normalizing such behavior and urges others to consider trust when selecting software.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author criticizes the developers of a screen recording app for their excessive frequency of update checks, suggesting that once a day would be adequate instead of every five minutes.

**Total comment counts : 77**

### Summary

 Aaron Pressman shares his experience of switching from Google Search to the new search engine Kagi after frustrating encounters with misleading search results. He highlights issues with Google's algorithms that prioritize sponsored links and less relevant pages, leading to costly mistakes in obtaining official documents and hotel bookings. Despite Google's efforts to eliminate fraudulent sites, Pressman found that Kagi offers more accurate and relevant results. He recommends Kagi not only for its improved reliability but also for enhanced privacy. Overall, he emphasizes that Kagi surpasses Google in delivering better search results.

They find using the search tool straightforward and effective, focusing on achieving results without hassle. However, they dislike the limitation of the previous trial and have not made objective comparisons to other search engines. Although hesitant about committing to a subscription due to costs, the author is open to upgrading their search experience if it enhances efficiency, especially considering their spending on streaming services.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Kagi is an impressive search engine that allows users to customize search rankings and block certain websites. It delivers relevant results without clutter, passing personal search criteria effectively. However, the user finds it annoying that it displays shopping websites from irrelevant countries in "International" mode, though they recognize this might not be a major issue compared to the difficulties with Google in non-English-speaking regions.

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses the differences between Ancient Greek and modern English speech and writing, highlighting how Ancient Greek orthography captures spoken language more accurately. It examines the frequent use of expletives in English conversation, which can disrupt communication and often appear at key syntactic points. The author argues that translations of Ancient Greek texts often miss the colloquial essence of speech, as demonstrated through student translations of a Xenophon passage. Ultimately, the paper suggests that many Greek particles may be devoid of meaning, reflecting natural speech more than formal writing.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Amazon has stated that it never considered displaying import charges on its main website, according to a report. This decision has sparked discussions regarding transparency in international shipping costs for customers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is concerned that businesses may exploit tariffs to artificially inflate list prices and impose hidden fees at checkout. This practice, seen in industries like dining and telecom, could extend to physical goods if tariffs significantly impact sales. While sales tax is typically excluded from listed prices and widely accepted in the U.S., the fear is that tariffs could lead to similar deceptive pricing strategies, as businesses may avoid directly increasing prices to prevent customer loss.
