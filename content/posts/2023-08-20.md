## 1. [The ReMarkable Streaming Tool v2: Elevating Remote Work Efficiency](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37196440)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The author developed a tool to stream the content of their reMarkable tablet, which was useful for sketching during conference calls. The tool had a slightly cumbersome activation process, so the author aimed to eliminate the need for a local service. They revamped the tool to have a more user-friendly design and improved performance. The tool consists of a server, client, and renderer. The server extracts the picture only when the client is connected, and the client encodes the image in JPEG and adds it to an MJPEG stream. The renderer can read this stream via HTTP. However, this setup requires a specific network topology. To simplify the process, the author eliminated the client and implemented an HTTP server within the server component. They also switched to using a JavaScript client instead of gRPC. The author faced challenges in handling the image size and reducing data transfer, so they used packing techniques and the Run Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm. They also optimized the tool to transmit new frames only when there is a change to reduce CPU usage. The tool is available on GitHub.

## 2. [Shouldn't distant objects appear magnified?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37198954)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article explains the concept of the "Angular diameter distance turnaround" in relation to the expansion of space. It states that as space expands, distant objects appear larger. The article uses the example of galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope that existed 400 million years after the big bang, which would appear as large as galaxies located 2.7 billion light-years away. This effect is due to light traveling longer distances through expanding space, magnifying its apparent size. The article also mentions the redshift of light from distant galaxies, which causes them to appear redder. The "Angular diameter distance turnaround" occurs at a redshift of about 1.5, corresponding to approximately 15 billion light-years away, where objects start to appear larger due to the combined effect of expansion and redshift. The article refers to an xkcd comic that illustrates the concept.

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article describes a study that demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to edit proviral DNA in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected monkeys. The researchers used an AAV9-based vector called EBT-001 to deliver the gene editing tools to target multiple regions of the SIV genome. The results show that a single infusion of EBT-001 led to widespread distribution of the gene editing vector and improved lymphocyte counts in the monkeys. The study supports the potential use of CRISPR-based gene editing as a therapeutic approach for HIV in humans.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a potential cure for HIV using CRISPR technology. However, the effectiveness of CRISPR for gene editing is often limited. The article also raises concerns about whether the method can target the hidden reservoir of HIV in immune cells that are dormant.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Allergy treatments, such as allergy shots and sublingual immunotherapy, can effectively cure allergies. The author shares their personal experience of being cured of severe cat allergies and hay fever through allergy shots, and their son being able to eat peanuts after undergoing sublingual immunotherapy. Treating allergies early in life is found to be more effective and safer, as the immune system is still developing. The author predicts that in the future, it may become standard practice to start infants on sublingual immunotherapy as a preventative measure, potentially eliminating common allergies. Additionally, the introduction of missing factors in our immune systems, possibly through probiotics, could help prevent allergies from developing. The author hopes that this will be the last generation to suffer from high rates of allergies.
