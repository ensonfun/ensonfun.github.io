### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article wants a version of ChatGPT that can be used by their family. They currently pay $20/month for the service, but the most valuable feature, web searching, is only available to paid users. They would be willing to pay a higher amount for a family plan that includes 3-4 users, but not $20/month per person. The author suggests a plan that costs between $30-$40/month for the whole family, as it would be more convenient than sharing a single account.

## 4. [Contra Wirecutter on the IKEA air purifier (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38931559)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 IKEA recently entered the air purifier market, but The Wirecutter is not satisfied with the product. The review by The Wirecutter contains factual errors, misleading statements, and self-contradictory experiments. They criticize the IKEA purifier for not being a true-HEPA purifier, but the term "true-HEPA" has no legal or scientific meaning. The Wirecutter also wrongly refers to the IKEA purifier as using a "PM2.5 filter" which is not a thing. The IKEA purifier actually uses a filter of class E12, while the recommended alternative uses a filter of class H13. However, The Wirecutter fails to provide a reason why H13 is good enough but E12 is not. Air filters do not work like sieves but consist of complicated materials that create a maze of tangled paths for air to pass through. They use mechanisms of impaction/interception and diffusion to catch particles of various sizes, with the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) being around 0.15 microns. Both E12 and H13 filters perform well at blocking very fine particles. The difference between an E12 and an H13 filter is minimal, and the impact of this difference in real-life scenarios may not be significant.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the IKEA STARKVIND air purifier, which comes in regular and table versions. The table version is preferred because it takes up less space, while the regular version is larger and more challenging to place. The standout feature is that the air quality measurements and controls are exposed via Zigbee, making it compatible with Zigbee2MQTT and Home Assistant. The article also mentions the introduction of the VINDSTRYKA air quality sensor by IKEA, although the accuracy of its PM2.5 measurement compared to the STARKVIND is uncertain.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Wirecutter's usage of the term "true-HEPA" to refer to H13 filters. The author questions the logic behind this distinction, as it is the reason Wirecutter dismisses the IKEA purifier. According to the author's referenced Wikipedia page, H13 is considered HEPA, while filters below that grade are categorized as EPA. The author simplifies this by stating that if a filter starts with an H, it is HEPA, and if it starts with an E, it is EPA.

## 5. [The Internet Is Full of AI Dogshit](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38952526)

**Total comment counts : 94**

### Summary

 The internet has become a series of machines communicating with machines, leading to an increase in incorrect or fabricated information. Google's search engine, for example, has been providing incorrect information due to its new practice of displaying snapshots of pages in search results without verifying their accuracy. Additionally, an individual on Twitter claimed to have performed an internet traffic "heist" by using AI to write articles based on a competitor's website. Sports Illustrated was also caught publishing articles that were supposedly authored by AI, only to later claim they were written by third parties using pseudonyms. This shift towards machine-to-machine communication has broken the internet as a reliable source of information, and those responsible for content are more interested in gaming search results and ad revenue than providing accurate information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the rise of AI-generated text has impacted the filtering of online posts. Previously, poor spelling and grammar served as an indicator of low-quality content, allowing users to quickly disregard such posts. However, AI-generated text now possesses impeccable language skills, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake content. This has led to challenges in various contexts, as exemplified by curl's struggle with bogus AI-generated bug reports. The article suggests that this issue will worsen over time, potentially making it impossible to effectively separate valuable content from useless content.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author argues that while they agree with the idea that the internet has changed significantly with the development of AI language models like GPTs, they believe that the quality of content created by humans is already similar to what AI generates. They also claim that people are using apps more than web browsers, and that the web has been of poor quality for a long time. The author suggests that if the web is to continue, it should move to a new, anonymized layer and require payment for content to discourage low-quality material. They emphasize that the volume of spam on the web has significantly increased.

## 6. [Outlook is Microsoft's new data collection service](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38953618)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Microsoft's new Outlook for Windows has transformed into a surveillance tool for targeted advertising. European users are informed that Microsoft and 772 third parties use their data for various purposes, including advertising. The article highlights that Americans are not informed about this data collection due to the lack of privacy legislation in the country. The new Outlook also allows users to choose how their data is used, but privacy policies are often difficult to understand and give companies the freedom to sell personal data to third-party advertisers. Additionally, syncing third-party email accounts with the new Outlook gives Microsoft access to credentials and emails associated with those accounts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the amount of information Microsoft gathers through data collection and how it provides insights into various industries, including their competitors. The author questions why Microsoft, despite having access to such data, is still struggling as a company. The article also highlights the blind trust that companies place in Microsoft, requiring employees to share personal data. The author expresses concerns about the excessive leakage of company, employee, and customer data to Microsoft, but doubts that anything will change unless the corporation personally experiences the misuse of data or faces legal consequences.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a potential business model that involves using AI models to analyze corporate customer emails and generate commercially interesting content. The model would produce emails that are coincidentally similar to the sensitive information in the training data set. The author suggests that Microsoft has the necessary resources to implement this model but assures readers that they would never engage in such unethical practices.

## 7. [High C Compiler – A C language extension ahead of its time](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38938402)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 This article discusses the interesting features and extensions found in the High C Compiler, which was used for the FM TOWNS platform in the 1980s. The compiler had various language extensions that were not seen in other C compilers at the time, and some have still not been adopted in standard C or C++. These extensions include the ability to write long numeric literals with separators, labeling arguments in function calls, matching a range of values, nesting functions inside other functions, using nonescaping closures, and implementing Python-style generator coroutines. Overall, the article highlights the unique and advanced features of the High C Compiler.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The High C Compiler was created by Frank deRemer and Tom Pennello, the inventors of LALR2 parsing. The author worked with them in the early 90s and remembers Tom's impressive coding skills. They credit these computer scientists for giving them their start in the software industry.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their love for named parameters in programming languages like Python and Swift. They find them to be more readable and simpler compared to languages like C or JavaScript that do not have this feature. The author wonders why named parameters are not more commonly implemented in other languages like TypeScript and questions if the difficulty of implementation or interoperability issues are the reasons. They also wonder if the lack of popularity of these features may be due to not many people finding them appealing. The author acknowledges that named parameters can be emulated using objects in JavaScript/TypeScript but mentions performance consequences that can be good in some situations and terrible in others.

### Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author predicts that within twenty years, Bitcoin will become fully institutionalized. This means that the "Bitcoin" held by investors will be disconnected from the theoretical blockchain. Similar to how stocks used to be physical pieces of paper, Bitcoin will undergo a similar transformation. The author uses the example of trading physical stock certificates and how they have become separate from modern trading systems. In 2050, if someone wants to sell their actual Bitcoin on the chain, they will have to go through a separate process involving compliance and verification.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article criticizes a music software that uses a piano roll instead of traditional music notation. The author finds it problematic that the software offers tools for complex musical concepts like key signatures, modes, and microtonal music, but lacks basic functionalities like reorganizing song sections and proper representation of scales. The author also points out that the software does not provide the option for using flats, only sharps, which can make reading music more difficult. Overall, the author sees the tool as interesting for experimenting with scales and tunings, but not suitable for composing music.
