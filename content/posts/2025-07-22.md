## 10. [“Dynamic programming” is not referring to “computer programming”](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44603349)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 The term "Dynamic Programming," coined by Richard Bellman in the 1950s, refers to the planning of sequential steps for solving problems, rather than computing in the software context. It compares to scheduling for constructing a building where each task depends on previous ones. In computer science, it involves organizing computations (like Fibonacci numbers) in a way that ensures efficiency, either through a top-down or bottom-up approach. Bellman chose the name to avoid negative connotations, as he faced constraints on using terms like "research" during his work at the RAND Corporation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 A former Sri Lankan competitor in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) recalls his experiences in the '90s. Despite excelling nationally, he initially failed to win a medal internationally due to a lack of knowledge in dynamic programming. After a year of research, he discovered that it combined recursion with result storage. With this newfound understanding, he successfully won a gold medal at the IOI in 2001.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The origin of the term "Dynamic Programming" is debated. According to Wikipedia, Russell and Norvig argue that it cannot be entirely accurate as Bellman's first paper mentioning the term predates Wilson's appointment as Secretary of Defense. Conversely, Harold J. Kushner noted that Bellman claimed he aimed to enhance Dantzig's linear programming by incorporating "dynamic" elements. Thus, both motivations for the term's creation may hold validity.
