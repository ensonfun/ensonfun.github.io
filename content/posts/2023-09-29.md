### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the company PostHog asks its users where they heard about the company when they sign up or book a demo. Many users mention that they found out about PostHog through advertisements on Google. However, the author argues that while ads may make people aware of something, they are generally not convincing enough to make people try a product or service. The author personally prefers positive discussions in technical spaces to motivate them to try a product, rather than advertisements.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article provides tips and insights for running successful paid ads. The main points are as follows:

1. Ensure that your product is ready before starting paid ads. It's essential to have a compelling product that can convince users to stay and explore further.

2. Focus not only on the quality of your ads but also on the onboarding flows that users encounter after clicking. Poor onboarding flows can negatively affect conversions.

3. Familiarize yourself with basic ad terminology and monitor vital statistics closely. Don't assume that an ad expert or agency has everything under control, especially in the early stages of your startup.

4. Start by focusing on conversion keywords rather than broad match or branded keywords. This approach can help you establish the basics of your ad operation and attract higher-quality traffic.

5. Be cautious when dealing with ad platforms and their representatives. Don't rely on auto-optimization options and set tight spend limits to avoid overspending. Plug leaks by disallowing certain apps and scammy sites in display ads.

6. The author recommends reading posts on the r/PPC subreddit, particularly older posts with high ratings, to learn from other people's mistakes in the PPC realm.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Microsoft's response to an incident involving abuse of tokens in their Outlook Web App (OWA). The mitigation and hardening measures taken by Microsoft include the following:

- On June 26, OWA stopped accepting tokens issued from GetAccessTokensForResource for renewal to prevent token renewal abuse.
- On June 27, Microsoft blocked the usage of tokens signed with the acquired MSA (Microsoft Account) key in OWA, thereby preventing further malicious activity.
- On June 29, Microsoft replaced the key to prevent the threat actor from using it to forge tokens. They also revoked all MSA signing keys, including the one acquired by the threat actor.
- The new MSA signing keys are issued in updated systems that have increased isolation from corporate environments, refined monitoring, automated alerting, and are stored in the key store used for enterprise systems.
- On July 3, Microsoft blocked the key usage for all impacted consumer customers to prevent the use of previously-issued tokens.

While these measures are designed to address the issue, it is important to note that their effectiveness may still depend on the nature of the threat and any potential vulnerabilities that may exist within the system.

## 5. [JAX – NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37698740)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article provides an introduction to JAX, which is a library that allows for high-performance machine learning research on the CPU, GPU, and TPU. JAX can automatically differentiate native Python and NumPy code and supports reverse-mode as well as forward-mode differentiation. It uses XLA to compile and run NumPy code on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. JAX also offers program transformations such as jit() for speeding up code, grad() for taking derivatives, and vmap() for automatic vectorization or batching. The article provides examples and explains how these transformations can be composed and used together. The article concludes by expressing excitement about the capabilities of JAX.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that Jax, originally developed for machine learning research, is a promising tool for scientific computing. Jax's capability to easily run computations on GPU or TPU through its integration with XLA makes it favorable for large-scale vectorized scientific computations. The author compares their experience in astronomy simulations a decade ago, where simulations were primarily on CPU, and the complexity involved in using more specialized chips. However, with Jax, they highlight the convenience of coding simulations using numpy, which can run on a GPU with a significant speed boost. The author believes that despite these advantages, the scientific community has yet to widely adopt Jax.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author finds JAX to be cool but takes issue with its claim as being "numpy on the GPU" compared to PyTorch, as there is a fundamental difference between the two. The main difference is that JAX is functional, whereas numpy and PyTorch are not. The author points out that while numpy allows directly setting a value in an array with `x[0] = 10`, JAX requires using the `x.at[0].set(10)` syntax instead. The author believes that this fundamental change in how operations are performed makes it inaccurate to claim JAX as a drop-in replacement for numpy. In this regard, the author believes that PyTorch is closer to numpy than JAX.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the idea that playful teasing may serve a defensive role similar to dares. It suggests that both activities provoke certain socially healthy reactions and the absence of such reactions could indicate negative traits, such as psychopathy or narcissism. The article includes references to Pieter Hintjens and other research.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author argues that descriptions of play as either aggressive or non-aggressive are incomplete because they fail to consider the element of conflict in our emotions. The author suggests that play involves a mixture of sub-emotions, including aggression, attraction, and need. They argue that engaging in play as an opponent or being selfish is about finding a balance between these conflicting emotions. The author concludes by stating that our emotions are in constant conflict, and we exist as a balance or imbalance of these emotions.
