### Summary

 The article describes gpt-prompt-engineer, a tool that generates, tests, and ranks prompts for prompt engineering. The tool is based on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo and uses an ELO rating system to rank the prompts. The gpt-prompt-engineer -- Classification Version notebook is designed to handle classification tasks. The test cases should be in the format of choosing how many prompts to generate, and the results are shown in a descending order, with higher-rated prompts being better.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a tool that uses GPT4 to rank prompts based on how well it imagines they will perform, instead of how a model actually responds to them. However, this method lacks a ground truth against actual responses, making it uncertain if the chosen 'best prompt' is actually the best. The popularity of this method among AI developers may be due to their fascination with LLMs evaluating LLMs, but the author warns that there are no shortcuts to evaluating performance in real-world applications.
