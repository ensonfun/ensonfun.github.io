## 1. [Goodbye integers, hello UUIDv7](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37733036)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The article discusses the adoption of UUIDv7 as the primary key choice for Buildkite, a company specializing in CI/CD tools. UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are unique identifiers that can be generated independently. They have gained popularity as database keys, especially in distributed environments. However, the random nature of standard non-time-ordered UUIDs can lead to poor database index performance. To address this issue, Buildkite previously standardized the use of sequential integer IDs as primary keys but encountered performance issues. The article explores the advantages and disadvantages of different identifier types and introduces UUIDv7, a time-ordered UUID that solves the index locality problem. Buildkite observed a significant reduction in WAL rate and write IO when switching to UUIDv7. The article also explains the compatibility and practical use of UUIDv7. Buildkite has decided to use UUIDv7 as the primary key for all new tables, eliminating the need for coordination and simplifying application logic. The article concludes with future considerations, including the potential use of UUIDv8 for incorporating shard numbers into identifiers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that while using ordered keys can be useful for internal distributed systems, they should not be used as public identifiers due to potential security and business implications. Leaking time information from systems can pose risks such as knowing when session tokens or accounts are created.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the topic of random IDs and their impact on performance in distributed storage systems. Contrary to the belief that random IDs are bad for performance, it argues that they are actually better because they prevent hotspots on a single node. The article provides references to further explore this topic.

## 3. [What every software developer must know about Unicode in 2023](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37735801)

**Total comment counts : 81**

### Summary

 The article discusses the importance of understanding Unicode and UTF-8 encoding in programming. It explains how Unicode is a standard that assigns unique numbers to different characters and how UTF-8 is an encoding that stores code points in memory. The article emphasizes the concept of extended grapheme clusters, which are sequences of code points that should be treated as a single character. It also highlights the need for normalization to handle variations in character representations. The author encourages using proper Unicode libraries and staying updated with Unicode standards to ensure accurate handling of text. The article concludes with a discussion on the limitations and challenges of Unicode but acknowledges its significance in modern programming.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 I'm sorry, but as a text-based AI, I am unable to access or summarize content from specific links. However, if you can provide the text of the article, I would be more than happy to assist you in summarizing it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author disagrees with the idea that "extended grapheme clusters" are the only correct way to interpret characters in Unicode. They argue that there are different definitions of "characters" depending on the specific use case. Extended grapheme clusters may not accurately represent factors such as display size or deletions in a monospace font. The author suggests that codepoint iteration should be used for string iteration because it aligns with the fundamental level of Unicode and allows for different algorithms depending on specific needs. They reference another article that explains why extended grapheme clusters may not be the right approach.

## 4. [Nobel Prize in Medicine awarded to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37736035)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article recounts the author's experience working at a dial-up internet service provider during the late 90s.

However, the company over-projected its growth, leading to financial troubles. The author's employer, a larger ISP, acquired the struggling company to gain customers and maintain its relationship with the telecommunications company. The author was tasked with handling customer service calls after many employees were laid off. The company faced various issues, including leaked user accounts and mysterious billing complaints. Despite a dysfunctional environment, the author gained perspective on excellence and the consequences of dysfunction. The story concludes with the author's departure from the company and reflections on the experience.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights various examples of inefficient and outdated practices still prevalent in small and medium-sized businesses. One business stores numerous word documents containing customer details, invoices, etc., in a single folder. To create a new invoice, they copy an old one and modify it, saving it with a new name using a changing system. Another business used to perform all accounting tasks manually, with an elderly woman manually operating a calculator for hundreds or thousands of transactions, which took several days. Lastly, a small business relied on a small black book filled with disorganized and undated notes, containing a mixture of cash and card transactions. Despite their chaotic operational methods, they somehow maintained a good reputation locally.

## 10. [Eye comfort a priority for all-in-one desktop PC with color E Ink display](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37701613)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 Bigme has launched the B251 all-in-one Windows PC on Kickstarter, featuring a 25.3-inch color E Ink display with 3,200 x 1,800 resolution. The display is designed to reduce eye strain and offers a refresh technology to minimize ghosting and lag. The PC is equipped with 12th Gen Intel i5 processor, 16 GB of RAM, and 1 TB of storage. It also includes various ports for connectivity and has a built-in voice control system and dual-channel speakers. The Kickstarter campaign offers a discounted price, with shipping estimated to start from December.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses E Ink's Kaleido display, which utilizes colored subpixels to create color. However, reflective screens with subpixels result in dark images and low contrast compared to paper. For example, to display a red image, the screen turns the green and blue subpixels black, resulting in a large portion of the screen being black and only one third being red. Similarly, to display white, the subpixels cannot turn white, so they combine red, green, and blue to create a white appearance. This makes the colored Kaleido screen much darker compared to white paper. The article suggests that to achieve acceptable contrast in a color e-paper screen, a display technology that can change colors within the pixels is needed. Although E Ink has this technology, it is slow and offers only a limited range of colors.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article raises skepticism about the authenticity of a 25.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink screen, as the largest size mentioned on E Ink's official website is 13.3-inch. Furthermore, the article highlights that such screens do not have a ~60 Hz refresh rate as shown in the mockup video.
