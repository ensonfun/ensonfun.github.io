## 4. [Type 1 diabetes reversed by new cell transplantation technique](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43160582)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses a breakthrough in managing type 1 diabetes through a preclinical study conducted by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine. Here are the key points:

- **Innovative Approach**: Researchers have developed a method where insulin-producing pancreatic islets are transplanted along with engineered blood-vessel-forming cells (R-VECs) to better mimic the natural environment of the pancreas.

- **Procedure**: Traditionally, islets are transplanted into the liver, but this new method involves placing the islets under the skin, a less invasive site. This approach aims to reduce the risk of islet loss due to inflammation, lack of oxygen, and immune response.

- **Results**: In experiments with diabetic mice, the co-transplantation of human islets and R-VECs under the skin led to the formation of a vascular network around the islets. This allowed the islets to survive and function long-term, producing insulin in response to glucose and normalizing blood sugar levels for over 20 weeks.

- **Significance**: This method could potentially provide a durable, safe treatment option for type 1 diabetes, reducing the need for long-term immunosuppression and making the treatment less invasive.

- **Future Steps**: Before this can be applied to humans, further preclinical trials are needed to confirm safety and efficacy. Challenges include scaling up the production of vascularized islets and managing immune responses without heavy immunosuppression.

The study's findings suggest a promising future for type 1 diabetes treatment, potentially leading to a cure if further research and trials are successful.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that the NIH (National Institutes of Health) has funded groundbreaking research. However, it expresses concern over potential losses in research due to what is described as arbitrary cuts or reductions in funding, metaphorically referred to as "slashing and burning and purging."

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of immunosuppressant drugs to prevent rejection in islet cell transplantation for type 1 diabetes. It points out that these drugs are required long-term, which significantly reduces quality of life, making this treatment option less favorable compared to insulin therapy. Consequently, pancreas or islet transplants are typically reserved for type 1 diabetics who are already on immunosuppressants for other reasons.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses **3FS (Three File System)**, a specialized file system designed for AI model training which involves extensive random reads. Here are the key points:

- **Origin**: 3FS was developed by a company that has been using it for several years, with initial design details published in Chinese on their blog.

- **Purpose and Design**: Unlike traditional file systems, 3FS is optimized for scenarios where data is read in large, random batches during AI training. It omits conventional optimizations like read caching and prefetching because these are ineffective for its use case where data is accessed randomly and not reused immediately.

- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - 3FS uses Linux-based Asynchronous I/O (AIO) and `io_uring` interfaces for efficient data reading.
  - File Cache is disabled to avoid unnecessary memory consumption since caching does not help in its scenario. Instead, Direct I/O mode is used, which requires alignment of buffer pointers, offsets, and lengths to avoid additional memory copies. This alignment is managed internally by 3FS to enhance performance and user convenience.

- **Performance**: By removing features like read caching, 3FS aims to improve performance specifically for the high-speed computing and storage interactions needed in AI training environments.
