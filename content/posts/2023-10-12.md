## 4. [Metric Time](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37853181)

**Total comment counts : 82**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of metric time and its advantages over traditional time systems. Metric time is based on a base-10 system, making calculations and conversions between timezones easier. There are no AM or PM distinctions in metric time, with just 10 hours in a day. For example, getting a good night's sleep of 8 standard hours would be 3.33 metric hours. The article also explains that a half hour in metric time is equivalent to 50 minutes, while a full hour is 100 minutes. The logic used to tell time with metric time is similar to thinking about money, with each metric hour being akin to a 100-dollar bill. Each day in metric time consists of 1,000 minutes and 100,000 seconds. Overall, metric time offers an interesting perspective on how we spend our time each day.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of decimal time, also known as French Revolutionary Time. The author created their own version of decimal time that eliminates time zones. The numeric time remains the same globally, but the display changes based on location, aligning with local solar midday and midnight. The clock also includes day and night hours on its face. The author's version used to integrate with Google Calendar but hasn't been updated due to changes in the Google Calendar API. Additionally, the author introduces a metric week with new week days, eliminating the need for months. The article concludes by stating that time and date calculations become simpler with decimal time.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a hypothetical scenario where time is measured in a metric system. It mentions the confusion that arises when trying to convert traditional time measurements to metric time. The author notes that despite the expectation of waking up at 12:83 or 2:83, the metric time is stated as 2:75. The article also highlights the use of continuing fractions in traditional time measurements, such as the 60-minute hour and 24-hour day, as a way to accommodate various factors.

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of Raspberry Pi hardware to capture time-lapse images of the night sky. The author describes their interest in capturing images of meteors and their decision to build a custom all-sky camera based on the Raspberry Pi. They explain the components required for the camera setup, including the Raspberry Pi microcomputer, the Raspberry Pi High Quality camera, a lens, and a waterproof enclosure. The author also mentions the Allsky Camera project and the Global Meteor Network, which both utilize Raspberry Pi-based cameras to observe the night sky and contribute data for meteor research. The author shares their experience setting up the camera and adjusting the various settings to capture high-quality images. They also express their excitement about the possibility of capturing meteors in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article offers several tips for photography. Firstly, it suggests placing a better perch for birds to avoid scratches on the camera. Secondly, it recommends using auto-focus cameras or adding heaters for temperature-dependent manual focus cameras. Additionally, it notes that taking photos in very cold weather can improve long-exposure low-light shots due to reduced charge leakage in the sensor. However, condensation should be considered when keeping the sensor cold. Lastly, the article mentions that long exposures may lead to device pixel-specific noise, but this can be mitigated by creating a dark view map at a specific temperature and using it to denoise the images. Multiple frames or a shutter are recommended to capture the "darkest sample."

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article suggests that while Raspberry Pi cameras may appear to be a cost-effective choice for building an all sky camera system, the effort involved in building, installing, and maintaining one outweighs the savings. The author recommends using a better camera from ZWO, specifically the ASI462MC or ASI462MM, which are priced at around $300. The ZWO camera comes with an all sky lens and offers better performance for meteor detection. The author explains that due to light pollution and their proximity to an airport, the color camera did not perform well for meteor detection. As a result, the author built a second monochrome version, which is more sensitive and provides better results with shorter exposure times. However, even with the monochrome camera, exposure times of a few seconds are still required. As a result, the author now uses both cameras for 20-second exposures, and the monochrome camera is particularly good at capturing the Milky Way in their specific sky conditions.

## 10. [The Hard Economics of Selling Web Data](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37842904)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of selling web-scraped data and why companies often hire consultants instead of buying pre-scraped data. It explains that pricing datasets can be difficult due to limited liquidity and the cost considerations of buyers. To solve this issue, the article suggests using a marketplace model, where buyers can easily find and purchase data from multiple sellers. The marketplace model lowers transaction costs for buyers and allows sellers to reach a wider audience. The article concludes by stating that consumption-based pricing is ideal for aligning the interests of buyers and sellers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of using purchased data and the benefits of building a scraper to gather specific and reliable data. The author shares their experience of using off-the-shelf scraping products, which proved to be of poor quality. They eventually built their own scraper which was accurate, reliable, and cost-effective. This capability not only improved their services but also helped with sales approaches. The author emphasizes the importance of having control over and understanding the software, as it allowed them to quickly add new capabilities as needed. They also highlight the need for discretion when engaging in scraping activities to avoid legal consequences. The article concludes by acknowledging that while there may be valid reasons to purchase data, building a scraper was a more suitable choice in this specific case.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the legality of selling scraped data from large websites like Google, Amazon, and Craigslist. It states that directly selling copyrighted data from these websites in a marketplace is likely to result in legal action. Instead, companies that want their data scraped typically offer an API or are open to selling the data or access to the API. As a result, people often hire others, use proxies, and store the scraped data in their own internal databases to avoid being easily identified and targeted by these companies. However, the article also mentions that there are some companies that sell processed data, analyzed by data analysts, which can have successful and lucrative business models.
