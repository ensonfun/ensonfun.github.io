## 1. [Markov chains are funnier than LLMs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41286203)

**Total comment counts : 61**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of predictability machines and their connection to humor. It compares a Markov chain, a type of statistical model, to ChatGPT 3.5, a large language model (LLM), and examines their ability to generate humorous content. The author explains that while LLMs like ChatGPT are more advanced and accurate in generating desired outputs, Markov chains can be funny despite their simplicity. The article defines humor as "unserious surprise" and emphasizes the importance of unexpected elements in jokes. It also explores techniques such as violating patterns and using descriptive language to strengthen the "snap" or surprise factor in humor. The author highlights the parallel between good joke writing and good writing in general, and acknowledges that humor is subjective and depends on individual preferences and cultural norms.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recounts their experience working on a project where they generated fake AWS blog posts using a markov chain generator. They found it to be amusing because the generated text was nonsensical. However, when they tried using GPT, a more advanced language model, the generated posts were too realistic to be entertaining. They concluded that modern language models are capable of generating text that may be incorrect but lacks the humorous aspect of nonsensical markov chain content.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the theme of Markov chains being funnier than large language models, and the author asks for 10 jokes on this theme. Claude responds with the following jokes:

1. Why did the Markov chain cross the road? To get to the other side of unpredictability.
2. An LLM and a Markov chain walk into a bar. The LLM orders a statistically probable drink. The Markov chain orders a lampshade made of cheese.
3. What do you call a Markov chain that tells dad jokes? A Mark-ov Twain.
4. How many LLMs does it take to screw in a lightbulb? One - but it'll spend 20 minutes explaining the optimal lightbulb-screwing process first.
5. Knock knock. Who's there? Markov. Markov who? Markov chain reaction of nonsensical hilarity.
6. An LLM, a Markov chain, and GPT-4 walk into a bar. The bartender says "We don't serve your kind here." GPT-4 leaves. The LLM stays to debate ethics. The Markov chain orders a bicycle made of spaghetti.
7. What's an LLM's favorite movie? Predictable and Furious 17: The Safest Driving Yet.
8. How does a Markov chain tell a story? "Once upon a time, there was a princess who lived in a castle made of bananas and ruled over a kingdom of sentient toasters."
9. What did the Markov chain say to the LLM? "Your mother was an abacus and your father smelled of silicon!"
10. Why don't Markov chains make good therapists? Because their advice is always "And then you should banana the feelings until they become a hat."

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The article highlights the continuous growth and scale of the gaming platform Roblox. Despite the contraction of the gaming industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, Roblox has seen a significant increase in its user base. On an average day, over 80 million people log onto Roblox, surpassing the numbers seen on platforms like Second Life. The platform currently has more than 380 million monthly users, twice as many as PC gaming leader Steam and three times that of PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. Roblox is also one of the most played games on PlayStation and Xbox. The platform has about five times more monthly players than Minecraft and 2.25 times more than Fortnite. In terms of user engagement, players spend close to six billion hours on Roblox every month. This is significantly higher than the average watch time on Disney+ and emphasizes the platform's popularity. Roblox's growth has been consistent and resilient, maintaining its accelerated rate of growth even after the pandemic. The user base has also become more diverse, with a higher percentage of users over the age of 13, and a surge in users from APAC and ROW regions. Despite the diversification, revenues per user have increased, and annual spending on Roblox is over $3.8 billion, with a quarter of the revenue going to developers. Overall, Roblox continues to appeal to a global audience, expand its user base, and increase monetization.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author's child has spent over $500 on Roblox using gift cards and chores. They dislike that many games on the platform have a "pay to win" aspect or excessive advertising. The author tries to introduce their child to better games that are not free, but their friends can't play them. This motivates the child to continue playing and wanting more Robux, especially when their favorite YouTubers are playing. The author questions why Roblox is not being investigated for predatory practices, although they acknowledge that users create most of the mini-games on the platform and Roblox simply provides the platform.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Roblox, although not profitable, has strong operating cash flow, which is a more important measure than accounting-defined profits. In the past twelve months, the company's operating cash flow was $650 million, accounting for about 20% of its revenue. Roblox has remained cash-positive for at least twenty-four quarters. This highlights the phenomenon where companies like Roblox prioritize increasing cash flow over immediate profitability. If the cash flow ever stops increasing, they can adjust by reducing reinvestment spending to maintain sustainability.

The project includes an authentication library for iCloud and hard codes a MacBook device agent to associate generated keys with a device. The article warns against using this on an account with many services or digital assets, as it may result in Apple banning the account. The unique "adsid" code required for login could easily identify if this project is being used.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article proposes a concept that could potentially be used to bypass the stalking features implemented by Apple and other companies. The concept involves using multiple donor tags that cycle through different tags every 24/N hours. This would make it difficult for Apple or any device tracking system to follow a person continuously using a single tag.

## 6. [The Quantum Butterfly Effect](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41253409)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Scientists at Los Alamos have discovered that quantum-level disruptions can be controlled and do not spiral out of control over time. They found that it is possible to take a particle in a specific quantum state back in time and modify its state in the past without significantly changing it in the present. This contradicts the butterfly effect, which suggests that small changes can lead to large effects. The butterfly effect can be understood in two ways: chaotic behavior in complex systems and amplification of small changes over time. The scientists have worked out the quantum analogues of both versions and found that quantum chaos is not immediately apparent in the equations of quantum physics. Classical physics allows for chaotic behavior, but quantum physics describes particles as diffuse entities with wave properties. However, studying chaotic behavior in the quantum realm often involves accounting for non-pristine systems, such as considering the influence of stray radio waves or magnetic fields on quantum objects.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that reality has an error-correction mechanism where small disturbances are smoothed out at a larger scale.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The user is requesting a summary of an article that does not appear to have any citations. They are questioning if the article contains pre-published findings from Los Alamos lab.

## 7. [Parsing protobuf at 2+GB/s: how I learned to love tail calls in C (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41289114)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The Clang compiler has added a new feature that allows guaranteed tail calls in C, C++, and Objective-C using the `[[clang::musttail]]` or `__attribute__((musttail))` attributes. Tail calls are often associated with functional programming, but they can also improve performance. The article mentions that using tail calls in protobuf parsing has resulted in significant speed improvements. The author believes that major language interpreters written in C could also benefit from this technique. However, there is a downside in terms of portability as `musttail` is currently a nonstandard compiler extension. The article explains what tail calls are, their benefits, and how they optimize stack memory and reduce the performance overhead of function calls. The author also mentions that tail call optimization is not new to Clang, but the new feature guarantees the optimization in all build modes. The article concludes by referencing Mike Pall, the author of LuaJIT, who wrote LuaJIT's interpreter in assembly instead of C to achieve better performance, highlighting the challenges that C compilers face with interpreter main loops.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes a proposal for a C standard for tail call optimization. The proposal suggests using "return goto (expression);" instead of standardizing the "musttail" feature. This method guarantees that the lifetimes of local objects will end, making it easier to implement without extensive escape analysis. A link to the proposal is provided for more information.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions an old RFC (Request for Comments) in the Rust programming language community that proposed adding a "become" keyword to guarantee Tail Call Optimization (TCO). This proposal was originally postponed to focus on other goals, but it has recently been revisited. The article shares links to the original RFC and the recent revisiting of the initiative.

## 8. [Seven basic rules for causal inference](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41263928)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses seven basic rules that govern the relationship between causal mechanisms and the associations or correlations observed in data. These rules serve as building blocks for causal inference. The rules are explained using causal graphs and logic terms, and simple simulation R code is provided to demonstrate their practical application. The four elemental building blocks of causal graphs are described, including chain paths, fork paths, collider paths, and causally independent variables. The article also discusses the correlation between variables, the role of common ancestors and descendants, and the importance of randomization in experimental control. Adjustment, or controlling for variables, is also explained as a means of analyzing relationships in data.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of collider bias in research studies and emphasizes the importance of controlling for a collider variable in order to obtain accurate results. Collider bias occurs when an independent variable has a common effect on both the dependent variable and another independent variable, leading to a spurious correlation. The article suggests that researchers should consult subject matter experts and develop a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to explicitly outline the causal assumptions. By doing so, it becomes easier for other researchers to propose alternative causal structures and test the robustness of the results. The article also mentions the DAGitty tool as a helpful resource for creating DAGs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of correlation between independent and dependent variables. It states that while independent variables can be not correlated, it is important to note that dependent variables can also be not correlated. The example given is of a dependent variable, Y, which is determined by the value of an independent variable, X. Despite this relationship, the correlation between X and Y is zero.

## 10. [NASA acknowledges it cannot quantify risk of Starliner propulsion issues](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41285046)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 NASA is still unsure whether to bring two astronauts back to Earth on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft or extend their stay on the International Space Station due to safety concerns. The Starliner has experienced issues such as suspect thrusters and helium leaks, and it needs to depart the space station before SpaceX's next Dragon crew mission. NASA officials had expected to make a decision this week, but it is now likely to be made at the end of next week or the beginning of the week of August 26. The thruster issue is being investigated by propulsion experts, as five of Starliner's thrusters failed during approach to the space station. While most of the thrusters have recovered, engineers are uncertain whether they will work normally on the journey back to Earth.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is a comment from a retired engineer who worked on the Transfer Orbit Stage (TOS) developed by Orbital Sciences and Lockheed Martin for NASA/MSFC in the 1990's. The retired engineer discusses potential issues with the RCS thruster thermal problem.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author, a fan of SpaceX, acknowledges their success in space exploration but emphasizes the need for multiple reliable launch and crew providers for safety and sustainability. While SpaceX has been a game-changer, relying solely on one provider is risky. The recent issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft highlight the importance of diversity in the space program. The author argues that supporting and developing multiple providers is crucial to maintain a strong and secure presence in space.
