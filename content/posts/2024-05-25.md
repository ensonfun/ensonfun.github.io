Overall, the author advocates for simplicity and recommends following Janet Carr's example in this regard.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author describes how they were drawn to Clojure because of its core.async library, which allows for CSP-style concurrency. They appreciate the use of channels/queues as an effective abstraction for enabling communication between threads. Although they consider ZeroMQ as a helpful library for this purpose, they find core.async to be even easier and more pleasant to use. 

Regarding RabbitMQ, the author doesn't think it is bad and finds the default docker configuration suitable for most scenarios, especially for smaller applications. They believe the ability to restart/requeue jobs when a worker crashes is worth the slight increase in complexity. For larger projects, such as those involving over 100 nodes, the author suggests considering RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ as potential options. However, for a smaller project like the one mentioned, they recommend using core.async to mimic the desired behavior, as it is the more appropriate choice.

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 This article discusses the concept of tail recursion and how it differs from regular recursion. Tail recursion is when the recursive call is the last thing the function does before returning its own result. The article provides examples of tail-recursive implementations of factorial and computing the Fibonacci sequence. It also explains the concept of tail-call optimization (TCO) and how it can help optimize tail-recursive functions by converting the tail call to a jump. The article mentions that some languages, like Python, do not support TCO, but other languages like Scheme and Clojure do. Clojure, for example, encourages using manual TCO conversion using the loop...recur pair. The article concludes by discussing the benefits of the iterative approach over the recursive approach for avoiding stack overflow.
