## 2. [A coder considers the waning days of the craft](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38257094)

**Total comment counts : 156**

### Summary

 The author, James Somers, reflects on his belief that teaching his children to code would be an essential skill for their future employability. However, his perception changed when he witnessed his friend, Ben, using GPT-4, an artificial intelligence program, to assist with coding tasks. Ben was able to quickly deliver software solutions without much effort, leading Somers to question the future of coding as a valuable skill. He compares this experience to Lee Sedol, a renowned Go player who lost to a computer program, realizing that coding, like playing Go, may be taken over by AI advancements. Somers concludes by suggesting that vast amounts of knowledge and skills are being rapidly absorbed by AI, potentially diminishing the significance of coding as a specialty domain.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses admiration for GPT4, a software, but states that coding was never the main focus of software development for them. They acknowledge that while GPT4 is impressive, it frequently fails, especially when there is a lack of training resources. However, the author believes that even if GPT4 was 20 times better, it would be beneficial for the world to have cheaper and easier-to-make good software. They also mention that AI is not stopping anyone from pursuing coding as a hobby, and while they do not see coding disappearing soon, they state that it never seemed to be the main purpose of software engineering.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their diminishing impression of LLMs (Language Model Models) over time. They initially felt concerned about their own obsolescence when Copilot was introduced in 2021. However, the author concludes that modern LLMs are fundamentally flawed and not on the path to general intelligence, based on their own experience and research. They believe that the current technology is outdated, and although newer versions may be better, there is no significant improvement. The author suggests that once true powerful artificial intelligence is developed, people will look back and realize that the attention given to LLMs was excessive.

## 5. [Low current around roots boosts plant growth](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38256137)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Bioengineers at the CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology in Hyderabad have discovered that low voltage generated in the soil around plant roots can promote the growth of mung bean and chickpea plants. By placing specific electrodes in the soil, the voltage is converted into a low current that stimulates metabolic processes, including photosynthesis, resulting in increased plant height, leaf area, flowering, weight, and chlorophyll content. The method also shortened the time it took for the plants to transition from the vegetative phase to the reproductive phase. Furthermore, the electrical stimulus increased the plants' capacity to tolerate stress and induced the production of aquaporins, which aid in water and solute transport in plant cells. This technique has the potential to be used for sustainable agriculture and the decontamination of polluted soil.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recommends reading about Jagdish Chandra Bose's research on the history of plants, electricity, and signaling. They mention that Jagdish Chandra Bose was a teacher of Satyendra Nath Bose, who is known for his work on the boson/Bose-Einstein condensate.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Soil microbes interact with plant roots to generate low voltage, which can be converted into a low current using specific electrodes in the soil. This current acts as a stimulus for plant growth by enhancing metabolic processes like photosynthesis. In an experiment, seedlings were grown in pots containing a mixture of red soil, sand, and fungicide to prevent fungal infections. The author suggests that it would be interesting to test this method in different soil types, particularly those with more fertile and balanced conditions. They propose that in such soil types, the conversion of voltage to current might occur naturally due to the presence of anodes and cathodes.

## 6. [Nepal bans TikTok and says it disrupts social harmony](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38256810)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 Nepal's government has decided to ban TikTok, citing concerns that the popular social media app was disrupting "social harmony" in the country. The announcement was made following a Cabinet meeting, with Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud stating that the ban was necessary to regulate the platform and prevent the spread of indecent materials. The government has also requested that social media companies register and open a liaison office in Nepal, pay taxes, and abide by the country's laws and regulations. It remains unclear what triggered the ban or if TikTok had refused to comply with Nepal's requests. TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, has faced scrutiny in multiple countries due to fears that user data may be harvested or used to advance Beijing's interests.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses support for a potential TikTok ban but suggests that the issue lies with the app's design, which resembles a slot machine. They argue that it is the design itself that should be subject to regulation, rather than targeting specific apps like TikTok. The author also argues that platforms like Instagram and Facebook are similarly problematic.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that TikTok was banned in Nepal due to ongoing communal violence between Hindus and Muslims. The situation is reminiscent of the violence seen in Gujarat in 2002. The ban is particularly significant during election season in India because some provinces in Nepal have ethnic ties to major swing states in Indian elections. The article also mentions a past incident where Nepal faced a blockade as a result of a divisive election in Bihar.
