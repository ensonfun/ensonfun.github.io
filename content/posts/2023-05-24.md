## 1. [Regent – Electric coastal travel](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36051831)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 A company manufactures all-electric, wing-in-ground-effect vehicles for coastal transportation, using real-world-proven technology. They have already sold over 467 seagliders with a $7.9B order backlog. The electric propulsion system drastically decreases fuel costs, maintenance, and taxes, while allowing for faster door-to-door transportation and zero-emission travel. The company's experienced engineers aim to pioneer high-speed, safe, and regional zero-emission transportation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that using a light electric ferry service between Ala Wai and Lahaina harbors in Hawaii could be a successful and more efficient alternative to inter-island travel using jet aircraft, which involves time-consuming processes such as airport security. The previous ferry service was terminated due to environmental concerns, but a new electric ferry service could potentially offer a premium product for travelers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Regent, an aviation and ferry company, has reportedly received over $7.9bn in orders and sold 467 seagliders, which are regulated as maritime vessels. The firm aims to transport customers via sea between destinations with limited air routes, such as islands, and marine conditions that may make seagliders more suitable than aircraft. However, manufacturing transport is a difficult process, particularly given the high regulatory compliance costs, and hence, the ultimate success of Regent remains to be seen.

## 2. [PyPI Was Subpoenaed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36061407)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The Python Software Foundation (PSF) received three subpoenas for user data in March and April 2023 issued by the United States Department of Justice. The data request related to five PyPI usernames, and the PSF determined with legal consultation that their only course of action was to provide the requested data. PyPI and the PSF are committed to the freedom, security, and privacy of their users, and as a result, they are developing new data retention and disclosure policies. The post also details the extent and shape of the data contained in the responses to the subpoenas, which includes usernames, email addresses, and records of changes to projects on the index. The PSF assures its users it is dedicated to protecting their data from disclosure and ensuring transparency.

## 3. [Venus is not Earth’s closest neighbor (2019) [pdf]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36055826)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The article encourages readers to participate in a discussion by asking questions and sharing their comments.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the closest planet to Earth currently is Mercury, followed by Venus. However, in terms of how difficult it is to reach, Venus is the closest according to a delt-v map, which measures the change in velocity required to travel to another planet. The idea of "closest" can be subjective and varies depending on the metric used. Ultimately, neither measure is particularly useful for most purposes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that although the Earth spends more time in closer proximity to Mercury than Venus due to orbital mechanics, Venus should still be considered our closest neighbor because of its constant proximity to Earth. The article deems the argument about the Earth spending more time with Mercury as an annoying "gotcha" twist of language and reminds readers that Venus is still the nearest planet.

## 4. [50 years in filesystems: towards 2004 – LFS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36051710)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Log-Structured File System (LFS), which was presented in a paper by Mendel Rosenblum and John K. Ousterhout in 1992. LFS proposes never overwriting any data and always appending changed blocks to the end of a log. The article explains the background behind LFS and how it evolved. LFS partitions storage into contiguous segments and has a multi-tier compaction process that mirrors Java objects' generations. The article covers features and subsystems of LFS compared to traditional file systems and presents improvements in the BSD FFS implementation of LFS. The benchmark results revealed that LFS had better write performance but weaker read performance due to fragmented data.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The main issue with enterprise storage is the lack of integration in the IO (input/output) stack. Various layers, such as the application, filesystem, volume manager, disk drive, and disk controller, do not work well together and do not have the ability to predict what the others will need next. This results in wasteful and less performant processes. There is a need for a standard API that allows the application to communicate its behavior to the disk drive, which the disk controller can then translate into backend disk actions. TRIM is given as an example of this, and there is a need for more similar APIs to be put into the filesystem and passed through to the backend.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the advantages of using flash storage over disks and how NAND FTLs are log-structured due to the sequential programming nature of pages in each block, the ability to erase entire blocks at once, and the need to evenly use all blocks even when updating a single logical sector repeatedly.

 The article discusses Frank Snepp's book, "Decent Interval: An Insider’s Account of Saigon’s Indecent End Told by the CIA’s Chief Strategy Analyst in Vietnam," which was published in 1977 and recounts the final days of the American presence in Vietnam. The CIA attempted to block Snepp from earning royalties from the book and set an example for other agents by making him pay $300,000 to his former handlers. The article suggests that the incident still holds relevance today.

 The trade lane rates are currently similar to 2019 levels, however, fuel and labor costs have increased since the pandemic. Although there was a brief period of high prices, there is no real crisis since the reporting is only highlighting the end of that period.

## 7. [The Hammerhead Worm](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36051635)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The hammerhead worm, an invasive species native to Southeast Asia, has recently been found in many parts of Texas. These worms are poisonous, slimy, and can grow up to a foot long. They are a threat to local ecosystems as they eat earthworms, which play an important role in maintaining soil health. Hammerhead worms are also the only terrestrial invertebrates known to secrete a neurotoxin, causing pets to feel ill for a day after ingesting them. Flatworms reproduce by ripping themselves in half, making it important to correctly dispose of them by placing them in a Ziploc bag with vinegar or salt. The Texas Invasive Species Institute is asking Texans to report any sightings of hammerhead worms.

 The article describes a resistance technique used for eating where the author positioned their head below their stomach in a kneeling posture, requiring food to be swallowed while pushing up an incline. The author practiced this technique and was able to complete the swallowing process with their head resting on their hands on the floor. No determination was made on the optimal platform height necessary for this practice.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article noticed that their GERD (acid reflux) went away after working on handstands and attributed it to doing daily lower esophageal sphincter (LES) exercises. They also noticed that when they started training headstands, they experienced reflux but it eventually went away. They wonder if training the LES muscle had a similar effect.
