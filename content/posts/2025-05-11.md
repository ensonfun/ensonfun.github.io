## 9. [Dotless Domains](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43950525)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 A "dotless domain" refers to top-level domains (TLDs) that can be accessed directly without a second label, like "http://com/" rather than "http://example.com/". ICANN and IAB oppose dotless domains, particularly for generic TLDs, while country code TLDs (ccTLDs) may have active dotless domains. Email protocols generally require two labels, making dotless emails impractical. Dotless domains can theoretically include DNS records, but most existing TLDs do not. The root domain could also potentially have records, although this is highly unlikely. Concerns over dotless domains relate to security and potential confusion in the DNS hierarchy.
