## 6. [Turning the database inside-out (2015)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828720)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses a talk given by the author at Øredev in Malmö, Sweden, on November 5, 2015, which was a reiteration of a presentation from Strange Loop 2014. The talk critiques traditional databases for maintaining mutable, global state, a practice long abandoned in modern programming due to its drawbacks. Instead, the author advocates for a new model where databases are treated as collections of immutable facts, which can be processed in real-time using functional programming techniques.

The focus is on **Apache Samza**, a distributed stream processing framework developed by LinkedIn, which utilizes Apache Kafka for its core functionality as a distributed, durable commit log. Samza is presented not just as a tool for real-time analytics but as a means to revolutionize database architecture by:

1. **Turning databases inside out** - Making the internal operations more accessible and modifiable, leading to simpler code, better scalability, robustness, lower latency, and increased flexibility.

2. **Processing Data in Streams** - Data is processed as it arrives, rather than being queried from a static state, which aligns with modern data handling practices.

The talk aims to inspire developers to rethink how they design and interact with databases, suggesting that this new approach could significantly enhance application architecture. The author also mentions his background, his book "Designing Data-Intensive Applications," and provides ways for the audience to stay updated with his work, including supporting him on Patreon.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an approach to event handling and data processing using Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL). Here's a summary:

- **Event Storage**: Events are stored in SQL tables, which serve as the primary storage mechanism.
  
- **Data Processing**: Workers listen for new data entries in these tables to update projections. This is mostly done asynchronously, though database triggers are sometimes used.

- **Listening Mechanism**: The author developed a custom solution for MSSQL to listen to new data entries, which can be found on GitHub. This was necessary because MSSQL does not have a built-in feature like PostgreSQL's change data capture.

- **Advantages**:
  - The approach allows for stateless, functional backend code, reducing the need for mutable database objects.
  - It's useful for testing or dry-running business logic without affecting the live data.

- **Implementation Choice**: Instead of adopting Kafka, which would mean moving away from SQL, the team chose to extend SQL capabilities because:
  - Keeping all data in SQL makes debugging easier.
  - It leverages existing SQL infrastructure with minimal changes.

- **Future Improvements**: The author expresses a desire for:
  - More database features tailored for this event-driven architecture, like explicit partition event tables similar to Kafka but within SQL.
  - The ability to define projections as SQL queries that automatically create asynchronous triggers.

- **Notable Mention**: The author mentions Materialize as a database that operates in a similar space, suggesting it might offer some of the desired features.

## 9. [New speculative attacks on Apple CPUs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42856023)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article discusses two new speculative execution attacks named **SLAP** (Speculative Load Address Predictor) and **FLOP** (Load Value Predictor), which exploit hardware vulnerabilities in recent Apple CPUs:

1. **SLAP** targets the Load Address Predictor in Apple CPUs starting from M2/A15. It leverages the CPU's optimization for guessing future memory addresses based on past access patterns. If the predictor guesses incorrectly, it leads to speculative execution on out-of-bounds data, potentially leaking sensitive information like email content or browsing behavior. A demonstration was performed on the Safari browser, recovering sensitive information.

2. **FLOP** focuses on the Load Value Predictor in Apple's M3/A17 and newer CPUs, which predicts data values before they are actually fetched from memory. Incorrect predictions can lead to bypassing critical memory safety checks, allowing for arbitrary memory reads. The attack was demonstrated on both Safari and Chrome, recovering personal data like location history and credit card details.

Both attacks utilize speculative execution to perform unauthorized operations:
- **SLAP** was shown to recover parts of "The Great Gatsby" without architectural access.
- **FLOP** recovered parts of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in a similar manner.

**Mitigations** and **Impact**:
- These vulnerabilities break the isolation between webpages, allowing attackers to access sensitive data from other webpages.
- Apple has been informed and plans to address these issues in future security updates. Users are advised to keep their devices updated.
- The attacks are microarchitecture-based, leaving no traces in logs, making them difficult to detect.

The article concludes by noting that while SLAP and FLOP are new, they represent a broader class of side-channel attacks exploiting CPU microarchitecture, with no evidence of their use in the wild yet.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a security demonstration called SLAP, which highlights the importance of **defense-in-depth** in cybersecurity. Specifically, it points out a vulnerability in Safari where calling `window.open` in JavaScript does not isolate new windows into separate processes. This lack of process isolation allows for potential exploits. The article emphasizes that if data is kept in a separate process with adequate isolation from any "hostile" process, other side-channel attacks or vulnerabilities become irrelevant because the exploit cannot access the data across process boundaries. Essentially, proper process isolation can significantly enhance the security of a system by preventing such exploits.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights a security concern regarding Apple's Safari browser, which lacks **Site Isolation**, a feature that helps enhance security and privacy by isolating different websites from each other. The author expresses surprise and criticism towards Apple for not implementing this feature, suggesting it reflects poorly on Apple's commitment to security and privacy.
