## 1. [In loving memory of square checkbox](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39161339)

**Total comment counts : 57**

### Summary

 The article discusses the convention of using square checkboxes and round radio buttons in operating systems and how this convention has been changed by the web and CSS. It mentions that while checkboxes have traditionally been square and radio buttons round, the web introduced different designs for these elements, such as radio buttons with checkmarks and square radio buttons. However, operating system vendors have largely stuck to the convention. The article states that Apple is the first major operating system vendor to abandon the convention, as their new visionOS will have round checkboxes. The author concludes that with Apple's decision, there is no hope for the tradition to continue and predicts that the square checkbox will finally die in 2024.

## 3. [I hacked a train toilet](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39163797)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The author recounts their experience riding on a Class 800 train in the UK, specifically focusing on the design of the disabled toilets on board. The author explains that older models of these toilets had separate buttons for closing and locking the door, while the newer models have a lever that must be moved to lock the door. However, the lever is not directly connected to a locking mechanism but instead sends a signal to a microcontroller. The author highlights a potential security flaw in the design, where it is possible to manipulate the lever in a way that the locking pin does not engage properly but still allows the door to be closed. This vulnerability could potentially be used for a Denial of Service attack on the train toilet. The author mentions that they have encountered similar vulnerabilities on trains in the past and also provides a link to a video demonstrating the issue.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains the reason for separating the closing and locking functions of toilet doors, but not the opening and unlocking functions. The purpose of this separation is to prevent a Denial of Service attack where someone can press "close" and leave before the door closes, resulting in the toilet becoming permanently inaccessible. The author shares a personal experience from their elementary school days, where students would use a screwdriver or swiss army knife to lock all the toilet doors from the outside, making it appear that all stalls were occupied.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author shares a personal experience of being on a train in Sweden where the motorized door unexpectedly started opening while they were using the toilet. They attempted to push the door back, but had to prioritize putting their trousers on. The toilet on this train was wider than a normal seat, with seats facing towards it. Although the situation was embarrassing, the author considers it a humorous anecdote and did not investigate further.

However, it concludes by stating that more breakthrough headlines may be expected in the near future.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the energy density of gasoline compared to liquid hydrogen.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author notes that artificial intelligence (AI) is not helpful in addressing global warming because the exact solution is already known, but there is unwillingness to implement it. This solution is believed to be a carbon tax, which economists agree is the most efficient way to combat global warming. However, there is political resistance to implementing it due to its framing as a tax. The author suggests looking into the concept of a carbon tax, explaining that it creates a system where the best action for the planet is also the cheapest for individuals and businesses. This eliminates the need to convince every individual to change their beliefs or morality.

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 The author of the article shares their experiences with self-hosting and the security risks they have encountered. They mention that exposing IP addresses on the public internet invites malicious traffic and discuss common types of attacks they have observed. The first type of attack is directory traversal, where attackers search for files such as .env and credentials in commonly known locations. The author also notes that attackers look for common directories and accidentally exposed files. The article highlights the importance of minimizing exposure to the public internet and using authentication and IP restrictions when necessary. The article also mentions a specific vulnerability called Shellshock, which exploits webservers that execute CGI scripts with a vulnerable bash version, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands. Lastly, the article describes an attack targeting the LuCI web interface for OpenWRT routers, where a command is injected into a form field to download and execute a shell script from a remote server.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author highlights an interesting observation that attackers monitor Certificate Transparency logs to identify newly issued certificates and target those websites. They share their personal experience of a server receiving minimal traffic until they obtained a certificate from Let's Encrypt, after which it was flooded with malicious hits. The main lesson from this is to secure new servers and services as soon as possible, even before they are accessible to the public.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article explains their experience with managing self-hosted sites and analyzing access logs for security purposes. They initially used an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to detect attack attempts, but later found it to be a waste of time and stopped using it. They recommend relying on useful content that summarizes common vulnerabilities and attacks to guide server management, as well as following best practices for web server technology. The author emphasizes the importance of promptly patching disclosed vulnerabilities, as most attacks target these. While log analysis can be helpful in diagnosing problems after security incidents, the author found it mainly useful for identifying known vulnerabilities that were not patched in a timely manner.
