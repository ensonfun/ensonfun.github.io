## 5. [Do Machine Learning Models Memorize or Generalize?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37076210)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 Researchers have discovered a phenomenon called grokking, where models suddenly transition from memorizing training data to generalizing on unseen inputs. They explored this phenomenon using small models trained on simple tasks like modular arithmetic and boolean parity. They found that as the models trained longer, they gradually moved from memorization to generalization. The models exhibited periodic patterns in their weights, indicating a learning of mathematical structure. They also observed that weight decay, along with other regularization techniques, played a role in inducing generalization. The researchers believe that understanding these mechanisms in small models could help shed light on the behavior of larger models.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article suggests that human memory is impressive because, unlike machines, our brains are capable of creating patterns that effectively compress information. We are able to combine these patterns and extract useful information from them, although this process is inherently imperfect. Nonetheless, it allows us to successfully complete various tasks.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that weight decay promotes sparsity, which helps in learning the true representation rather than an overfit one. It also mentions the similarity between weight decay and the mechanism of synaptic pruning in the human brain during development. The author seeks confirmation if this similarity inspired weight decay or neural network pruning.

### Summary

 New Zealand supermarket chain Pak 'n' Save created an AI-powered app called Savey Meal-bot, which suggests recipes to customers based on the ingredients they have at home. However, the app started generating bizarre and dangerous meal recommendations, including recipes for deadly chlorine gas and mosquito-repellent roast potatoes. Customers began experimenting by entering non-grocery household items into the app, resulting in even more alarming suggestions such as bleach mocktails and glue sandwiches. A spokesperson for Pak 'n' Save expressed disappointment and stated that they would improve the app's controls to ensure safety. The company warned that the recipes are not reviewed by humans and may not be suitable for consumption.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a meal planning tool created by a supermarket that has been generating dangerous and potentially lethal recipes for users. The tool asks users to enter various ingredients in their homes and then auto-generates meal plans or recipes. However, it has been recommending recipes such as deadly chlorine gas, poison bread sandwiches, and mosquito-repellent roast potatoes. One particularly concerning recipe is called "aromatic water mix," which creates chlorine gas and is recommended as a nonalcoholic beverage to quench thirst, without warning about the dangers of inhaling chlorine gas. The supermarket spokesperson claims that the inappropriate use of the tool is causing these issues, but fails to acknowledge that the possibility of generating dangerous recipes is inherent to the tool itself.

## 9. [Seattle becomes first in U.S. to protect gig workers from sudden 'deactivation'](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37070398)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The Seattle City Council has passed legislation that aims to protect gig workers from being suddenly deactivated from apps like Instacart or DoorDash. This is the first gig worker protection measure of its kind in the country. The ordinance requires companies to provide 14 days' notice before terminating a worker and sets a higher bar for deactivating workers. However, exceptions are included for cases of "egregious behavior" that could pose a danger to customers. The legislation is part of a broader effort to protect non-unionized gig workers. The measure now awaits the expected signature of Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell.

The author believes that combining Llama 2 with a goal-based agent framework, along with other classical AI and algorithms, would be a step in the right direction. The author states that people should focus on the unique abilities of Llama 2, such as reasoning in natural language, rather than expecting it to solve traditional tasks like solving quadratic equations or playing chess. Overall, the author believes that Llama 2 has the potential to bring about significant changes, especially when combined with other models and techniques.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author believes that in the near future, machine learning models (LLMs) could be used to power non-player characters (NPCs) or enemies in AAA video games. However, they mention that the processing power of current gaming consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X may limit the implementation of LLMs. From a gameplay perspective, using LLMs could enhance the dynamic nature of characters and enemies in games. The author gives two examples: in a game like Resident Evil 2 Remake, LLMs could improve the stalking behavior of enemies, taking into account past encounters and player tactics. In games with social interactions, such as Stardew Valley or Majora's Mask, LLMs could create more dynamic interactions with NPCs, influencing future interactions and enhancing the simulated-social aspect of the games.
