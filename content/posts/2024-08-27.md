**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses the progress made in running The Witcher 3 game on a RISC-V PC, which is believed to be the first AAA game to run on this type of machine. The initial challenges were related to implementing x86_64 instructions correctly and the lack of RISC-V devices that could be connected to AMD graphics cards. However, with the help of the Milk-V Pioneer and finding a way to connect an AMD graphics card to a VisionFive 2 device, the developers were able to fix bugs and add new instructions, leading to successful gameplay of The Witcher 3. The article also mentions the differences in the number and performance of instructions between RISC-V and other architectures, as well as the potential of the RVV vector extension to improve performance. However, the author highlights two critical missing instructions in RISC-V that affect translation efficiency in x86 emulation.

## 2. [Microsoft donates the Mono Project to the Wine team](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41371106)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The WineHQ organization will be taking over as the stewards of the Mono Project, which has been an important part of the .NET ecosystem since 2001. Microsoft acquired Xamarin, the previous steward of the Mono Project, in 2016. The last major release of the Mono Project was in July 2019, with minor patch releases since then. The WineHQ organization will maintain the source code in existing repositories, although some repos may be archived. Binaries will remain available for up to four years. Microsoft maintains a modern fork of the Mono runtime in the dotnet/runtime repository and recommends active Mono users and maintainers migrate to .NET. The Mono Project was the first .NET implementation on Android, iOS, Linux, and other operating systems, and it enabled cross-platform .NET development. Sponsored by Microsoft, Mono is an open-source implementation of the .NET Framework based on ECMA standards. The latest Mono release is available for download and the community is encouraged to contribute to the project.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the reasons behind the decision to move Mono, a portable Common Language Runtime (CLR) for platforms that Microsoft did not prioritize, to Wine, an open-source compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run on Unix-like operating systems. The author explains that Mono was initially developed for environments where full .NET could not be utilized, such as on the iPhone or for obsolete architectures like Alpha, Itanium, PPC, and MIPs. However, with the introduction of DotNET Core, which aimed to make .NET more portable, and the acquisition of Xamarin by Microsoft, a single, more focused project became more practical. Mono was still used for specific cases like Wine, GNOME Desktop, second life, and Unity but could no longer sustain itself as a separate project due to overlaps with DotNET Core. Moving Mono to Wine was seen as a logical and suitable choice, as it can serve as a compatible runtime.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In an article, the author expresses surprise at Microsoft's stance on Wine and other re-implementations of their APIs. They assumed that Microsoft did not endorse these projects but did not take legal action against them due to DMCA reverse engineering provisions and their perceived insignificance. However, it was discovered that in 2005, Microsoft started checking the Windows Registry for the Wine configuration key and would block Windows Update for any component, implying that Microsoft acknowledged Wine's existence. Additionally, in 2020, Microsoft cited Wine as a positive consequence of being able to reimplement APIs in its amicus curiae brief for Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.

 The author used to take many courses on platforms like Coursera and EdX, but has since reduced the number of courses they take. They found some of the courses to be excellent and rewarding, such as Daphne Koller's Probabilistic Graphical Models and Robert Sedgewick's Analytical Combinatorics. However, they also found that these courses had diminishing returns for a few reasons. Firstly, the assignments in MOOCs are often multiple-choice questions or programming tasks that lack the depth and challenge found in university courses. Secondly, there is a lack of feedback and support compared to traditional university courses. Finally, some courses are less rigorous and watered down compared to their counterparts at respected universities. While the author is grateful for the learning opportunities, they question the effectiveness of these courses in building solid foundations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) for not being run like universities, but rather like job training centers. The author mentions that most MOOCs offer the same courses and degrees, except for a few exceptions like Georgia Tech's OMSCS, which aims to provide online degrees at a lower cost. The author argues that a successful MOOC should allow students to take courses on a variety of subjects like Ulysses, Semantics, Mathematics, or Plato, similar to what is offered in traditional undergraduate programs, but without the financial and time constraints. The author suggests that MOOCs should provide the flexibility of exploring different areas of interest or focusing on a specific degree.

## 7. [Anthropic publishes the 'system prompts' that make Claude tick](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41364637)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of system prompts in generative AI models. These prompts are instructions given to the models that shape their behavior and responses. While most vendors keep their system prompts undisclosed, Anthropic has chosen to publish them for its latest models. The prompts outline what the models can and cannot do, as well as certain personality traits they should exemplify. Anthropic aims to be a more ethical and transparent AI vendor by disclosing these prompts. The article suggests that this move puts pressure on competitors to do the same. However, it also emphasizes that without human guidance, these models are essentially blank slates.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that a prompt is now acknowledging the phenomenon of "hallucinations." The virtual assistant named Claude warns users that when asked about obscure topics or information not commonly found on the internet, it may provide inaccurate information or make up citations. This is why Claude uses the term "hallucinate" to explain this phenomenon. The article suggests that it is important for users to be aware of this possibility and double-check the information provided by the virtual assistant.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author created an "auto-script-writer" that sends a python script, prompt, and test results to either GPT4 or Claude. After testing with both, they found that Claude is far better at generating scripts and producing good output consistently. GPT4 would often go off track and produce bad outputs. The author concludes that Claude's superiority is worth the higher cost.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses frustration with the slow speed of updating FreeBSD from version 13.0 to 14.0. They mention that the process is especially slow because they run their FreeBSD systems off spinning drives and have the src files. The author suggests that the freebsd-update script is complex and could be improved by using data structures instead of forking. They also note that the update process involves multiple writes of each file, which could be streamlined if the install option had the ability to decompress. The author is also dissatisfied with the large number of files in the update directory and suggests dividing them into smaller directories. They mention the potential for parallelism in the update process but acknowledge its difficulty in a shell script. The author expresses interest in exploring the use of ZFS boot environments for updates and the ability to run `pkg upgrade` in the boot environment before rebooting. They propose that if the process allows for the live environment to continue working, they would be more patient with the update. Finally, they mention the possibility of using the Rustdate environment for these improvements.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses freebsd-rustdate, which is a reimplementation of freebsd-update. While it is expected to be similar in usage, it is not identical. This raises the question of whether reimplementation is defeating the purpose if it cannot be used as a drop-in replacement.
