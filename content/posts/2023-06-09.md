## 1. [Mechanical Apple Watch from real e-waste Apple Watch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36249671)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 The author of the article spent the last three months constructing a mechanical Apple Watch using a Seiko NH38 watch movement and 42mm Series 1 Apple Watch in stainless steel, among other parts. The author was inspired to create this watch after realizing they would be spending a lot of money on features they neither needed nor would use in a regular Apple Watch. By using secondhand parts, the author was able to source cheap and easily replaceable parts for their project. The finished product lasted the Seiko rated 40 hours and loses anywhere from 3-20 seconds a day. The author gutted the Apple Watch completely and used heat to separate the glass from the LOCA holding the digitizer. The author also removed the sensor holder that senses the digital crown turning. The project took longer than expected due to delicate and confusing processes, but the author was ultimately successful in creating a mechanical Apple Watch.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article praises the engineering marvel of the mechanical watch movement, highlighting the presence of 24 lab-grown rubies and sapphires inside the NH38 movement. It argues that while the Apple Watch is more advanced in some ways, the mechanical watch movement is more impressive due to several thousands of years of mechanical engineering behind it. The author appreciates both electronic and mechanical timekeeping.

## 3. [June 2023 Data Dump is missing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36257523)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The Stack Exchange data dump, which provides a subset of community-contributed data on Stack Exchange websites, has not been updated since March. A company representative explained that the data dump is being gated to prevent misuse by organizations that might profit from the community's work. Some users have expressed concerns that Stack Exchange is backing away from a promise to provide free access to community-contributed data indefinitely. However, the data is open access under a CC BY-SA license, so users are free to host it elsewhere if Stack Exchange blocks access.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights a major risk in the current structure of online communication using Reddit and Stack Exchange as examples. These platforms build a community with user contributions, but the companies can then restrict access to all the community-built content even though they only provided the platform and stored data. The article argues for a rethink of this model and for the knowledge and thoughts of users to belong to the communities and users themselves. It suggests decentralizing communication back to smaller, focused forums with less anonymity and more persistent communication run by trusted individuals in order to prevent mega-companies from harvesting data.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses frustration at Stack Overflow's response to systems like CodeGPT and GitHub copilot using their data. They argue that Stack Overflow's data is provided for free by the community and that the platform should recognize the role of its contributors. The author notes that none of the contributors, aside from employees, have received payment for their work on the site. The article highlights Stack Overflow's apparent focus on revenue and reveals an attitude that has left the author feeling disappointed.

### Summary

 The article is a message to a user (possibly a bot) explaining that the platform has detected multiple requests in a short amount of time, and as a result, they are enforcing a limit to prevent misuse. The message advises the user to wait for five seconds and try again, and if they are not a bot, to change the browser user agent string. It also reminds developers to make no more than one request every two seconds to avoid triggering the limit.

## 8. [Mark Zuckerberg on Apple’s Vision Pro headset](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36247404)

**Total comment counts : 71**

### Summary

 Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (previously Facebook), stated in a company meeting that Apple's newly introduced augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro, does not present any significant technological advancements that Meta has not already explored and does not align with their vision for how people will use the device. He also pointed out that Meta's upcoming Quest 3 headset, priced at $499, which is much cheaper than the Vision Pro's $3,499 price tag, gives Meta an opportunity to reach a wider user base. Zuckerberg emphasized that Meta's VR technology aims to bring people together while being active, which is different from Apple's approach of experiencing technology while being alone on a couch. Although Apple's device poses competition, Meta plans to succeed with its differentiated vision.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Tech companies are convinced that VR, AR, and SC will be profitable if the right combination of hardware and software is developed. However, the widespread adoption of these technologies has been hindered by a lack of indications that they are empowering and a major new mode of interfacing with computing. The author suggests that stories about teams wearing VR devices all the time because they are more productive or social or fun would be an indicator of the technology's potential.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential threat that Apple's entry into the virtual reality market poses to Facebook's Oculus. The author notes that the demonstrations of Apple's VR technology have been shown with a person alone on a couch, suggesting a more private and user-friendly experience than that of Oculus. Additionally, Apple's integration of hardware and software is seen as a strength, potentially leading to a more coherent and natural experience for users. The author speculates that Apple may also offer versions of their technology that outsource computing power and stream video. The article concludes by suggesting that Facebook may be at risk of losing their investment in Oculus.

## 9. [Archive your Reddit data before it's too late](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36259930)

**Total comment counts : 48**

### Summary

 The author of the article has created a Python tool called "reddit-user-to-sqlite" that builds an archive of all of your posts and comments on Reddit. The impending changes to Reddit's public API have prompted the author to create this tool, as it allows you to store structured and searchable data in a single file that you can keep even if the Reddit platform changes. The tool requires some knowledge of the command line but once you have a database file, you can use it with Datasette to sort by columns and perform full-text searches on your comments and posts. The author suggests running it periodically to keep your archive up-to-date and recommends doing so before June 30th, 2023, which is when the API terms will change.

## 10. [Startups drive commercialization of high-impact innovations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36244647)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 According to a recent working paper, startups have an advantage over incumbent firms when it comes to potentially disruptive R&D, as established companies have more to lose from discovering technologies that replace traditional ways of doing things. The paper focused on patents that emerged from university-based research ecosystems and found that startups were more likely to undertake disruptive innovation, whereas incumbent firms and universities tended to commercialize patents considered to be less disruptive. The research also revealed that between 2001 and 2019, patent licenses granted by the top-25 research universities that went to startups grew from 19% to 27%, while grants to large firms fell by about 10 percentage points.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that equity finance driven startups use reinforcement learning strategy to explore and find a new high margin process, which is then exploited to the fullest to maximum financial returns. Startups are viewed as explorers seeking perfect ROI while taking risks in search of a new paradigm that would lead them to become monopolists or oligopolists. Evaluation of regulatory capture processes such as patents are accrued primarily to new entrants, and technology is often a key differentiator for structural change through new processes. However, larger monopolies may also accrete these companies and technologies until a social tipping point is reached and the entire system collapses.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is discussing how their workplace, a wealth management bank, was reluctant to invest in a mobile app for trading due to fear that it would cannibalize their current portfolio. They eventually built the app, but it was priced similarly to their bespoke services, resulting in limited success. The article suggests that questioning whether a new idea will harm current profits is a common practice, but sometimes innovation is necessary for growth. The author laments that although the company is profitable, the money goes to shareholders rather than employees.
