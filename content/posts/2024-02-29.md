## 1. [How video games use lookup tables](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39534574)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 This article discusses the use of look-up-tables (LUTs) in graphics programming, using WebGL as an example. LUTs allow for creative techniques in manipulating video footage, such as turning grayscale footage into color or creating variations of images. The article explains the use of LUTs in the fragment shader, where each pixel's final color is determined. The article also mentions the performance implications of using LUTs and provides examples of how they have been used in games like Left 4 Dead.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains the use of lookup tables to achieve a specific effect in a video game. The author describes how two lookup tables are used: one for storing lighting details around the player and another for pseudo-randomly ordering background rows. By randomizing the order, the author is able to give the effect a "soft edge" and hide the raster scan. The author uses a lookup table because calculating the random order in real-time would be too slow.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of look-up tables to create a textured tunnel effect. By knowing the angle and distance of each pixel from the center of the screen, designers can determine which texture to place at each location, creating the illusion of moving through a 3D tunnel. It is noted that this effect is relatively inexpensive and can even be implemented on lower-end devices. The author initially thought that the game Stardust used this effect, but it is revealed that the game actually utilizes a repeating 6-frame animation for the background.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential challenges faced by 600 groups that rely on fiscal sponsorship. Fiscal sponsorship is a mechanism in the US charitable world where an existing 501(c)(3) organization handles the administrative tasks and legal requirements for another organization that wants to accept charitable donations. The fiscal sponsor takes care of paperwork, provides a bank account, and ensures compliance with regulations. In return, they receive a small portion of the donations to cover their costs. However, if a fiscal sponsor dissolves, the relationship needs to be unwound, and a new sponsor must be found. The Python Software Foundation is mentioned as an example of an organization that occasionally acts as a fiscal sponsor.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the shutdown of the Open Collective Foundation (OCF) and the impact on various organizations affiliated with it, such as Open Collective and Open Source Collective. Many entities receiving donations through OCF can migrate to other organizations while maintaining existing sponsors, but some may need to find non-OC organizations due to additional requirements. The situation is described as both strange and technical.

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The author describes how they became obsessed with creating checkbox animations. They initially built a JavaScript library called Checkboxland, which allowed text and animations to be displayed on a checkbox grid. After taking a break from the project, they decided to revisit it and create more complex animations, including ones that responded to clicks. This led to the idea of converting images into ASCII text and eventually converting videos into checkbox animations. The author also created a webcam filter using html checkboxes. They mention feeling guilty about spending so much time on these projects when they could be working on more useful things, but they also enjoy the creativity and experimentation. The author contemplates whether to continue making checkbox animations or move on to other projects.
