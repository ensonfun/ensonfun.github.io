Ceramic Shield 2 on the front and Ceramic Shield on the back deliver 3x scratch resistance and 4x crack protection. It features a 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion up to 120Hz and 3000 nits brightness. The 48MP Fusion main camera and an 18MP Center Stage front camera include AI enhancements and Dual Capture. Includes Action Button and Camera Control. Pre-orders Sept 12; stores Sept 19; finishes: Space Black, Cloud White, Light Gold, Sky Blue. Chips: A19 Pro, N1, C1X.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author argues that shrinking a phone’s height and width is more important than reducing its thickness. They also pose the question of whether people find phones too thick to fit in a pocket.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The A19 Pro adds matmul acceleration in its GPU, akin to Nvidia’s Tensor Cores, potentially enabling viable local LLM inference on Macs. Currently, Macs have high memory bandwidth and VRAM but slow prompt processing. If the M5 family adopts this GPU, the era of practical on-device LLMs could be here. That’s the most exciting takeaway from Apple’s event. The piece also notes other updates: an ultra-thin iPhone Air, AirPods 3 with 2x better noise cancellation and live translation, a Watch with high blood pressure detection, and a bold orange iPhone 17 Pro—signs of incremental ecosystem improvements.

## 2. [I still love PHP and JavaScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45188114)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Over two decades I’ve used many languages, yet I love “janky” ones—especially PHP and JavaScript. Their ecosystems evolve rapidly (CPAN, PECL, npm), driving constant innovation. I value their permissiveness: basic issues invite experimentation and let beginners ship real websites in days. Starting with PHP2/3, I enjoy helping newcomers rather than judging them. Janky languages often have active, welcoming communities and surprisingly strong tooling. Legacy codebases can perform well, and I relish making immediate, high‑impact improvements to products used by many people.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Started with PHP in 2002, with the first codebase being phpBB. Since then I’ve built about ten production applications and learned to configure Linux servers, understand the front-end (at times), architecture, security, and management—capabilities that now often require a full team.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Arguing against outdated criticisms, the piece warns people who last used PHP in 2012 not to judge PHP in 2025. It emphasizes PHP is a modern language with types, tooling, and package management.

## 3. [Memory Integrity Enforcement](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45186265)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) is a five-year effort uniting Apple silicon and OS security to deliver always-on memory safety across devices without sacrificing performance. Apple calls it the most significant memory-safety upgrade for consumer OSs. While iPhone has had no widespread system malware, mercenary spyware targets select individuals and exploits memory safety vulnerabilities; such threats exist across Windows and Android too. Apple’s strategy adds safe languages (Swift), secure allocators (kalloc_type and xzone malloc), PAC, and Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension, culminating in a comprehensive, synchronous, high-performance memory-safety defense.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Both analyses show Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) greatly limits attacker exploitation paths. MIE blocks fundamental steps so exploits can’t be rebuilt by swapping bugs, and any remaining memory-corruption effects are unreliable and lack momentum for successful exploitation. A notable implication is for mercenary spyware, whose economics rely on interchangeable exploit chains; countermeasures targeting this modularity are particularly interesting.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Although impressed, the author notes the defense likely won’t protect against repeated attack attempts. The suggested approach involves exploiting out-of-bounds access or a heavily groomed use-after-free to gain a matching tag, with about a 1/16 chance. Details are sparse, so confidence is limited. If it works, remaining exploit chains would have to rely on logic bugs, which would be painful for attackers.

## 4. [Claude can now create and edit files](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45182381)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 Claude can now create and edit Excel spreadsheets, documents, PowerPoint decks, and PDFs directly in Claude.ai and the desktop app. File creation is in preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise; Pro users will get access later. Claude generates actual files from instructions, uploaded data, or research, turning tasks like customer segmentation, sales forecasting, or budget tracking into ready-to-use outputs. This moves Claude from a passive adviser to an active collaborator, using a private computing environment to write code and run programs. Start with simple tasks and progress to complex projects; monitor data risks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece argues reliability must come first, criticizing frequent outages and the use of model quantisation to meet demand, which allegedly reduces intelligence. It suggests that new features are pointless if the core system remains unusable.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Simon Willison published an extensive review of Claude Code Interpreter (officially named Upgraded file creation and analysis). He reverse-engineered the tool, identified its container specs, used it to generate a PDF join diagram for a SQLite database, and re-ran a complex “recreate this chart from a screenshot and XLSX” task he had previously tested with ChatGPT Code Interpreter. Read the full review on his site.

## 5. [Dropbox Paper mobile App Discontinuation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45186011)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 Dropbox will discontinue the Paper mobile and desktop apps on Oct 9, 2025. If installed, the apps won’t update and some features may stop; delete them. Paper files remain securely in Dropbox and can be accessed at paper.dropbox.com on any device. You can create/edit Paper on the web; mobile editing uses the web keyboard. Sharing works on the web or via the Dropbox mobile app. Notifications continue by email and in-app. The Paper desktop beta is also discontinued. You’ll receive a reminder email on Oct 1, 2025.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Dropbox mismanaged Paper for a decade, squandering productivity-tools opportunities. They bought Hackpad and launched Paper, which was strong at launch but leaders failed to see its potential, treating it as an Evernote competitor instead of a Notion-like platform. They pursued side projects rather than building on Dropbox’s core value, letting Notion thrive while Paper waned as Google adds features. An alternate future would have seen Dropbox invest in Paper alongside an Airtable-like product to offer a robust Google Docs/Sheets-like alternative minus the Office clone baggage.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This year saw the discontinuation of Paper (app), Passwords, Send and Track, Vault, and Capture. Vault allegedly ended by automatically converting PIN-protected folders into unprotected ones. The author cautions against relying on these services for anything beyond basic file storage.

## 6. [We all dodged a bullet](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45183029)

**Total comment counts : 51**

### Summary

 An npm attack used a phishing email and tainted popular packages to redirect cryptocurrency payments via MetaMask. The writer calls it a near-miss: the malware only changed payment addresses, but could have stolen API keys or credentials for far worse damage. The attack targeted Web3 users, exploiting generic packages to stay under the radar. It underscores that any dependency could be malicious and calls for deeper scrutiny of dependency trees, even as developers must ship code, noting details may evolve over time.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 NX’s npm supply chain attack exploited the VS Code NX plugin that auto-updates to the latest NX version. An attacker could exfiltrate credentials from a developer’s environment—such as an active GitHub session via the CLI or secrets in a .env file—even when dependencies were pinned and updates were applied. The piece calls for deeper ecosystem changes and points to the GitHub advisory GHSA-cxm3-wv7p-598c.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece criticizes a rogue software release—a crypto-stealer released after gaining package access. It questions why the criminal didn’t invest more time building a fuller exploit. It notes that such malware could exfiltrate API keys, SSH keys, a server’s IP, browser profiles, and session tokens, potentially exposing personal and work data. It warns that stolen data can be sold on forums. It ends with speculation whether skilled cybercriminals are now in higher-paying tech roles.

## 7. [Classic Mac OS System 1 Patterns](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45187778)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 An article compiling 38 eight-by-eight pixel black-and-white patterns from Macintosh System 1’s Control Panel and MacPaint. It links to a blog post, offers a 512×342 sample wallpaper, and says all 38 patterns can be downloaded in various formats and resolutions. Created by Paul Smith in 2025, with a GitHub link to obtain the patterns as device wallpapers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Using stipple patterns as wallpaper on modern Macs (e.g., via ImageMagick’s tile: pattern.png) can produce noticeable moiré artifacts if the display resolution isn’t exactly twice the panel’s native resolution.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests it’s perhaps a bit soon to repost an impressive history of Macintosh settings panels that include embedded emulated Macs, originally shared a few months ago. They invite readers to view the piece at https://aresluna.org/frame-of-preference/.

## 8. [E-Paper Display Refresh Rate Reaches New Heights](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45185756)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Summary: The text flags forbidden information about a Varnish cache server, identifying it as cache-sjc1000088-SJC and listing two numbers, 1757451187 and 2387326151.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 E Ink can update quickly, but LCDs are more power-efficient at high refresh rates. Moving the heavier ink particles in E Ink consumes more power, and faster updates draw even more energy; by around 75 Hz, LCDs are typically more efficient because LCD pixels act like capacitors that require little energy to charge or discharge. E Ink’s advantage is that when power is removed, the ink stays in place, saving energy afterward. Therefore, E Ink suits infrequent updates (like daily price changes), while LCDs excel with frequent refreshing.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author enjoys playing chess on an e-ink smartphone as a low-eye-strain evening activity and looks forward to coding on a colored e-ink desktop screen.

## 9. [Polylaminin, promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45187449)

## 10. [Mistral AI raises 1.7B€, enters strategic partnership with ASML](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45178041)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 Mistral AI announced a Series C funding of 1.7B€ at an 11.7B€ post-money valuation to advance AI research for strategic industries. Led by ASML, round includes ASML as lead investor and partners with backers such as DST Global, Andreessen Horowitz, Bpifrance, General Catalyst, Index Ventures, Lightspeed, and NVIDIA. ASML cites a strategic partnership to deliver AI-enabled products and research. Mistral AI will continue developing decentralized frontier AI to tackle complex industrial challenges, supporting enterprises and public sectors while preserving independence. CEO Arthur Mensch says the collaboration will advance semiconductor and AI value chain. The next chapter of AI is yours.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 ASML posted 2024 gross revenue of €28B and net income of €7.5B. It invested €1.3B of a €1.7B fund-raise, a substantial amount it cannot afford to lose. The move may reflect more than synergy with Mistral; it could be a strategic and/or political investment. Mistral is the EU’s leading AI company (excluding hardware firms), likely to receive EU support to compete with the US and China. If AI markets falter, the EU would want Mistral to survive. Funding it could win political favors while giving ASML a stake in a company unlikely to fail due to EU backing.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Despite widespread negativity, the article argues that conventional AI scaling has reached its limits. It suggests Mistral could deliver a breakthrough comparable to DeepSeek and urges optimism about the field’s future.
