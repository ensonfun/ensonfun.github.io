**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 Fakespot, a prominent fake review detection tool that aided millions of online shoppers since 2016, officially shut down on July 1, 2025. Acquired by Mozilla in 2023, it offered insights into unreliable reviews but faced sustainability challenges, leading to its discontinuation. Fakespot's technology highlighted that nearly half of Amazon's best-selling products had dubious reviews. Despite its popularity, Mozilla redirected resources to focus on core Firefox features and AI innovations. In response to the closure, a new tool called TrueStar is being developed to continue Fakespot’s legacy in trustworthy review analysis.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Screen readers for blind users provide a linear view of web pages and allow access to elements like headers and links independently. However, if all links are labeled "click here," it limits non-linear navigation, making it difficult for these users to understand the context and purpose of each link.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author argues against the notion that links should avoid using verbs. They provide examples where clear, action-oriented links like "click here" or "download Amaya" effectively direct users to download pages. In contrast, vague phrases like "Get Amaya!" fail to clarify links' purposes, suggesting references instead of downloads. The author emphasizes that action-oriented links enhance user understanding, particularly in contexts like downloading software, where clarity is crucial.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The current methods of measuring economic health are inadequate, as they do not reflect true job quality or income stability. For example, if someone loses a high-paying job but finds minimum wage work, the unemployment rate remains unchanged. Additionally, the metric overlooks individuals not actively seeking employment. "Full employment" is meaningless without assessing whether people can maintain a stable lifestyle, as economic vitality relies on consumers being able to afford nonessentials.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In June, goods-producing companies added 32,000 jobs, while the services sector lost 66,000 jobs, primarily in professional/business and education/health services. Job losses were most pronounced in the West North Central Midwest, South Atlantic, and Mountain states. Smaller mid-size and large companies were net hirers, but firms with 1 to 50 and 250 to 499 employees laid off workers. Year-over-year pay growth for job-stayers remained at 4.4%, while job-changers saw a slight decrease to 6.8%. Finance recorded the highest pay growth at 5.2%, and information services had the lowest at 4.1%.
