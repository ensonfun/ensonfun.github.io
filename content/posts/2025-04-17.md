Haskell effectively combines performance with developer-friendly abstractions, making it a compelling choice for concurrent programming.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In Haskell, exceptions can be thrown to other threads, and asynchronous exceptions are crucial for maintaining modularity due to the language's purity. Simons Marlow and Peyton Jones argue that semi-asynchronous methods can break synchronization and are incompatible with purely functional languages like Concurrent Haskell, where most operations are functional. Polling a global flag contradicts functional programming principles. Consequently, fully-asynchronous exceptions are both necessary and safe in functional settings, while they pose risks in imperative contexts. For further insights, Marlow and Jones's paper offers a detailed exploration of this topic.

## 10. [Adipose tissue retains an epigenetic memory of obesity after weight loss](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678138)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article explores the concept of "obesogenic memory" in adipose tissues, revealing that significant weight loss does not eliminate cellular transcriptional and epigenetic changes caused by obesity. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, researchers demonstrated that both human and mouse adipocytes retain these changes, which impair their function and contribute to rapid weight regain, a phenomenon known as the "yo-yo" effect. The findings suggest that persistent epigenetic alterations in cells may underlie long-term obesity challenges, indicating potential targets for improving weight management and health outcomes in obesity treatment.
