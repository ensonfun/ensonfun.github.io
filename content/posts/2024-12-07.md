### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes a project undertaken by the author at Sony approximately 25 years ago, where they were tasked with fixing the company's slow and frequently crashing Order Management System (OMS). The original system was a convoluted setup of shell scripts on an AIX server, comprising over 50,000 lines of code, with data transferred via FTP and managed through text files. The author decided to rewrite the system using Perl, which was seen as a practical solution at the time. Over three months, they managed to reduce the codebase to about 5,000 lines, significantly improving the system's performance and reliability. The author found the experience highly satisfying despite the initial complexity and poor state of the system.

 The article discusses the author's experience with writing a large Unix installer for the Entrust CA and directory system. This installer was designed to work across various Unix versions, adapting to the unique characteristics and variations of each. Key points include:

- **Scope and Growth**: The installer initially didn't support all Unix variants but expanded with customer needs.
- **Complexity**: While the basic installation was not overly complex, managing upgrades was challenging due to the differences in utilities across Unix versions.
- **Specific Challenges**: 
  - DEC's Unix was particularly confusing due to all command-line utilities truncating output at column width.
  - HP-UX had significant breaking changes across versions from 6.5 to 11.
  - Other Unix systems like Ultrix, Novell Unix, NeXT, Sequent, and AIX each had their quirks, with AIX being notably odd but specifics forgotten by the author.
  - Sun's operating systems (SunOS and Solaris) had differences, but they were supported by excellent field manuals (FMs).

The script also handled error detection, recovery, rollback, and a basic form of package and dependency management, illustrating the depth of customization required for compatibility across different Unix environments.

## 3. [Next-level frosted glass with backdrop-filter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42302907)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of the CSS `backdrop-filter: blur()` property to achieve a frosted glass effect in web design, which the author frequently uses in projects, including their blog. Here are the key points:

1. **Effect Demonstration**: The author shows how elements like a cupcake moving behind a header with `backdrop-filter` appear blurry, simulating the look of frosted glass, adding depth and realism.

2. **Common Issue**: The article points out a common oversight in applying this effect - the default Gaussian blur only considers pixels directly behind the element, not accounting for nearby elements, which doesn't mimic real-life frosted glass where light from nearby objects also affects the blur.

3. **Optimization**: To address this, the author suggests extending the blurred area beyond the visible element:
   - Move the `backdrop-filter` to a child element of the header.
   - Make this child element significantly larger than its parent to cover nearby elements.
   - Use CSS masking to trim the excess, ensuring the visual size of the header remains unchanged but the blur effect now includes nearby content.

4. **Learning and Credits**: The article credits Artur Bien and Jamie Gray for the original concept and provides a deep dive into CSS filters, showcasing how they can be applied not just to images but to any DOM node.

5. **Conclusion**: By making these adjustments, the frosted glass effect can be made more lush and realistic, enhancing the visual appeal and functionality of web interfaces.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue with using `height: 200%` in CSS for adding extra space needed for blur effects and suggests a more precise method for determining the necessary extra space. Here are the key points:

1. **Criticism of `height: 200%`**: The author argues that using `height: 200%` is not ideal as it might provide either too much or too little extra space for the blur effect.

2. **Calculating Extra Space for Blur**: The article references the filter effects specification to explain that a true Gaussian blur has infinite extent, but in practice, browsers use a three-pass box blur approximation. For a blur with a radius of σ, the extra space required is approximately 1.88 times σ. For a 16px blur, adding 32px (or close approximations like 30px or 31px) is recommended.

3. **Practical Adjustments**: The author suggests practical changes for CSS:
   - Replace `height: 200%` with specific inset values to accommodate the blur, like `inset: 0 0 -32px 0`.
   - Adjust the mask-image gradient to `calc(100% - 32px)` to account for the blur effect.

4. **SVG Filter Element**: The article mentions SVG's `<filter>` element which allows control over the rendering area via attributes like x, y, width, and height. However, it notes the limitation in CSS where you can't easily add an exact amount of extra height like `height="calc(100% + 32px)"`.

5. **Alternative in SVG**: It's suggested that using SVG with its `BackgroundImage` source could offer a better approach than CSS, although current browser support for `BackgroundImage` is lacking.

Overall, the article provides guidance on handling blur effects in CSS more accurately by calculating and applying specific extra space rather than using arbitrary percentages.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of information loss when data is processed through non-reversible functions. Here are the key points:

1. **Non-reversible Functions**: When data `x` is transformed by a non-reversible function `f`, some information is inevitably lost. This loss compounds with repeated applications of the function, `f(f(f(...f(x)...)))`, making the data progressively less informative.

2. **Random Data Injection**: Some implementations attempt to mitigate this by injecting random bits, but this is likened to a convolution operation with a distribution function `g` of the random data. However, even this method does not reverse the information loss since the convolution does not make the function reversible.

3. **Data Processing Inequality**: The author references this principle, which essentially states that processing data cannot increase its information content. This concept is used to formalize the idea that no matter how data is manipulated, information can only decrease or remain the same, not increase.

4. **Formal Calculations**: While the author mentions that there are formal calculations involving entropy and information channels that could explain this phenomenon in depth, they do not provide these specifics but suggest looking into the data processing inequality for further understanding.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the implications of training machine learning models:

1. **Ideal Scenario**: If a model perfectly captures the real-world probability distribution, further training would be unnecessary as the model already perfectly replicates reality.

2. **Practical Reality**: Since models are typically imperfect approximations of real-world data, continuous self-training can exacerbate errors. This process would amplify both common and rare events, leading to a compounded distortion of the original data distribution.

## 5. [Hiroshi Nagai: Japan's Sun-Drenched Americana](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42290663)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 Hiroshi Nagai, born in 1947 in Tokushima, Japan, became a prominent figure in the art world with his vibrant pop-style paintings that reflected themes of 1950s Americana. Despite initial rejections from art schools, Nagai pursued art in Tokyo, starting as a set decorator before gaining recognition for his illustrations. His work, inspired by American and British pop art, particularly resonated with Japan's City Pop music movement of the late 1970s and 1980s, which echoed the urban and relaxed vibes of Southern California's soft pop. Nagai's paintings, featuring blue skies, ocean views, and cityscapes, became emblematic of this era, designing numerous album covers and shaping the visual culture of City Pop. His influence continues today, as his art has been adopted by the vaporwave scene, which looks back nostalgically at the aesthetics of Japan's bubble era, showing the cyclical nature of artistic inspiration.

### Summary

 error

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the unique properties of white dwarfs, which are stars roughly the size of Earth but with a significantly closer habitable zone due to their smaller size and lower luminosity. Here are the key points:

1. **Size and Habitability**: A planet in the habitable zone of a white dwarf would be much closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, but due to the star's size, the white dwarf would still appear similar in the sky to how the Sun appears from Earth.

2. **Longevity**: White dwarfs cool over billions of years into black dwarfs. Over an extremely long period (more than 10^100 years), all elements in these stars would decay into iron-56, either through fission, alpha emission, or fusion, resulting in a cold, stable mass of iron.

3. **Life and Technology**: The long-term stability of white dwarfs makes them potentially excellent hosts for life and advanced civilizations, suggesting they could be good candidates for structures like Dyson spheres, which could harness the star's energy over vast timescales.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses planetary formation and stability, particularly focusing on how planets form from accretion disks and are often subject to ongoing impacts from debris. It highlights:

1. **Unique Solar System**: Earth's Solar System is unique because Jupiter, a gas giant, acts as a protective barrier, clearing much of the debris that could otherwise bombard Earth. This protection is not observed in other known planetary systems that have both Earth-like planets and gas giants.

2. **Impact on Earth**: The article notes the significant impact of asteroids on Earth, such as the event that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, suggesting that the presence of a protective gas giant like Jupiter might not be coincidental but crucial for life's stability.

3. **Habitability Factors**: Beyond just being in a habitable zone, the stability necessary for life over long evolutionary periods might also require a configuration similar to our Solar System, where a gas giant helps shield terrestrial planets from excessive cosmic debris. 

The article implies that for life to thrive and evolve over long periods, the planetary system's architecture, including the presence of protective gas giants, plays a critical role.

## 8. [Accessing a DRM Framebuffer to display an image](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42281193)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses testing methods for display interfaces on embedded devices, focusing on the differences between older and modern Linux drivers:

- **Older Method**: For framebuffer device drivers under Linux, particularly for devices like the iMX6 with proprietary drivers, one could use a simple command to show random data on the display, indicating if the display controller is functioning.

- **Modern DRM Interface**: With newer drivers like the upstream-based driver for iMX6, which uses the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) interface, this simple method doesn't work. Instead:
  - **CRTC**: Configures memory input to create an image, handling framebuffers and overlay planes.
  - **Encoder**: Converts the image data into signals compatible with display types (e.g., DVI, LVDS).
  - **Connector**: Identifies if a display is connected and its capabilities.

- **Testing Application Development**: The article outlines creating a test application for displays:
  - Access to DRM through `/dev/dri/cardX`.
  - Identify and configure resources like connectors, CRTCs, and framebuffers.
  - Use of a 'dumb buffer' framebuffer, which is accessible from the CPU for drawing simple graphics, but not optimized for GPU acceleration.

- **Practical Steps**:
  - Accessing and mapping memory for framebuffer manipulation.
  - Noting that while the framebuffer is set up, it isn't immediately added to the CRTC to display content.

The article provides a technical walkthrough for developers to test and understand display functionality on modern Linux systems using the DRM framework, with references to further resources like a talk by Maxime Ripard and a Github repository for practical application.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with porting their digital signage player, **info-beamer**, to the Raspberry Pi 5, focusing on the use of DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) and KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) technologies:

1. **DRM/KMS Support**: The Raspberry Pi has moved from proprietary Broadcom APIs to standard Linux DRM/KMS, which now offers solid support for these interfaces.

2. **KMS**: This allows for detailed control over video modes, useful when automatic detection isn't ideal or possible.

3. **Atomic API**: This feature of DRM enables multiple changes to the display (like video mode, plane positions, framebuffer assignments) to be committed simultaneously, preventing issues like screen tearing through atomic commits. There's also an option for a "test only commit" to ensure changes are valid before applying them.

4. **Video Decoding**: The article mentions the integration with FFmpeg on the Pi, which can leverage the hardware decoder to produce DRM framebuffers for video playback, allowing for zero-copy, high-performance video display.

5. **Writeback Connector**: A feature allowing the display output to be captured into a new DRM framebuffer, useful for functionalities like screenshot capture or feeding back into a video encoder.

6. **Documentation**: A noted frustration is the lack of comprehensive documentation on DRM/KMS, particularly regarding semantics, which is likely due to the niche nature of its use primarily by developers of desktop compositors and specialized video applications.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article clarifies that when "DRM" is mentioned in this context, it refers to **Direct Rendering Manager**, not Digital Rights Management which is often associated with content access restrictions.

## 9. [I algorithmically donated $5000 to Open Source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42312469)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article discusses an analysis of popular Python projects on PyPI, focusing on those with over 100,000 downloads in the last 12 months. It highlights the need for more transparent funding information for open-source projects, suggesting that initiatives like GitHub's `funding.yml` and FLOSS' `funding.json` are steps toward standardizing how funding data is presented to potential donors.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes a proposed initiative where the value of open source software (OSS) packages would be based on the number of downloads. Here are the key points:

1. **Exploitation Risks**: The author warns that such a system would be exploited by:
   - Creating fake downloads to artificially inflate download counts, increasing costs and necessitating countermeasures by package registries.
   - Developers spamming pull requests to popular packages to include their less popular packages as dependencies, thus gaining more downloads indirectly.

2. **Impact on OSS Maintainers**: This exploitation would place additional burdens on maintainers of OSS projects, who would need to manage increased spam and maintain package integrity.

3. **Gaming the System**: The author introduces a coined law stating that any metric with a financial incentive attached will be manipulated, potentially leading to negative outcomes for the OSS community. 

Overall, the article argues that while the idea might seem beneficial, it could ultimately harm the open-source ecosystem by encouraging unethical practices.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article praises open-source maintainers for their dedication and generosity, noting that while the author personally wouldn't contribute without financial incentive, they greatly appreciate the efforts of those who do.

## 10. [Mistakes as a new manager](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42341506)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article discusses the transition from being an Individual Contributor (IC) to a manager, particularly in the tech industry. Here are the key points:

1. **Delegation**: One of the biggest challenges is learning to delegate effectively. New managers often struggle with letting go of tasks they used to handle themselves due to a reluctance to trust others with their former responsibilities. Effective delegation is crucial for team and personal growth.

2. **Rewiring Satisfaction**: As a manager, the direct satisfaction from shipping products diminishes. The author suggests finding new sources of fulfillment, such as through team development, providing feedback, and seeing team members grow.

3. **Team Size vs. Quality**: There's a common misconception that a larger team size equates to greater managerial success. Instead, the focus should be on the quality of work and fostering an environment where team members can excel, rather than just increasing headcount.

4. **Engagement Level**: Finding the right balance in project involvement is critical. The concept of "Guided Autonomy" is introduced, where managers set goals and expectations but allow teams the freedom to find their own paths to achieve them, avoiding micromanagement.

5. **Perception Management**: As a manager, your work is less visible, and part of your role involves managing how others perceive your contributions. This includes ensuring your team understands your new role and communicating your team's achievements to external stakeholders to highlight your leadership's impact.

The article emphasizes the shift from individual achievements to facilitating team success, the importance of trust and autonomy in management, and the need for new managers to adapt their sources of professional satisfaction and visibility.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights a common mistake among new managers: avoiding difficult conversations with their team members, especially those they previously worked alongside as peers. This reluctance to engage in honest feedback stems from a desire to remain liked, but it leads to team dissatisfaction and underperformance. The key insight shared is the need to address specific behaviors and outcomes rather than personal attributes. For example, instead of labeling someone as "sloppy," a manager should point out specific issues like "quality issues in your code" and involve the team member in finding solutions. This approach not only improves team performance but also increases respect and appreciation for the manager.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept that everyone in an organization, regardless of their position, should be viewed as an **individual contributor**. Here are the key points:

1. **Individual Contribution**: Every role, from janitor to CEO, involves individual contributions. If someone isn't contributing, their role in the organization is questionable.

2. **Delegation and Management**: The author suggests that a primary reason for someone to shift into management might be because they can no longer or no longer wish to operate at the highest mental speeds required for certain tasks. Managers contribute by applying their experience and lessons learned, while delegating the fast-paced tasks to those who are naturally quicker or younger.

3. **Critique of Management**: The author expresses a personal dislike for management, noting that the role often involves a slowdown in problem-solving speed due to the nature of managerial tasks like meetings and group discussions. This environment can trap even intelligent individuals into a slower, less effective mode of thinking due to social dynamics. 

The article critiques the traditional management structure and emphasizes the importance of recognizing and utilizing individual capabilities and contributions effectively within an organization.
