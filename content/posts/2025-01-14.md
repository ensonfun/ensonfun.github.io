1. **Detection**: The author routinely checks for malicious packages and discovered several suspicious packages deployed by an NPM user named "sn4k-s3c". These packages had names suggesting they were aimed at Cursor.

2. **Malicious Intent**: The packages, named "cursor-retreival", "cursor-always-local", and "cursor-shadow-workspace", were designed to collect sensitive system data, including configuration options and credentials, and send this information to an attacker-controlled server.

3. **Identification and Response**: The OpenSSF package analysis scanner flagged these packages, and advisories were issued. However, initially, these packages were not marked as malicious on NPM, meaning security tools would not automatically protect against them.

4. **Source of the Attack**: Metadata from the NPM packages pointed to Snyk Security Labs, indicating that an employee or someone with access to Snyk’s systems might have deployed these packages. The authenticity of the metadata was verified by the use of a Snyk email address.

5. **Post-publication Actions**: Following the public disclosure of this incident:
   - The Snyk researcher involved took the packages offline.
   - Media coverage ensued, with The Register reporting on the removal of the packages.
   - Snyk responded via a blog post, defending their actions and explaining their research intentions.

6. **Recommendations**: The article advises caution when installing NPM packages, highlighting signs of potential malicious packages, such as having only two files (package.json and index.js or main.js).

This incident underscores the ongoing risks in software supply chains and the importance of vigilant cybersecurity practices in software development environments.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a security issue potentially involving Cursor, a company that might have a private NPM registry. Here's a summary:

- It's suggested that Cursor uses a private NPM registry for its packages, but there's a risk of misconfiguration where NPM might fetch packages from the public registry instead, which could be exploited by attackers.
  
- A Snyk employee might have uploaded packages to the public NPM registry as a proof of concept (POC) to demonstrate this vulnerability. The package description indicated it was "for Cursor," implying the employee could have been hired to test this security flaw.

- The article speculates that if this was indeed the case, the demonstration of vulnerability through a misconfiguration means there isn't much to see beyond proving the concept, as the security researcher would not use the private registry to show the flaw. 

- It also references a blog post by Snyk that discusses how dependency confusion attacks can occur, where a higher version number in the public registry can override the private one, leading to potential security breaches.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 2. [Lines of code that beat A/B testing (2012)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42650954)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 The article critiques the conventional A/B testing methodology, which it describes as fundamentally flawed due to its similarity to clinical trials where half the participants don't receive the potentially beneficial treatment. Instead, the author discusses an alternative approach inspired by the multi-armed bandit problem, a concept from machine learning and decision theory:

1. **A/B Testing Critique**: The author argues that A/B testing, where users are divided into two groups to test different versions of a product, inherently disadvantages one group by not exposing them to potentially better options.

2. **Development in Advertising**: Instead of focusing on more pressing issues like curing diseases, many intelligent minds are optimizing online advertising techniques. However, these advancements haven't significantly improved mainstream tools like Google Analytics.

3. **Proposed Solution - Multi-Armed Bandit Approach**: The article introduces a method where instead of testing two options, multiple options can be tested simultaneously. This method involves:
   - Choosing between exploration (random selection) and exploitation (choosing the option with the highest expected reward). 
   - Using an algorithm (like the epsilon-greedy method) to dynamically decide which version to show to users based on past performance, thus potentially optimizing results faster and more effectively than A/B testing.

4. **Implementation**: A simple 20-line code change can implement this strategy, allowing for continuous testing and adjustment without manual oversight. The algorithm tracks the performance of each option and adapts over time, removing the need for constant human intervention.

5. **Efficiency and Autonomy**: This approach not only handles multiple options but also allows for the addition or removal of options at any time, and it runs autonomously, adapting to new data in real-time.

The article concludes that this method can significantly outperform A/B testing, offering a more dynamic and efficient way to optimize user interactions on websites or apps.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of A/B testing in tech companies, highlighting its rarity in its purest form where the goal is solely to optimize through extensive experimentation due to the need for significant user traffic and resources. Instead, A/B testing is often used as a "political technology":

- **Technical and Political Derisking**: A/B tests allow teams to introduce changes to core functionalities of a site or app with minimal risk. If the change does not perform well, it can be quickly reversed, reducing the risk of failure.

- **Change Implementation**: By framing changes within an A/B test, teams can justify the implementation of new features or modifications that have been deemed valuable during the development phase, whether for technical improvements, branding, or other strategic reasons.

- **Practical Use**: Rather than numerous tests with minor variations, A/B testing typically involves comparing just two paths (the original and the new change) to ensure that major updates to critical workflows do not negatively impact the platform before rolling them out to all users. This approach is more common because it addresses the practical needs of businesses wanting to innovate without jeopardizing their service.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a limitation of the standard Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms when applied to environments like e-commerce, where reward rates (e.g., conversion rates) are not constant but fluctuate. Here are the key points:

1. **Assumption of Fixed Reward Rates**: Traditional MAB algorithms assume that the reward rates for different options remain constant, which is often not the case in real-world scenarios like e-commerce.

2. **E-commerce Example**: The author illustrates with an example where an e-commerce site runs a MAB on two variants (control and treatment). Initially, the treatment might be sampled more often. If a sale starts, increasing the conversion rate for both variants, the treatment's higher sampling rate could lead to a disproportionate increase in its perceived effectiveness, skewing the MAB's decision-making process.

3. **Impact of Fluctuating Rates**: In e-commerce, fluctuating rates can destabilize the MAB's proportions, potentially causing it to favor the wrong variant due to external factors like sales or seasonal changes, not because of inherent superiority.

4. **Advanced MAB Approaches**: There are more advanced MAB algorithms that account for changing reward rates by modeling additional uncertainty, leading to more conservative optimization strategies.

The author critiques the simplicity of traditional MAB models in dynamic settings and suggests a cautious approach when implementing these algorithms in environments with variable reward rates.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of using embedding-based searches in code assistant applications, particularly for code-related tasks. The author, who has built RAG (Retrieve, Augment, Generate) apps for clients, argues that code, due to its structured nature, should be navigated using a tree-like structure or Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) rather than simple embeddings. This approach mimics how human coders work by traversing up and down the code tree to find relevant pieces for specific tasks, which would integrate well with an agent loop for better context retrieval.

The author expresses surprise and disappointment at the lack of open-source code assistants or plugins that utilize this method. Most known projects like Cursor, Cline, or Continue rely on embedding searches. The article references a few research efforts and projects:

1. **RepoGraph** - A project on GitHub that likely deals with representing code as a graph.
2. **CodeGraph** - Mentioned in an arXiv paper, suggesting an approach to represent code in a graph format.
3. **Advanced Coding Assistant** - An open-source project by Deutsche Telekom which might incorporate advanced techniques for code navigation.

The author implies that while there are some research initiatives, the broader application of ASTs or tree traversal in code assistants is underrepresented in the current market.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article critiques the current market focus on vector databases for handling large datasets, pointing out that the real efficiency and cost savings lie in using fine-tuned embeddings. The author argues that fine-tuning embeddings for specific applications (like insurance) can reduce costs dramatically, by allowing for less detailed vectors which are sufficient for specific use cases. They suggest that companies like Voyage should develop models tailored to particular industries to capitalize on this efficiency.

## 8. [1 in 5 online job postings are either fake or never filled, study finds](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42697783)

**Total comment counts : 52**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of job hunting, exacerbated by a phenomenon known as "ghost jobs." According to a study cited by The Wall Street Journal, about one in five online job postings might be fake or never filled, based on data from the hiring platform Greenhouse. These ghost jobs not only frustrate job seekers like Serena Dao, who applied to over 260 jobs in a year, but also serve corporate strategies to project an image of growth or meet hiring quotas without actual hiring. This practice has led platforms like Greenhouse and LinkedIn to introduce job verification services to distinguish between real and misleading job ads. The article also touches on broader issues like the use of AI in job postings and other unrelated tech news, but the core focus remains on the deceptive nature of many job listings and its impact on job seekers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the practice of creating fake job postings due to U.S. immigration policy, specifically related to the H1B visa and the process of obtaining a green card. Here are the key points:

- **Reason for Fake Postings**: Companies create these fake job ads to support the green card application of an existing employee on an H1B visa, complying with the requirement to show that no qualified U.S. workers are available for the position.

- **Process**: The job postings must list legitimate job requirements, which means they cannot be specifically tailored to match only the current employee's qualifications. This leads to the situation where the company must interview and reject several U.S. applicants to fulfill legal obligations.

- **Impact on Hiring**: In specialized fields like finance, where the search for talent is typically global and rigorous, this practice can distort the hiring process.

- **Personal Experience**: The author mentions having likely applied to such a fake role earlier in their career, highlighting that recruiters might have insider knowledge to steer candidates away from these postings. 

This practice reveals a loophole in immigration policy that affects job seekers and potentially the fairness of the hiring process in certain sectors.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the various reasons behind the high rate of job postings that do not result in hires ("non-fill"). The reasons include:

1. **Passive Posting**: Companies might keep job postings active not because they are actively seeking candidates, but to remain open to exceptional applicants who might apply unexpectedly.

2. **Unsatisfactory Applicants**: Employers might remove a job posting if it does not attract the quality of candidates they are looking for, leading to a new job posting with potentially different criteria.

3. **Pre-determined Hiring**: Some positions are posted due to legal requirements or company policy, but decisions have already been made about the hire, often favoring internal candidates, those with connections, or candidates eligible for H1B visas.

4. **Variety of Other Scenarios**: The author suggests there are numerous other reasons why job postings might not lead to hires, implying that the job application process can be complex and not always transparent or merit-based.

This insight reflects the experiences of job seekers who, despite applying to many suitable positions, often receive no feedback, highlighting inefficiencies or other priorities in the hiring process.
