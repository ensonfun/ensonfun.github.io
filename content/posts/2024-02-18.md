## 1. [Wddbfs â€“ Mount a SQLite database as a filesystem](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39417503)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the hesitation of using a sqlite database for prototyping projects and suggests using a filesystem instead. The author introduces a utility called wddbfs that allows users to mount a sqlite database as a WebDAV filesystem. This allows the database to be accessed using tools that work with a standard filesystem, such as terminals, file managers, and text editors. The utility supports reading tables as CSV, TSV, json, and line-delimited json files. However, there is currently no write support and it may not work well for large database files.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article suggests that WebDAV is a better choice than FUSE for certain purposes, as FUSE can be buggy and poorly-implemented. They also argue against allowing writes, unless a clean way to handle them can be found. The author mentions their main use-case, which involves small databases and the difficulty of querying all tables. They propose fusing two models together and suggest allowing queries or virtual tables to sit on the file system. They also mention some half-baked thoughts on making files and tab completion work.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a project on GitHub called SQLiteDAV, which is a mapping system that assigns directories and files to tables, rows, and cells in an SQLite database.

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses a paper published by the Center for AI Safety on "Representation Engineering," which involves calculating a "control vector" that can be added to model activations during inference to interpret or control the model's behavior without prompt engineering or finetuning. The authors primarily focused on areas such as determining if a model is power-seeking and experimenting with adding a happiness vector to make the model act giddy. The article also mentions the release of code on Github and raises questions about the comparison between control vectors and prompt engineering, the creation of control vectors for different states, and the availability of a PyPI package for making control vectors. It goes on to explain that a control vector is a vector that can be applied to model activations to control the model's behavior without additional prompting. The article provides examples of control vectors and describes the process of generating them using principal component analysis (PCA). Overall, the article highlights the potential of control vectors in controlling AI models' behavior.

## 3. [Science fiction authors were excluded from awards for fear of offending China](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39415234)

**Total comment counts : 48**

### Summary

 Leaked emails reveal that organizers of the Hugo Awards excluded multiple authors from shortlists last year due to concerns that their work or public comments could be offensive to China. Authors such as Neil Gaiman, R.F. Kuang, Xiran Jay Zhao, and Paul Weimer were deemed ineligible as finalists, despite earning enough votes. The emails showed that organizers were worried about how some authors might be perceived in China, where the Hugo Awards were held in 2023. The organizers of the 2024 Hugo Awards, taking place in Glasgow, have acknowledged the loss of trust and are working towards transparency. Last year's Hugo Awards received criticism for being held in China due to allegations of abuses against Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups. The leaked emails reveal that organizers analyzed authors' published works, book reviews, and social media histories for potential negative perceptions of China. Some books were excluded simply because they took place in China, while other authors were disqualified based on supposed travel to Tibet. Critics argue that this vetting process goes against the spirit of the Hugo Awards and science fiction itself. The emails were released by awards organizer Diane Lacey, who admitted her mistake and apologized for her actions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The organization behind the Hugo Awards, Worldcon Intellectual Property, has announced resignations and censures in response to various actions and comments. Dave McCarty has resigned as a Director, Kevin Standlee has resigned as Chair of the Board of Directors, and both have faced censures for their actions. Chen Shi and Ben Yalow have also been censured for their involvement in the Hugo Administration Committee. Additionally, Standlee has been reprimanded for public comments that created misconceptions about the organization's services.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a situation involving censorship in relation to the Hugo Awards, specifically regarding works focusing on China, Taiwan, Tibet, or other sensitive topics in China. The author, Lacey, admits to vetting nominees for fear of backlash and mentions a desire for the awards to proceed without incident. This suggests that censorship may have been excessive due to fear. The article concludes by questioning whether there are alternative solutions to addressing authoritarianism in that region without resorting to violence.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article explains the process of cleaning plutonium surfaces before welding. It mentions that oxide and foreign material can be removed by wire brushing, sanding, or using an abrasive wheel. Additionally, it mentions a large dump site where tools, consumables, workspaces, and ductwork contaminated with plutonium dust were buried. The dump site is said to be large enough to contain the Empire State Building, and it is mentioned that machines like forklifts were simply pushed into it. The article provides a link to the dump site and a reference book for more information.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the unique properties of plutonium, most of which can be attributed to its mixed valent character. Plutonium's electrons in its partially filled 5f shell hybridize with the valence electrons in the solid phase, resulting in some properties that resemble valence electrons and others that resemble core electrons. This is similar to cerium and other lanthanide elements that exhibit a range of allotropes. These peculiar properties of plutonium lead to various exotic physics effects, such as heavy fermion metals and novel superconductivity, which are unrelated to its well-known use in nuclear weapons.

## 8. [Why is everything based on likelihoods even though likelihoods are so small?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39418632)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of likelihood in statistics. It explains that although likelihood values can be very small, their utility lies in their relative comparison rather than their absolute values. Likelihoods are used to compare different parameter sets and find the parameters that make the observed data "most likely" relative to others. The article also mentions that statisticians often work with the log of the likelihood to make the values more manageable and the optimization problems easier to solve. Additionally, it suggests using likelihood ratios and examining the likelihood plot as helpful tools in analyzing the data.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the usefulness of likelihoods and their relationship to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). It acknowledges that individual likelihoods may be small, making it unlikely for an MLE solution to be correct. However, the idea is that a significant portion of the probability mass is concentrated around the maximum likelihood estimate, making it a good estimate and worth using. It compares this concept to how the average is not likely to be the exact value of a new sample from a distribution, but it provides a good way of describing what to expect. The article also briefly mentions the importance of considering dispersion in conjunction with the average.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains why probability density functions are useful for representing probabilities. It uses the example of a yard stick to show that the probability of measuring exactly 1.0000000000000 yards is very low, but the probability of measuring within one inch of that is high. It suggests that using probability density functions where most of the density is close to the maximum likelihood is preferable. In the yard stick example, the lengths are likely to follow a Gaussian distribution, with a mean value close to 1.00000000000 yards and a small standard deviation.

## 9. [The Early History of Usenet (2019)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39408657)

The author plans to write a series of blog posts on the topic, covering various aspects such as the technological setting, hardware, economics, file format, user experience, authentication, norms, public announcement, Usenet growth, and more. The article also provides a URL to access an index of all blog posts on Usenet history.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recalls their first introduction to the Internet in 1990, when FTP and Usenet were popular. They found Usenet particularly exciting, as they could find newsgroups for various topics and even received a reply from someone at JPL. However, Usenet later fell out of favor due to the rise of the World Wide Web and difficulties with scalability and user understanding. The author mentions Facebook as a modern alternative, but finds it overwhelming. Interestingly, the author still uses NNTP (News) daily for a community that values minimal moderation and quickly deals with trolls. The author concludes that, ultimately, the people in an online community matter more than the specific technology used.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author recalls their experience connecting to the internet in the early 1980s. They learned Unix by using an emulator and eventually convinced their company to buy a Sun workstation. They had to rely on reading source code and instructions to connect to the internet. They discuss the challenges of using UUCP mail and the need to specify each step in the relay. The early internet community was respectful and provided accurate information. However, as more people joined, there were issues with spam, trolls, and the creation of newsgroups. Eventually, the web was implemented.
