**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The Ollama Python and JavaScript libraries have been released, allowing developers to integrate new and existing apps with Ollama easily. These libraries provide the same features and functionality as the Ollama REST API. Both the Python and JavaScript libraries support the full range of Ollama features. Examples of usage can be found in the GitHub repositories for these libraries. The main Ollama repository, along with these libraries, can now be found in a new GitHub organization called "ollama". Additionally, there are various community libraries available for interacting with Ollama using languages such as Dart, Swift, C#, Java, PHP, and Rust, among others. The community is encouraged to contribute by adding new libraries via pull requests. Special thanks are given to Saul and other community members who have contributed to making Ollama more accessible in different programming languages.

 The author of the article is discussing their experience with using Ollama, a service that allows for easy model deployment. They wanted to use Ollama in their project, FreeChat, but couldn't figure out a way to make it work without asking the user to install it first. Instead, they ended up bundling the llama.cpp server into their project. The author expresses their desire to eventually swap it out for Ollama and have it be embeddable in Swift. They congratulate the Ollama team on the release of their service.

### Summary

 Apple has announced changes to its iOS, Safari, and App Store in the European Union (EU) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These changes include new options for app distribution and payment processing for developers, as well as new controls and disclosures for users to reduce privacy and security risks. Apple will introduce safeguards such as Notarization for iOS apps, authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures on alternative payments to mitigate the risks associated with the DMA. However, some risks, such as malware, fraud, scams, and exposure to illicit content, will remain. These changes will be available to users in the EU starting from March 2024. Apple is committed to delivering the best and most secure experience for EU users while complying with the DMA's requirements.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the inclusion of anti-circumvention provisions in the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). The author suggests that based on these provisions, the EU could potentially pursue legal action against Apple's new rules. Article 13 of the DMA states that gatekeepers (such as Apple) should not engage in any behavior that undermines compliance with obligations, and if they do, the Commission can open proceedings and specify measures for the gatekeeper to implement.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the new fee structure implemented by Apple for app developers in the EU. According to the new structure, even if an app does not generate any revenue, developers will still be charged a minimum of $45,000 in fees for 2,000,000 installs. This is a significant increase from the previous fee of $0 USD.

## 3. [Brains are not required to think or solve problems â€“ simple cells can do it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39127028)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 I'm sorry, but the text you provided does not appear to be an article. It seems to be a server cache detail. Could you please provide an actual article for me to summarize?

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two traps to be aware of. Firstly, the term "bioelectricity" is generic and doesn't fully capture the complexity of charge and chemical gradients in cells. While applying an external electrical voltage can interact with biological systems, it is less precise than the natural depolarization process. Secondly, the ability to affect a system by one means does not necessarily mean that it is the cause. For example, transferring memory through RNA takes time to take effect, unlike synaptic remodeling in a trained animal. The article emphasizes that multiple systems work together to produce behaviors and it is important to recognize the complexity and interplay of these systems.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the spreading influence of Levin's ideas and discussions in the field, particularly in relation to the concept of intelligence at the single cell and tissue levels. The author finds it interesting that this perspective is not commonly considered in the medical field, which typically focuses on genetic and biochemical factors. They hope that this new perspective will lead to better medical treatments.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article highlights that, despite being outdated now, the use of tables to vertically center elements was the only method available for a long time. The author suggests that the productivity cost of not being able to easily vertically align elements in divs over the past 30 years could be significant. The author also mentions the fading of the overline style on hover links, which was popular during the era of Internet Explorer 4 or 6. Additionally, the article mentions the use of tables to create divs and buttons with rounded corners, which was common until the 2000s but required manual design and splicing in programs like Photoshop.

## 6. [Faircamp is a free Bandcamp alternative](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39129155)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 Bandcamp, a popular music platform, has faced uncertainty and laid off half of its employees after being sold to Songtradr. This has left many artists searching for alternative platforms. While there isn't a Fediverse solution available yet, the Faircamp project aims to help musicians by offering a self-hosted static site generator. Faircamp allows artists to customize their pages, set up payment options, offer freebies, and embed a player on other sites. The project has received positive feedback from the music community within the Fediverse. Radio Free Fedi has also provided a free service to help Fedi musicians host their own Faircamp sites. Faircamp is seen as a great alternative for supporting musicians in the Fediverse and may encourage the development of federated tools for creatives in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the strength of Bandcamp, emphasizing that its success is primarily due to its cultural significance rather than its technology. It highlights Bandcamp's communal experience through events, curation, interviews, and its presence at record fairs and events like Record Store Day. The article argues that the idea of federating and further distancing the connection between artists and audiences may diminish Bandcamp's appeal.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that a static site generator called "Keep in mind" is not actually a functional webshop because it lacks payment mechanisms. While it may not rival platforms like Bandcamp, it can be useful for hosting music tracks on a well-designed page.
