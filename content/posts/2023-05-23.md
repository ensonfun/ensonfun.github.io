## 1. [RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36038868)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary:

 ArXivLabs is a collaborative framework that allows individuals and organizations to develop and share new features on the arXiv website. These collaborators have accepted and embraced the values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy that arXiv is committed to. ArXiv only partners with those who adhere to these values and are willing to add value to the arXiv community. Users can receive status notifications via email or slack.

### Top 1 Comment Summary:

 The article discusses the ability of transformer models and RNN models to maintain attention and detailed memory across increasing context sizes. While recent models have been able to handle context sizes of 2k, 4k, and 8k tokens well, the author questions whether they can maintain granularity of detail and attention as context sizes increase even further, given that humans also struggle with such large amounts of information. The article also considers the possibility of using lookup steps to provide infinite context and precision, but the author is interested in the models' inherent memory and attention capabilities during a single forward pass.

### Top 2 Comment Summary:

 The author created a home-made neural network around 2006 which he wrote in Actionscript 3. It consisted of "neurons" that had trigger points to their neighbors and would light up based on the spark they got from them. The weights for the neurons would be re-randomized when their certainty values hit zero. While the network was limited to transforming 10x10 pixel bitmaps, it seemed to learn patterns. The author wonders what has changed about these concepts to make modern language models better.

## 2. [Why do recipe writers lie about how long it takes to caramelize onions? (2012)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36038796)

**Total comment counts : 90**

### Summary:

 The article exposes the lie in recipe writing where onions are said to caramelize in five or ten minutes. The author claims that it takes about 35 to 40 minutes to caramelize onions. Melissa Clark, the author of the NYT scone recipe, suggests a shorter method that takes 20 minutes; however, it still requires close attention to the pan on a medium-high flame. The recipe writers' impulse to deceive comes from the fact that browning onions is slow work, and it comes first, so they want to make the cooking time seem shorter. The article advises readers to start browning onions early, perhaps the night before, so that they are ready when needed.

### Top 1 Comment Summary:

 The article provides instructions on how to make caramelized onions - thinly slice 10 onions, cook them in oil on medium heat for 10-15 minutes, then turn down the heat and cook for a further 45-60 minutes until the onions are a deep brown color and their volume has reduced significantly. Stir frequently and deglaze the pan with water to prevent burning. The finished product can be stored in the fridge and enjoyed with any meal for the next few days.

### Top 2 Comment Summary:

 The article suggests that some writers may be using the term "caramelized" loosely when they actually mean the onions are lightly softened and translucent. This could be due to misuse of syntax rather than intentional deception.

## 3. [FBI misused surveillance powers more than 280k times in a year](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36041059)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary:

 error

### Top 1 Comment Summary:

 The article questions the implementation of a law that allows agencies to spy on non-Americans. The article suggests that agencies should have a good reason and a warrant to conduct such surveillance, otherwise, they should not be able to search anything.

### Top 2 Comment Summary:

 The article mentions that someone has been abused almost 280,000 times in a year, and suggests that the abuser is a habitual line stepper, who does whatever they want whenever they want. There is also a link to a YouTube video titled "Habitual Line Stepper."

## 4. [Apple announces multibillion deal with Broadcom to make components in the USA](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36044977)

The partnership will support over 1,100 jobs in Broadcom's Fort Collins FBAR filter manufacturing facility and will also see the continuation of investment in automation projects and training programs for technicians and engineers. The agreement is part of Apple's $430bn investment plan in the US economy, which was announced earlier this year.

### Top 1 Comment Summary:

 The article discusses the job opportunities offered by Broadcom at their Fort Collins site, including positions such as material handler, manufacturing operator, and several engineering roles with salaries ranging from $78k to $150k with equity. The article also references a book on the history of offshoring and globalization in Fab processes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary:

 Apple is developing a backup plan in case its supply chain is interrupted due to tensions with China. The company is creating redundancy by preparing to set up final assembly in other regions and ensuring that there is a supply of critical parts.

## 5. [Launch HN: Common Paper (YC W23) – SAFEs for Commercial Contracts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36043944)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary:

 The author discusses the frustrating and inefficient process of contract negotiation and management in the business world, and proposes a solution based on standardized contracts for buying and selling B2B software. The company, CommonPaper, provides these standard contracts for free and charges for the use of their software to sell to customers. The contracts are created and revised using an open-source model with input from a committee of attorneys. By standardizing contracts, CommonPaper is able to build software that can automatically generate invoices and subscriptions using Stripe, among other features, and make the contract negotiation process faster and more efficient.

### Top 1 Comment Summary:

 The article discusses Y Combinator's influence in setting a standard contract for startup investing through the Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE). The author questions how this type of standardization could be achieved in other types of contracts, particularly when dealing with larger parties who may have more leverage and be more resistant to using a standard contract. Additionally, the author raises concerns about the incentive for lawyers to use standard contracts, which could reduce their billable hours. Despite these challenges, the author expresses support for efforts to streamline the contract process and wishes good luck to those involved in this endeavor.

### Top 2 Comment Summary:

 The article highlights the potential market opportunity for a product offering contract lifecycle management features. While there is competition in this space, there are still many companies without a clear contracts process. The article also raises the challenge of working with Microsoft Word and the "track changes" feature which many lawyers prefer. The author suggests considering whether to integrate with Word or offer a solution that doesn't rely on it.

## 6. [Ableton Push 3](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36041432)

**Total comment counts : 41**

### Summary:

 The article is a summary of Ableton's Summit for Music Makers, which offers different resources for music producers. It showcases different tools such as a web-based synth with accompanying lessons, and a standalone instrument called "Push" that allows producers to step away from their computer and focus on the music. Push is an upgradeable instrument designed to last for years and features responsive and individually expressive pads. The article also highlights its user-friendly navigation, the ability to control output, and the flexibility to configure Push to meet individual budget and music-making needs. Furthermore, producers can upgrade Push using an Upgrade Kit in late 2023 for CNY 7200.00.

### Top 1 Comment Summary:

 The article discusses a thread on a tech forum where people are complaining about the performance of a PC running a specific product, while also having discussions about source code, APIs, and copying open-source products. Despite the lack of discussion about the actual product, the author notes that the video showcasing the product and its integration with a guitar was well-done, and wonders about the target market and the ease of repeating actions on the product.

### Top 2 Comment Summary:

 The article discusses the author's experience owning a Push 2 and having issues with the pads which led them to eventually sell it. The author is skeptical that the new Push 3 with more sophisticated pads will be any better. Additionally, the author finds it ridiculous that Ableton sells a barebones computer for $1,000 that can only be used for Ableton, and suggests that for that price an M2 iPad Pro would be a better investment due to its portability, longevity, and accessibility for repairs and replacements.

## 7. [SimCity 4 was released 20 years ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36038950)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary:

 SimCity 4, released in 2003, is still considered the best citybuilder game due to its simulation, scale, variety, and modding community. Its 3D terrain and sprite-art buildings look great today, and players can track the lives of individual Sims in their cities. SimCity 4 continued the formula laid down by previous SimCity games, but its Building Architect Tool enabled modders to extend the life of the game with custom buildings, maps, and mods. The Network Addon Mod (NAM), which fixed SimCity 4's traffic issues, is essential for any citybuilder game. While Cities: Skylines is a good starting point for new players, those tired of it or unwilling to buy more DLC should graduate to SimCity 4.

### Top 1 Comment Summary:

 The author prefers SimCity 2000 over SimCity 4 because it strikes a balance between simulation and fun, without overly complicating the game with micromanagement tasks. The added complexity in SimCity 4 doesn't bring any new strategies, instead just creating more busywork. SimCity 2000, on the other hand, is described as a solid and fun game that is well-balanced and enjoyable to play without cheats. The author suggests that players can relax and watch their city develop in SimCity 2000.

### Top 2 Comment Summary:

 Aspyr released an Apple Silicon version of SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition a few months ago, which is surprising considering the game's age.

## 8. [The AARD Code and DR DOS (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36042213)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary:

 The article discusses the AARD code, which was included in Microsoft's HIMEM.SYS driver and later used in Windows 3.1 beta. The code was designed to detect the presence of DR DOS, a competing operating system, and display an error message. The author, who was the first non-Microsoft person to learn how the code works, condemns its form but sympathizes with its function. The article explores the context of the code's creation and Microsoft's attitude towards DR DOS, and ultimately argues that while Microsoft's general disposition towards DR DOS was problematic, the AARD code does not constitute anti-competitive behavior and would not have been an issue if it had been implemented more transparently.

### Top 1 Comment Summary:

 The article reminisces about discovering Microsoft's Undocumented Features list in news groups and Geocities in the mid-90s. It mentions the writer's past experience with DOS programming and assembly programs. The article goes on to highlight the extensive list of dirty things that Microsoft did to other companies, with the DriveSpace debacle being the most memorable. It describes how Microsoft tricked a company that made a compressed filesystem driver to license a feature to them and then forgot to pay, leaving the company unable to recover what was legally owed. The article concludes by calling Bill Gates a "seriously dirty MFer."

### Top 2 Comment Summary:

 The author suggests that Microsoft broke anti-trust laws, but the Department of Justice was unable to properly prosecute the company due to lack of education. The author also mentions other tech companies like Google and Facebook engaging in invasive tracking of users across the web. The author expresses their hope that employees of these companies will one day be ashamed of their involvement.

## 9. [Microtiming in Metallica's “Master of Puppets” (2014)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36042732)

**Total comment counts : 45**

### Summary:

 Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot summarize this article because it only contains an error message generated by Mod_Security indicating that the requested resource could not be found on the server.

### Top 1 Comment Summary:

 The article discusses a common occurrence in music where bands sometimes adjust a song's timing to make it sound better, even if it doesn't follow the written time signature. This is seen in Metallica's early music and is also experienced by the author's death metal band who struggled to program a section with odd pauses that they had played evenly for a year. They ultimately decided to play it to the click and speed up the pauses to keep the song tight, although it took away from its personality.

### Top 2 Comment Summary:

 The article discusses the notion that Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica, is not necessarily a good drummer from a technical standpoint, but if the music sounds good, then it is good. The author also mentions how analysts often struggle to understand and analyze grunge or punk music, and that musicians in those genres may not have formal music training and instead rely on trial and error to find what sounds good. This approach may frustrate people with music degrees.

## 10. [Waymo and Uber partner to bring autonomous driving technology to Uber](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36043322)

**Total comment counts : 48**

### Summary:

 error

### Top 1 Comment Summary:

 The article discusses how Waymo needs to offer its own app to gain user trust, but also use the Uber app to show both options when they are available. This approach allows Waymo to gradually field a service, offer a lower SLA/SLO, and have an easier fallback plan if a Waymo vehicle takes too long to arrive.

### Top 2 Comment Summary:

 Waymo's integration with Uber enables them to have a slow rollout, starting by adding support one city at a time. The Waymo option only pops up for an Uber user if the ride requested is within Waymo's range and they have available cars. This allows Waymo to collect data about how users respond to the offers, affinity to driverless cars per region, price elasticity, etc. They can then increase or decrease supply as needed. Starting with their own app would be challenging due to low car supply and pending regulations, and customer-facing operations.
