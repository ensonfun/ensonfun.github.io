## 1. [Show HN: I made a discrete logic network card](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39976640)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's progress in building a complete computer system using discrete logic components. They have built a physical level adapter to convert Ethernet signals to SPI and back, and they are now implementing a MAC layer module to connect it to their homebrew computer. The receiver operation involves converting serial SPI data into a stream of bytes and writing them into a static RAM buffer. The received data and its length can be accessed using a system data bus. The transmitter operation involves counting bits and bytes, and it only supports frames of a fixed length. The frame transmission logic depends on a single bit of the byte counter.

## 5. [How I tripped over the Debian weak keys vulnerability](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39976225)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses an incident that occurred in March 2008, involving the deployment and security of SSH keys on GitHub. As GitHub began to gain popularity and their userbase grew, the standard method of managing SSH keys in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file became inefficient and caused slow SSH login times. To address this issue, the author, working at Engine Yard, proposed a solution to patch OpenSSH and store the keys in a MySQL database. The solution was implemented in early April and resulted in faster SSH logins. However, a month later, it was discovered that some users were able to access other users' repositories over SSH. Upon investigation, it was found that two users had keys with the same fingerprint, which should not have been possible unless the keys were shared. The incident highlights the importance of thorough testing and investigation when implementing changes to ensure security.
