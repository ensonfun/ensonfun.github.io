## 4. [Time-Based CSS Animations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40262236)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 CSS now has enough Math functions, such as mod(), round(), and trigonometric functions, to allow for animations based on time ticks. This time-based animation approach can be useful in shader programs and other areas. To track time in milliseconds, a custom variable can be defined with the CSS Houdini API. By incrementing this variable by 1 for each millisecond, animations can be created based on the change in the variable. The update frequency for smooth animations is typically set at 60 frames per second (FPS), but this can be manually controlled using the step() function if desired. The value of the variable can be restricted or manipulated using functions like min() and mod() to control the animation duration or create custom easing effects. The @t function can be used to represent the time variable in expressions, making the code more readable. CSS-doodle, a tool for creating animations, has also incorporated support for simple Math expressions. Overall, using time as a variable in CSS animations provides a flexible and diverse approach compared to traditional keyframe animations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article recommends using negative animation delay values in CSS if you want to control the progress of an animation using JavaScript. By using negative animation delays, you can start the animation immediately but jump to a specific time within the animation. Controlling this value with JavaScript allows you to effectively scrub through CSS animations, making them compatible with game-engine style compute-update-render tick loops. For more information, you can refer to the [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay) provided in the article.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of using basic easing functions and keyframes for advanced animation. The author recommends using Theatre.js, a library that consists of a studio UI and a runtime for editing and interpolating keyframes and bezier curves. The library is recommended for coordinated animations.

## 6. [Using a LLM to compress text](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40245261)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of extracting training text from large language models (LLMs) and using the models to reproduce text that they haven't directly been trained on. The author experiments with using the llama.cpp technology to compress and decompress text. They test it on the first chapter of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and achieve good compression results. The compressed text is only about 8% of the original size. The author also decompresses the text successfully. They conclude that while the method works better on data that the model has been trained on, there is still some reduction in size for other texts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a method for compressing data using the probability distributions generated by a Language Model (LLM) as output. The author mentions experiments conducted by Fabrice Bellard using transformers. The idea is that accurate probability distributions over the next bit/byte/token can be used for compression with entropy compressors like Huffman encoding, range encoding, and asymmetric numeral systems. These compression algorithms all rely on modeling probability distributions.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the process of pre-training compression on text without using a Language Model (LLM). It demonstrates how to pre-train compression using a normal compression algorithm called Zstandard (ZSTD) on a small training set. The article also mentions that for more efficient compression, it is recommended to train the algorithm on a larger dataset such as the entire Gutenberg library. Additionally, the article provides an alternative method using a sample of full texts and provides links to further resources for tuning and understanding Zstandard compression. The advantages of using Zstandard compression include smaller storage requirements, the ability to re-train the algorithm for specific data, deterministic compression and decompression, and minimal GPU resources usage.

## 7. [Understanding Stein's Paradox (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40261550)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses Stein's paradox, which is a surprising result in statistics. The paradox involves guessing the mean of a Gaussian distribution based on a single sample. In one dimension, the best guess is simply the sample given. However, in higher dimensions, a better guess is to use the James-Stein estimator, which is a function of the sample and the dimensionality of the Gaussian. The article explains the concept of parameter estimation and loss functions, and how different estimators can be evaluated using risk. The paradox highlights the importance of considering the dimensionality of the problem when choosing an estimator.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the arbitrariness of the origin in statistical estimation. It challenges the notion that the origin is not arbitrary by referring to the James-Stein estimator, which allows estimation to be pushed towards any chosen point. The author's conjecture involves imagining sampling points from a 3-D Gaussian distribution and adjusting them towards a chosen point using the James-Stein formula. The result is that, on average, the points move closer to the center of the distribution. The author questions the implications of this result and suggests that mean squared error as an error metric may not be meaningful.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that Stein's paradox is invalid. It provides an example from Wikipedia to illustrate the paradox, which suggests that simultaneously using unrelated measurements can provide a better estimate for a set of parameters. However, the article suggests that this idea is mathematically true but irrelevant in the real world. It claims that believing in this concept is comparable to believing in telepathy and astrology.

## 10. [Judge mulls sanctions over Google's destruction of internal chats](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40262190)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 During the closing arguments in the Google monopoly trial, US District Judge Amit Mehta considered whether sanctions were necessary due to Google's alleged destruction of evidence. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) accused Google of instructing employees to turn off chat history by default when discussing sensitive topics related to Google's revenue-sharing and mobile application distribution agreements, which the DOJ claims maintain Google's monopoly over search. The DOJ argued that Google destroyed potentially hundreds of thousands of chat sessions not only during their investigation but also during litigation. Google's attorney argued that the DOJ should have been aware of Google's policy and that there is no evidence that the missing chats would have provided new information. The DOJ requested the court to issue orders sanctioning Google, including presumptions that the deleted chats were unfavorable and that Google intended to maintain its monopoly. The DOJ also wants to prohibit Google from using the absence of evidence as an argument. The judge questioned Google's attorney about the company's intent and whether its conduct indicated an intent to hide evidence. The case continues.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights an important point that commenters have missed: The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandated Google to halt its auto-delete practices in 2019 due to anticipated litigation. However, Google did not comply with this requirement. Instead, Google shifted the responsibility of preserving potentially relevant chats to individual custodians, who failed to manually change the default setting from off to on. As a result, Google systematically destroyed a whole category of written communications every day for nearly four years.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Google has been accused of implementing a policy that encourages employees to turn off chat history when discussing sensitive topics, such as revenue-sharing and mobile application distribution agreements. The company did not ask employees to destroy evidence, but rather to avoid retaining it in the first place. While this approach is reasonable to prevent sensitive information from being logged or backed up, it may hinder legal proceedings.
