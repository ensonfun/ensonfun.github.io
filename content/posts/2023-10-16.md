### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that people who prefer command line interfaces over graphical admin interfaces are missing the point. While clickops and ssh may not be ideal for running a server, the author suggests that a server's state should be reproducible from scratch, and using GUIs like ssh or cockpit can lead to mistakes. The only reason to directly work on a server is for exploratory purposes, and in that case, the choice between GUI and command line is not clear-cut. GUIs provide discoverability and visibility, which can be advantageous when setting something up experimentally.

### Summary

 The National Research Council Time Signal, which has been broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) since 1939, was turned off on October 9th. The time signal, consisting of a series of "beeps" followed by a signal to indicate the top of the hour, was used in the past to synchronize clocks and watches. However, with the rise of modern technology and the availability of other time sources, its main use had become as a nostalgic reminder. The decision to turn off the time signal without prior announcement has received a predictable public response, with many questioning the reasoning behind the move.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the end of CBC's broadcasting of the National Research Council's (NRC) official time signal in Canada.

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The upcoming release of Go 1.22 is expected to enhance the pattern-matching capabilities of the default HTTP serving multiplexer in the net/http package. Currently, the multiplexer offers basic path matching, but the new version will bridge the gap from third-party packages by providing advanced matching. The article provides an introduction to the new multiplexer and compares it to the gorilla/mux package. The new multiplexer is straightforward to use if you are familiar with third-party mux/router packages. The article includes usage examples and highlights new features such as pattern matching and wildcard assignment. Additionally, the article discusses potential conflicts and precedence rules for pattern matching. It also mentions that the enhanced mux will likely shift the preference of beginner Go programmers towards using the standard library instead of third-party packages. However, some may still opt for more capable packages like gorilla/mux or lightweight frameworks like Gin. Overall, the article views the enhancement as positive for the Go community.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author finds it counter intuitive that in Go, panic is forced when two routes are matched, unlike other web frameworks that prioritize the first-to-be-registered route. They wonder if there are Go-specific reasons for this and suggest that the issue of registering routes in multiple places could be addressed with tooling. The author also mentions that they have relied on the behavior of "first to be matched wins" in their career for various business cases.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the Gorilla/mux project, a multiplexor for the Go programming language. Last year, the project was archived, leading the author to switch to another multiplexor called gin-gonic. However, upon seeing a mention of Gorilla/mux in a blog post, the author re-evaluated the project and found that it is no longer archived. This raises questions about the stability of the project, but also highlights the resilience and stability of open source projects. Additionally, the article mentions that similar functionality will be provided by Golang itself.

The author learns that signals are a way for Unix processes to communicate, but there are restrictions on what a signal handler can do. The article provides examples of important programs that use signals extensively, such as the init process, terminal resizing, and the JVM. The author also mentions the SIGSEGV signal and its various use cases. The article explores the use of signals in the stackprof Ruby profiling tool and discusses the potential issues and alternatives, such as using signalfd. The author concludes that signals can be used for important tasks as long as one is careful and aware of potential problems.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the technique used in garbage collected, multi-threaded virtual machines to signal threads to stop for garbage collection. In order to avoid allocating memory while the garbage collector runs, the runtime inserts dummy instructions called safepoints at the top of loops or function entry points. These instructions write to a page that the runtime controls. When it's time to stop all threads for garbage collection, the page is write protected. This causes each thread to eventually encounter a segmentation fault, signaling them to stop. Once all threads have stopped, the garbage collector can run smoothly. The write protection is then removed and the threads resume execution.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the origin and purpose of signals in Unix. The writers of Unix needed a mechanism for communication between the kernel and user mode code. Signals can be understood as interrupts for user mode instead of kernel mode. Different signals map to specific events, such as processor exceptions, I/O device interrupts, timer interrupts, and platform interrupts. Signals act as a one-shot downcall mechanism that can occur at any time, requiring careful consideration of concurrency and limited access to certain parts of the system. The author even mentions porting a real-time operating system to run on Unix user mode using signals as an interrupt controller abstraction.
