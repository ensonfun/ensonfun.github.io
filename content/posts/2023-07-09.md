## 1. [How small is the smallest .NET Hello World binary?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36652824)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The article explores the minimal amount of bytes required to store a .NET executable that prints "Hello, World!" to the standard output. The author sets arbitrary rules, such as using a managed entry point in C# or CIL, running on .NET Framework 4.x.x, and having no third-party dependencies. They then go through several optimization steps to reduce the file size, including disabling nullable reference types, removing unnecessary metadata and attributes, eliminating imports and base relocations, using ASCII strings instead of wide-character strings, and more. The final size of the binary is 834 bytes, which can be further compressed to 476 bytes when zipped. The author acknowledges that the project may be considered useless, but they enjoyed exploring the limits of the system.

## 9. [Don't Take VC Funding – It Will Destroy Your Company](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36654960)

**Total comment counts : 82**

### Summary

 The article discusses the misconceptions and potential pitfalls of seeking venture capital (VC) funding for startups. It highlights that receiving VC funding often means selling a part of the company and does not guarantee profitability. The article argues that VC funding changes the objective of the company from building it on one's own terms to building it for eventual sale. It also emphasizes that profitability becomes less important as arbitrary metrics and priorities take precedence in order to attract more investors. The author advises considering alternative methods, such as bootstrapping or starting as a consultancy, to build a company with more control and focus on profitability.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the potential outcomes of raising money from venture capitalists (VCs), which include failure, selling to an acquirer, or going public. The author suggests that if none of these end states align with your goals, it is not advisable to seek funding from VCs. However, the author also shares their positive experience of raising money from VCs, taking their company public, and generating significant returns for investors. While there are negative stories about VC funding, there are also success stories.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the reasons why startups seek funding, but it fails to mention one important reason - to grow faster than or keep up with their competition. The author believes that unless a startup is operating in a market with no competition, they need to closely watch their competitors. If competitors can expand, add features, and acquire more customers at a faster pace, it hinders the startup's chances of success in that market segment. Taking venture capital funding could potentially provide the necessary velocity to compete effectively. However, the author acknowledges that if the goal is to run a profitable business over the long term, taking VC money may not be a good idea. Ultimately, the decision depends on the founders' goals.
