### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author questions if there have been any applications of the "periodic table" as a visualization method for subjects other than chemical elements. They suggest that while there may be examples of grid or matrix formats that convey common properties, the use of the "periodic table" format is overused. The author suggests that if applied correctly, every Nth element along the X dimension should resemble each other, allowing for common properties along the Y dimension as well.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses confusion and criticism towards a visualization method that attempts to represent information in the shape of the periodic table of elements without actually utilizing the periodic structure of the table. They suggest that grouping the information by type using a tree structure would be more useful and interesting. The author also mentions the idea of a tree diagram representing the relationships of historical development and data structure behavior in relation to different tree data structures.

## 7. [SQLite: Wal2 Mode](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38988949)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 This article explains the features and differences between "wal" mode and "wal2" mode in SQLite databases. In "wal" mode, a writer appends new data to a separate file called the wal file, which is then copied into the main database file in a process called a checkpoint. However, if a writer writes to the database during a checkpoint, the wal file cannot be overwritten, leading to potential indefinite growth of the wal file in busy systems. 

In contrast, "wal2" mode uses two wal files, allowing writers to switch between them and checkpoint one file while writing to the other. This prevents the wal file from growing indefinitely even if the checkpoint process is interrupted. The main difference between "wal" and "wal2" mode is how checkpointing is handled. In "wal2" mode, the checkpointer has to wait for writers to switch to the other wal file before performing a checkpoint.

The article also mentions that using a wal-hook, registered using sqlite3_wal_hook(), can be used to implement checkpointing strategies for both "wal" and "wal2" mode databases. However, it notes that invoking the wal-hook from within the "COMMIT" command may reduce concurrency in systems using BEGIN CONCURRENT.

Overall, "wal2" mode provides a more efficient and reliable approach to handling write-ahead logging in SQLite databases compared to traditional "wal" mode.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The summarized article is about a new mode called "wal2" in a system that uses two write-ahead log (WAL) files instead of one. This mode improves efficiency by allowing writers to switch between the two files, checkpointing one file while writing to the other. The author finds this mode logical and wonders why it was not implemented earlier. They express anticipation for this mode becoming widely available.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the Bedrock branch of SQLite, which is described as being more interesting. Bedrock utilizes a combination of WAL2 and CONCURRENT techniques. Expensify, a company, has used this branch of SQLite to scale their system to handle 4 million queries per second on a single server. The article provides links for more information on Bedrock and Expensify's use of SQLite.

The focus of the talk is on the technical difficulties that are not widely discussed in literature and the mistakes they made so others can learn from them.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recalls their childhood obsession with designing a mini-submarine. They were inspired by a book on submarine history and the simplicity of the original Turtle submarine. The author incorporated features like a lead ballast, propellers based on electric trolling motors, a car battery, and ballast tanks for pitch trim control. They also experimented with mechanisms for gimballing the motors and different seating configurations. This fantasy, however, never went beyond the drawing board stage due to its impracticality. The author reflects on the intellectual and creative stimulation they may have gained from the project, as well as the potential escape it provided from boredom and isolation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author recalls hosting a human-powered submarine race while working for the Navy. The competition attracted university engineering teams and featured a variety of homemade submarine designs. The author found it entertaining to see the creative designs and noted that building a submarine that could be accurately steered under propulsion was more challenging than expected. Many participants failed to account for the fact that a submarine can roll in the water unless there are control surfaces or ballast to prevent it. While no one was lost during the race, a few participants had to be rescued by Navy divers.

## 10. [Slashing data transfer costs in AWS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38998516)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The article discusses the costs associated with data transfer on AWS and offers a workaround to avoid expensive cross-Availability Zone (AZ) data transfer charges. It explains that data transfer from AWS to the public internet incurs fees ranging from $0.09/GB to $0.154/GB. Transferring data between AWS regions can be even more costly, ranging from $0.02/GB to $0.147/GB. However, the article suggests using S3 storage as an intermediary to transfer data between EC2 instances in different AZs. By uploading the data to S3 and then downloading it from the other instance, users can avoid the cross-AZ data transfer costs. While the S3 storage has a cost of $0.023/GB per month, by designing the upload/download to ensure data does not persist in S3 for more than an hour, the total cost can be reduced to about $0.03 instead of the original $20.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Lightsail instances can be used to "proxy" data from other AWS resources, such as EC2 instances or S3 buckets. It explains that each Lightsail instance includes a certain amount of data transfer, with the $10 instance offering the best value by providing 3TB of traffic. The article also mentions that using the data provided, 3TB of traffic from an EC2 instance would cost $276.48, while 3TB of traffic from an S3 bucket would cost $69. However, it notes that using Lightsail instances has the downside of both ingress and egress traffic counting as "traffic".

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that there are various tricks available to reduce costs and obtain resources for free. However, these methods are not necessarily dependable. These tricks, similar to those used for crypto mining on GitHub actions through OSS repositories, can be seen as a form of hacking. The article advises treating these tricks as an interesting hacking exercise but warns against deploying them in a production environment without the approval of account managers, as there is a risk of having an AWS account terminated.
