**Total comment counts : 47**

### Summary

 The article discusses the importance of Git commit messages and provides an example of a well-crafted commit message. The author believes that commit messages are powerful tools for documenting a codebase. The example commit message, titled "Convert template to US-ASCII to fix error," is from the developer Dan Carley working on GOV.UK. The commit message is detailed and explains both what was changed and why. It includes information about the error that inspired the change, the process of investigating and fixing the problem, and the commands that were executed. The author emphasizes that commit messages like this are valuable for documenting the journey of the codebase and spreading knowledge within a team. Additionally, such messages remind us that every change has a human behind it. The article concludes by recommending further reading on the benefits of good commit messages and tools that can help structure changes around them.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author, a GitHub cofounder and author of Git books, argues that the Git commit message is an underutilized form of code documentation. The issue is that most tools only show the first line of the commit message, making the rest of the message unseen by most people. The commit message was originally meant to be read by everyone in the project, but in modern tools, only the first 50 characters are typically seen. It is difficult to access the full commit message, even for experienced Git users. The author complains that even though the commit messages in the Git project are of high quality, it is challenging to find and appreciate them. Overall, the author believes that writing thorough commit messages is often a waste of time as they are rarely accessed.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 8. [The theory of concatenative combinators (2007)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39203404)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 This article introduces a new theory of combinators, which are programs that manipulate data on a stack. The theory is inspired by the programming language Joy and focuses solely on manipulating programs as data. The article outlines several fundamental combinators such as swap, dup, and zap, which duplicate, rearrange, or remove items on the stack. It also introduces combinators like cat, cons, and unit, which restructure quotations. The article concludes by discussing the interconstructability of combinators and how they can be used to construct all other combinators.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the theory of combinatory logic and its simplicity in representing computable functions using the terms S and K. The author questions the need for concatenative combinators, which involve stacks and quotations, as they seem to complicate matters without providing any additional benefits. The article mentions that the concatenative combinators [C], [B], and [A] have analogues to S and K but do not form a complete basis. The author wonders what can be expressed using concatenative combinators that is not easily expressed in combinatory logic.

## 10. [A Plea for More Mikado](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39187487)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The Mikado Method is a framework for managing large refactoring projects or software upgrades. It involves breaking down the changes into atomic tasks and shipping each task individually. The process begins by upgrading a specific component or dependency and then running the unit test suite to identify failures. For each failure, a new task is created and linked to the parent task. The changes are then reverted, and one failure is addressed at a time, without the original upgrade. If additional changes or refactoring are required, they are written down and the process is repeated. Eventually, fixes will start to accumulate and reverts will decrease. The final step is to make the actual change to the codebase and ship the upgrade. It is important to have a reliable automated test suite for this method to be effective. While it is not necessary to strictly follow the method's steps, its core ideas of shipping atomic changes and dropping irrelevant tasks can be beneficial for developers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a specific implementation of the principle "Make the change easy, then make the easy change" in the context of email-based development. It suggests floating minor fixes and refactoring to the beginning of development series, allowing them to be checked in as they are reviewed. This approach reduces the final merge process by making it smaller.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author questions whether the Mikado Method is actually used in practice and how effective it is. They suggest that it may not work well in cases where a failure can only be resolved by introducing something new. The author also highlights that the assumption underlying the method is that the tests are sufficient, but in reality, the reason for needing a revert is because the tests are inadequate. However, the author still believes the method can be effective because when problems arise, it is possible to revert to the previous version while retaining most of the preliminary changes, thereby reducing the cost of the revert.
