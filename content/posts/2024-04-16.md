Overall, the Etak Navigator was a groundbreaking product that paved the way for modern navigation systems.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the Etak system of navigation used by Micronesian and Polynesian seafarers in the Pacific Ocean. The system involves navigating by stars and ocean swells to determine the heading, and using intermediary islands, called "etaks," to estimate the distance traveled. These etaks are not always visible and may not actually exist, but they are used as a mental model to externalize the navigator's intuition of how far they have traveled. The article concludes by mentioning that this system is described more roughly in the book "Cognition in the Wild" by Hutchins.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses the concept of using a server program as a torrent file builder, tracker, and file server. This program would allow a large organization to store a significant amount of public data on a server. Whenever the data changes, a torrent file would be created and served over HTTP, while the server itself acts as a tracker. The author then shares their experience of creating a Linux distribution for a bank, which utilized this concept. The distribution was self-seeding, allowing for the creation of multiple clones using wake-on-lan and PXE configured switches. The machines pulled a torrent from the server and acted as seeds once built. The author successfully deployed this system to 8000 machines across hundreds of bank branches in a few weeks.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is not convinced that certain people are the collective responsibility of society. They wanted to see percentages included in the visualization of the data. They were shocked by the large number of people with adverse experiences who still managed to go to college and earn a high salary, as well as the number of people with no adverse experiences who still ended up poor. The author believes that throwing resources at the issue could improve the lives of some people, but not most. They question how many people's lives could be improved and how much society is willing to sacrifice for that improvement.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the experiences of childhood can have a significant impact on the financial situation and overall quality of life of individuals in adulthood. It cautions against inferring causality from this data, stating that simply providing books to disadvantaged children, for example, will not necessarily lead to the same outcomes as their more privileged peers in all other aspects of life. The article highlights that factors such as witnessing violence and socioeconomic status play a role in these outcomes, and that the cycle of poverty can be perpetuated across generations.

## 7. [Knuth–Morris–Pratt illustrated](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40029469)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for string search and its difficulties in understanding. It introduces a new approach to explaining the algorithm using pictures to illustrate each step and employing elementary functional programming techniques. The article also discusses the naive approach to string search and presents a visual intuition for the KMP algorithm. It highlights the insights that lead to an optimal algorithm and emphasizes the importance of lazy evaluation. The article concludes with a description of a new algorithm based on vertical lines, which is a different approach to the problem.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm improves the process of searching for a string in a document by advancing more than one character after a failed match. It does this by utilizing knowledge of the search string and the position at which the match failed. For example, when searching for the string "explosion," if a partial match is found (such as "explo") but the match fails, KMP notes that none of the characters after the first letter are an "e." Therefore, instead of advancing by just one character, it can advance by five characters to start looking for the next "e." The algorithm pre-calculates the efficient amounts it can advance at each failed match position.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the Z algorithm, which is considered to be an easier alternative to the KMP algorithm. The author mentions that they can implement the Z algorithm easily, while struggling with the implementation of the KMP algorithm. They provide a link to an article that explains the Z algorithm in more detail.

## 8. [Weird monitor bugs people sent me in the last 5 years (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40038759)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The article discusses various bugs and issues encountered by users of the Lunar app for macOS, which allows for intelligent adaptive brightness and control of external monitors. One bug mentioned is the swapping of monitors after standby or restart, where the OS mistakenly assigns the wrong coordinates and settings to each monitor. This occurs when monitors have identical firmware and EDID structures, resulting in the same UUID being computed for both. The article provides workarounds for this issue. Another bug is the occurrence of monitors going black and becoming unresponsive when receiving specific DDC commands, which can be fixed by unplugging and replugging the power cable. The author speculates that the issue lies in the monitor controller firmware's DDC handler code. Additionally, the article mentions the disabling of XDR Brightness for external monitors by default due to issues with specific monitor models.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recounts a personal experience with a monitor, the Dell UP2414Q, that had a firmware bug. The bug caused the monitor to crash or display strange failure modes whenever it changed resolution while using MST (Multi-Stream Transport). The monitor would sometimes go black and require a power cycle to come back or display incorrectly on one side of the screen. The author speculates that the bug may be due to independent handling of decoding for different sections of the display. The author mentions that there is a newer version of the monitor, A01 rev, which doesn't suffer from these issues, but Dell doesn't provide a firmware upgrade for the older version. Eventually, the author traded the monitor with someone else, disclosing the reason for getting rid of it.
