 The article highlights a problem with brain implants that is not widely discussed - they decay over time. Scar tissue builds up around the electrodes, rendering them useless. This constant irritation and tissue damage is disliked by the immune system. Within months, significant decay occurs, and within 5-10 years, the majority of the implant becomes ineffective. Replacing the implant is not easy, and the damage to the area is irreversible. Despite ongoing research, there is currently no solution to make brain implants last longer for these treatments to become viable.

They explain that UIs can obscure the underlying operations of git, impose unrelated metaphors, and have limited functionality. However, the author now uses a specific UI called lazygit, which they find intuitive, comprehensive, and not heavily reliant on memorizing shortcuts. They compare lazygit to other UIs, which they found fragile and feared breaking. Overall, lazygit provides a visual representation of git's design and allows for easy interaction.

 The article discusses different options for setting up peer-to-peer multiplayer without the need to create your own server. It mentions Steam's Networking API, which has integration with the game engine Godot through GodotSteam. It also mentions Epic's NAT P2P API, which provides support for NAT hole punching with relay services as a backup. The article notes that while Steam used to use a peer-to-peer setup, they now primarily rely on relay services, which is more user-friendly as it helps protect users' IP addresses from being exposed to potential security risks like DDOS attacks. However, it also highlights that using relay services does mean that Steam has access to users' IP addresses.
