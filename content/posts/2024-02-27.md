## 1. [Airfoil](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39526057)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 This article discusses the physics of flight and how airplanes remain airborne. It looks at the shape and orientation of the airfoil, which is the cross section of the wings, and how it interacts with the flow of air. The article also explores the behavior and properties of air and other flowing substances. Visual representations, such as falling leaves and bending blades of grass, are used to demonstrate the effects of wind on objects and to help visualize the motion of air. Arrows representing the direction and speed of the airflow, as well as markers representing light objects influenced by the air, are used to further illustrate the concept.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article argues that flying objects fly primarily because of thrust, rather than wings. It points out that rockets and missiles are able to fly long distances without the presence of wings. The article also mentions that even though airfoils (wing shapes) and concepts like Bernoulli's principle and the Coanda effect are important, lift is ultimately dependent on the presence of thrust or velocity. It suggests that if the engines of a 747 were to shut down, the aircraft would descend rapidly.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how airfoils used in aircraft design were developed in the 1920s and 1930s by the NACA. Despite advancements in computer software, these airfoil shapes have already been perfected through manual calculations and experiments. Nowadays, designers can simply refer to a table of NACA airfoils based on their specific requirements for speed, air pressure, etc.

## 4. [I turned my open-source project into a full-time business](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39522348)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experiences with open-source software and their transition towards monetizing their projects. Initially, they only used permissive licenses and rejected donations, believing that reaching a wide audience was more important. However, they later realized that they were not benefiting financially from their work. They then released a new project, EmailEngine, under the copyleft LGPL license and implemented a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) process. They also offered a paid subscription for an MIT version of the software. However, this business plan did not yield significant revenue, so they eventually changed the license to a commercial one and introduced a license key system. This change resulted in increased revenue, and the author continued to increase the pricing without losing customers. The current monthly recurring revenue for EmailEngine is €6100 and continues to grow steadily.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The main point of this article is that the author noticed an increase in subscriptions for their software after they implemented a feature that caused the software to stop working without a valid license. The author suggests that while discussions about different license options may not be important to most users, in the corporate world, users are more likely to pay for a license rather than trying to remove the license check from the code.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article believes that companies are unlikely to pay for open-source software even if they find it valuable, since it is free. However, if the cost is relatively low, around $1,000 per year, companies are more willing to let developers purchase it without much hassle. This pricing is seen as ideal for solo founders who do not need to rapidly scale their operations. However, the situation becomes more complicated for enterprise sales, as the sales cycles are longer and the pricing structures are more complex.

## 5. [Segmenting comic book frames](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39518202)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's project in their Computer Vision class where they developed an algorithm for extracting frames from comic books. They first encountered an algorithm by Max Halford that used Canny to detect frame boundaries and fit bounding boxes, but it had limitations. To overcome these limitations, the author procedurally generated a synthetic dataset of comic books and fine-tuned a segmentation model called SAM to detect the corner points of frames. They used a procedural generator to create layouts and assigned random boxes filled with images from the Danbooru dataset. The author modified the SAM model to predict points instead of dense masks. They learned that canonicalizing the order of corner point predictions and using L1 loss improved the model's performance. Comparison with Halford's method and the original SAM method showed that the author's model performed well on both procedurally generated and real-world comics. The article concludes by acknowledging the shortcomings of the author's method but praises the approach of algorithm design over using OpenCV functions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a new challenge in artificial intelligence: inferring the intended panel reading sequence and the flow of speech bubbles/narrative in digital comic books. This could enhance digital comic book readers by allowing them to refocus from panel to panel in the correct order. Additionally, it could make comic book content more accessible.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In the past year, there has been an increase in YouTube channels that use AI to recap manga. It is likely that these channels utilize open source tools for panel segmentation.
