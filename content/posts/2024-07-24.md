## 1. [Anyone can access deleted and private repository data on GitHub](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41060102)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The article discusses a vulnerability on GitHub, where deleted and private repository data can still be accessed by others. This is known as Cross Fork Object Reference (CFOR) vulnerability and occurs when one repository fork can access sensitive data from another fork, including private and deleted forks. The article provides examples of how this vulnerability can be exploited, such as accessing code from a deleted fork or accessing commits made after forking a repository. The author also highlights the issue of inadvertently exposing confidential data and secrets on public GitHub repositories. GitHub's repository network design allows this data to be accessible even after certain actions, like deleting a repository, are taken. Overall, this vulnerability poses a significant risk to organizations using GitHub, and the article emphasizes the need for awareness and caution when handling sensitive data on the platform.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reported an issue on GitHub's HackerOne platform, stating that they discovered a vulnerability related to private forks. GitHub responded by acknowledging the finding as a known low-risk issue and stated that the functionality may be tightened in the future. However, GitHub did not consider the issue eligible for a reward under their Bug Bounty program. GitHub explained that in their "repository network," objects from one member are readable by other members. Blobs and commits are stored together, while refs are stored separately for each fork. GitHub removes a repository from the network when its visibility changes to prevent private commits/blobs from being readable by another network member. The author concludes that instead of using private forks, it is better to clone the repository.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author criticizes GitHub for considering a feature called "private" as a deliberate choice rather than a bug, and views it as a lack of concern for security. They argue that privacy features should always have a strict and safe default. In the meantime, the author suggests referring to "private" repositories as "unlisted" instead.

## 2. ["Doors" in Solaris: Lightweight RPC Using File Descriptors (1996)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41053761)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article is about door descriptors in UNIX systems. Doors are descriptors used to describe a procedure in a process and can hold additional state associated with the procedure. They were originally designed as object descriptors in C++, but can be used to pass capabilities and invoke services across different processes. During a door invocation, the client thread migrates to the server process and executes the procedure, then returns to the client with results. Data, including other doors, can be passed as arguments and returned as results. The doors interface allows for high-performance multithreaded programs by handling the creation and dispatching of threads based on load. Doors are implemented as file descriptors in order to easily adopt existing UNIX paradigms and provide a secure mechanism for encapsulation. The article also mentions the naming facility available with file descriptors and how doors can be named in a similar manner. The doors interface is exported from a user-level shared library and controls the creation of server threads. A new synchronization object called a shuttle is used to encapsulate the state associated with a door invocation. Server threads are created on-demand and use the Solaris thread library. Benchmark results show that doors perform faster than other existing UNIX IPC mechanisms.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article addresses misconceptions about doors in the context of RPC (Remote Procedure Calls). Doors are not message passing-based RPC and do not have syscalls or mechanisms for threads to wait for requests in the callee. Instead, doors are a control transfer primitive that transfers the calling thread to the callee's address space, where it continues execution until a door_return syscall transfers it back to the caller's address space. Doors serve as a "door" into another address space and function similarly to CPU control transfer primitives like task gates or the system call instruction itself.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes a project from 1998 where the author and their colleague were tasked with building an efficient system for targeting advertisements to specific users on a website. They used Sun Enterprise machines running Solaris as their webservers and implemented a server process with an in-memory representation of active users. They utilized doors from a custom Apache module to query the user representation. Although the system was successful and fast, it was never used in production due to changing business priorities.

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges and frustrations of managing Type 1 diabetes and the desire for a more effective and personalized approach to treatment. The author shares their own experience with manually managing their blood glucose levels and the limitations of current methods. They express a desire for their healthcare provider to use models or simulations to optimize their treatment plan. The concept of an "artificial pancreas," which combines insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors, is mentioned as a potential solution, albeit not widely available yet. The author highlights the inspiring efforts of individuals who are hacking their own devices to create their own solutions. While they don't have access to a pump themselves, they express a desire to take a proactive approach in managing their diabetes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article highlights several things that cannot be taken for granted in the United States in 2024. These include: not assuming that medical professionals and insurance companies are acting in your best interest, doubting the knowledge of medical professionals, questioning the safety of substances that are legal to consume, being uncertain about the safety and measurement of pollutants in various environments, not being aware of potential health risks until they are litigated, potentially being unable to afford necessary treatment, and skepticism towards industries like healthcare, insurance, public health, and government in terms of protecting individuals. The author admits to being influenced by propaganda that painted a more positive image of the country in their youth. They express their lack of surprise at these issues and anticipate more of them in the future.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is prediabetic with a family history of type 2 diabetes. Their primary care doctor does not seem concerned about their condition. To delay the onset of type 2 diabetes, the author uses a glucose monitor every 2 hours to track their blood sugar levels. They have gathered data on which foods spike their blood sugar and which ones have a neutral effect. Surprisingly, foods often recommended for diabetics, such as beans and brown rice, cause a significant increase in their blood sugar, while other foods like bananas and nuts are fine. The author has also realized that they are the only one responsible for their health, as their doctors only care about their inflammatory markers.

## 5. [The Origin of Emacs in 1976](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41052593)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

The article includes excerpts of emails from the first couple of months of Emacs in 1976, providing historical insight into its creation. Guy Steele's records indicate that Richard M. Stallman (RMS) did the bulk of the development work, but had some implementation help from others and assistance with design and debugging. The article emphasizes that RMS deserves the majority of credit for turning a package of TECO macros into a powerful editor and for working with the early user community. Overall, the article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the development of EMACS.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the TECO version of EMACS and provides a link to the dired code. It suggests that humans do not require programming languages, assemblers, or compilers to program effectively.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the way email addresses were written in 1976 and questions whether they used the word "at" instead of the @ symbol. The author acknowledges that this was before the invention of DNS and is not surprised by the lack of TLD (Top-Level Domain).

## 6. [Pnut: A C to POSIX shell compiler you can trust](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41052446)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 Pnut is a tool that can transpile C programs into shell scripts, eliminating the need for shell scripting. This allows C programs to be highly portable and run on any system with a POSIX-compliant shell. Pnut allows developers to write scripts in plain C, without having to learn a new language. The output of Pnut is human-readable, making it easy to inspect, debug, and maintain code. It can run on any POSIX-compliant shell, including bash and zsh, on major operating systems like Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article talks about Pnut, a human-readable shell script that can be used as a reproducible build system. It mentions that Pnut is powerful enough to compile itself and TCC (Tiny C Compiler). Since TCC can bootstrap GCC, it is possible to build a fully featured build toolchain using only human-readable source files and a POSIX shell. Pnut also features a native code backend called pnut-exe, which supports a larger subset of C99. This compiler can be compiled using pnut.sh, enabling the compilation of pnut-exe.c and then TCC from a POSIX shell. The article does not provide a step-by-step demo of the process and it is unclear if the authors attempted to use NetBSD or OpenBSD, or another small C compiler like pcc. There is a mention that TCC had problems with NetBSD in the past, but it is unclear if those problems still persist based on its inclusion in NetBSD pkgsrc WIP.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of a specific software in handling C-only functions. It highlights runtime errors and invalid codes that occur when using certain functions. Additionally, it points out that the write() call does not handle errors and does not even return -1 on failures. The article questions the reliability of the software's compiler.

## 7. [Solving the out-of-context chunk problem for RAG](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41034297)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 error

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that the best approach is to begin with a traditional full text search (FTS) and ensure it is effective for manual human searches. Then, they recommend incorporating a RAG-style solution (a type of AI model with probabilistic outcomes) once the FTS is functioning well. The author believes that adding the AI model without a functioning FTS would not provide any value.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of adding contextual titles, summaries, keywords, and questions to the metadata of each chunk in RAG applications. This implementation is considered to require minimal effort while yielding high returns.
