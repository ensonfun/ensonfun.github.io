The code and model for Magika are available on GitHub under the Apache2 License. It can be installed via pip without needing a GPU.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a tool that was used to analyze web crawl data, which included various file types such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and fonts. The tool incorrectly identified some simple HTML files as "MS Visual Basic source (VBA)", "ASP source (code)", and "Generic text document", while the correct identification should have been "HTML document text" according to the `file` utility. Additionally, the tool incorrectly identified some woff and woff2 files as "Unknown binary data (unknown)" with low confidence guesses, while the correct identification should have been "Web Open Font Format" according to the `file` utility. The author of the article likes the idea of the tool but believes that the current implementation is unreliable, especially for automation. The author also mentions a minor issue with the tool's output not properly detecting shell color escapes when piped into another program like vim.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author reminisces about an experience they had almost 10 years ago when they were working on a Rails app. They were trying to detect the file type of uploaded spreadsheets, specifically noting that .xlsx files were being detected as application/zip, which was technically accurate but not helpful. They discovered a "magic" solution to detect the correct file type and submitted a patch, but it was rejected because it looked beyond the first 256 bytes of the file, which violated a hard limit. The author then comments that in 2024, this problem can be addressed using deep learning, and wonders if Google has released any speed performance benchmarks comparing the old-fashioned implementations to the new approach.
