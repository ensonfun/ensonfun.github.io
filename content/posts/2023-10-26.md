## 1. [The Cloud Computer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38023891)

**Total comment counts : 110**

### Summary

 Oxide has announced the general availability of the world's first commercial cloud computer, along with $44 million in Series A financing. The company has three core beliefs: cloud computing is the future of all computing infrastructure, the computer that runs the cloud should be purchased and not rented, and building a cloud computer requires a rack-level approach. While the first belief is widely accepted, the second belief is gaining more recognition as people realize the rental-only model for the cloud is not sustainable. The development of a cloud computer necessitates the co-design of hardware and software. Oxide's rack-level design allows for higher density and reduced latency. The company has created its own switch and networking software, providing an integrated experience for users. The Oxide cloud computer includes all system software built-in, with no additional licensing to manage or pay for. The software is also open source, ensuring transparency for users.

## 4. [The negative impact of mobile-first web design on desktop](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38025767)

**Total comment counts : 47**

### Summary

 The article discusses the usability issues that arise when mobile-first web designs are viewed on desktop devices. This design trend, known as content dispersion, causes the content to appear overly large, stretched out, and dispersed across long scrolling pages with excessive white space and enlarged images and fonts. The article reports on a study that involved qualitative usability tests and interviews, finding that content dispersion on large-screen devices leads to increased cognitive load and interaction costs, difficulty understanding content, and user frustration. The article also explains that content dispersion is a result of the combination of mobile-first, minimalist, and image-focused design trends. The use of these trends, which are popular due to the increasing importance of mobile devices, results in low information density, making it harder for users to find specific information and leading to fragmented content. The article recommends design solutions to avoid these usability pitfalls, such as utilizing a condensed layout for desktop pages and using minimalist designs that focus attention on key points.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of the "hinternet" coined by blogger Danny O'Brien in 2007. It explains that the hinternet refers to a split internet, with one part consisting of sophisticated technology and value-added services, and the other part being filled with spam and low-quality content. Originally, the hinternet was seen as a separate space that the technological elite would avoid, while normal people had no way to discern between the two. However, now most of the internet has become hinternet, as banking systems, mortgage platforms, and other services are designed primarily for mobile devices and employ dark techniques for user verification. The article concludes by stating that there are attempts to create more sophisticated online spaces, but there is a strong disincentive for individuals to participate in the hinternet beyond what is mandatory.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of frontend development, highlighting that it is often considered the most difficult part of the stack. The author emphasizes that simply creating a modern-looking application is not enough, as frontend engineers must have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS, and web APIs to build complex user interfaces that work across different browsers, devices, and languages, while also considering the needs of users with assistive technologies. The article concludes by stating that proficient frontend engineers are rare, and UX designers who also possess this knowledge are highly valuable in the industry.

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses the vulnerabilities and potential risks associated with OAuth (Open Authorization), a popular protocol used for user authentication and authorization in web services. It highlights the ease of implementing OAuth, but also warns about the complexity and potential security threats it poses. The article presents a case study of how OAuth vulnerabilities were exploited in well-known services like Vidio, Bukalapak, and Grammarly, leading to account takeovers and potential data breaches. The author emphasizes the importance of verifying access tokens and implementing secure OAuth implementations to prevent such vulnerabilities. The mentioned companies have since fixed the issues and responded promptly to resolve the vulnerabilities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author argues that OAuth, a common authentication protocol, has several issues. One issue is the assumption that the browser part of the flow is done by a real user, which can lead to storing and automating users' credentials. The author believes that OAuth is often unnecessary and adds unnecessary complexity and exploit vectors. They suggest using a revokable Bearer Token instead for most API use cases. However, they acknowledge that OAuth can be useful in user-first scenarios, but question its inclusion in server-to-server access.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits and challenges of using the OAuth protocol for web services. While the OAuth protocol is secure by design, integrating it into existing platforms can be problematic. The author mentions that the complexity of the protocol can lead to implementation errors and shortcuts taken in the wrong places. Additionally, there are intermediary components that can give the false sense of understanding the protocol, leading to potential misuse. Despite these challenges, the author acknowledges that using OAuth is still preferable to creating a new scheme, as long as users take the time to properly understand it.

## 8. [Exclusive hardwood may be illegally harvested](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38025998)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 A recent study from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden reveals that over three-quarters of the tropical wood type ipê from the top producing region in Brazil could have been harvested illegally. Ipê wood is highly sought after for building exclusive wooden decks in North America and Europe. The demand for this material has increased significantly in recent years, particularly in European, American, and Canadian markets. The study explores the risks of illegal logging in Brazil and identifies where in the supply chains the logging is likely to have taken place. The researchers found that 16 percent of ipê on the market is harvested without proper permits, and there is more wood in circulation than official production figures indicate. The study aims to raise awareness of the extent of illegal logging among decision-makers, supply chain actors, and consumers. It highlights the importance of knowing the origin and production chain of wood before purchasing and suggests that certification for sustainably produced wood, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, can help guide consumers in making responsible choices. The study's authors hope that their research will improve forest control systems and support supply chain actors in promoting responsible and sustainable timber sourcing.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Brazil's president in 2020 promised to disclose the countries involved in the consumption of illegally extracted wood from the Amazon. However, no further updates were provided on this matter. A startup had also proposed using DNA to certify the origin of the wood for traceability purposes. Efforts to curb the trade of illegal timber, such as the EU Timber Regulation and the US Lacey Act, would make harvesting these trees less profitable by reducing demand and thus impacting the activity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that as a consumer, it is important to question the origin of the wood in products and ask for documentation about its source and production process. However, the author believes that it is unlikely for sellers to disclose if the wood is illegally harvested. Salespeople may not be aware of or understand this concern, and even if they do, there may be little motivation for them to be transparent. Therefore, the author doubts how effective this approach is for consumers.

## 9. [Cold war satellite images reveal unknown Roman forts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38024665)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 Declassified cold-war spy satellite images have revealed 396 previously unknown Roman forts in Syria and Iraq, challenging previous understanding of the Roman empire's frontier. Aerial photographs taken in the 1960s and 70s show these newly discovered forts, leading researchers to question the purpose of the defensive line previously assumed to protect the empire from external threats. The findings suggest that the frontier was a dynamic area of trade and communication, with the forts facilitating caravan-based interregional trade. The discovery also indicates that the Roman world had less rigid borders and was more open to trade and communication with non-Roman territories than previously believed. The images, obtained from the world's first spy-satellite program during the cold war, highlight the importance of satellite imagery for recording archaeological features before they are lost to modern development. With more imagery being declassified, researchers anticipate making further archaeological discoveries in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the difficulty of placing certain sites in a larger world context, particularly in relation to the Tigris-Euphrates area and the Roman Empire. The author creates a graphic to help visualize the locations and notes that the farthest fortress of the Romans, Circesium, existed by 256 AD. However, the Roman Empire was in decline and undergoing a split into the West-East divide, as well as the formation of the breakaway Palmyrene Empire ruled by Zenobia. The author places all locations on a map of the Palmyrene Empire circa 271 AD, relative to well-known locations like Palmyra, Jerusalem, Petra, Cyprus, and more. The article provides various sources and links for further information and references.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses why a person might choose to use older, lower quality imagery rather than newer and higher quality versions. The reason is that the older images from the Cold War era offer a high-resolution, stereo perspective on a landscape that has been changed significantly by modern-day land-use.
