## 1. [Silicon Valley's best kept secret: Founder liquidity](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40654190)

**Total comment counts : 95**

### Summary

 The article discusses the disparity in equity and risk between founders and early employees in startup companies. It highlights the common narrative that founders take on greater risks and therefore receive larger equity stakes. However, the article introduces the concept of founder liquidity, where founders sell a portion of their shares during funding rounds to secure personal financial stability. This practice is often kept secret and not offered to employees, which undermines the perception of founders being "all-in" and taking on more risk. The article provides examples of founder liquidity, including the case of Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork, who was able to cash out billions while employees received nothing. The article argues that what feels unfair is not the founders getting liquidity, but the fact that only they have access to it.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses three interesting aspects related to the topic of early liquidity for founders: 
1. The opportunity cost of taking early liquidity: Cashing out a portion of their position early may provide personal financial security for founders, but if the startup eventually sells for a much larger amount, the decision to sell early may be regretted.
2. Meaningful vs. not-meaningful amounts: The article questions whether allowing all employees to sell a similar percentage of their positions, like the founder, would be significant enough to make a difference in their lives.
3. The need for buyers: The founder chooses their buyer and future business partner by deciding to sell shares, potentially giving the buyer more control over the company. However, the article questions the benefit to buyers in purchasing employees' shares, as it may not provide enough incentive for the employees and could potentially de-motivate them.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the rarity of secondary sales at the Series A stage and the reasons why early employees are often not included in such transactions. It mentions that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 14e-2 sets certain regulatory requirements and disclosures when more than 10 sellers are involved. The article also includes a personal anecdote about someone leaving a successful startup to become a founder and their expectations of stress and risk. The writer sarcastically comments on the lack of stress reported by the individual after four months.

## 6. [AES-GCM and breaking it on nonce reuse](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40653125)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 This article discusses the security vulnerabilities of the AES-GCM mode of operation when a nonce (number used once) is reused. The article explains AES-GCM, which is widely used in symmetric encryption, and how it can be compromised when a nonce is reused. It goes into detail about the encryption and decryption process of AES and the importance of using unique nonces. The article also mentions the different key sizes for AES and the possibility of encrypting multiple blocks of data using a single key. It emphasizes the need for modes of operation, specifically focusing on the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), which provides authenticated encryption. Overall, the article highlights the risks associated with nonce reuse in AES-GCM and the importance of ensuring unique nonces for secure communication.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that if an attacker has access to both the plaintext and ciphertext, they can compute the keystream used in encryption. Additionally, if the attacker only has access to two ciphertexts and the nonce (a random number for encryption) is reused, it is possible to determine the corresponding plaintext. This is because when two plaintexts are XORed together, they can be easily decoded.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of not reusing an XOR key sequence for stream cipher encryption. It mentions that with RC4, this meant that the same key could never be used. However, with modern stream ciphers, there is the nonce for this, and the CTR mode of a block cipher acts as a stream cipher. GCM mode is mentioned as an extension of CTR mode for authentication. The article also includes a link to an online demo tutorial on cipher encryption.

## 9. [How to get the most out of Postgres memory settings](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40642803)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses how to manage the memory usage of the Postgres database in order to optimize performance. It explains that the largest segment of RAM associated with Postgres is called shared buffers, which store frequently accessed rows from tables and indexes. The size of shared buffers should be properly sized to avoid over-allocation of memory. The default recommendation for shared_buffers is to use 25% of available RAM. The article also mentions the use of the pg_buffercache extension to determine the amount of RAM used by active tables and indexes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the belief that PostgreSQL (pg) connections consume a significant amount of memory is mostly a misconception. While there is a common estimate of 10-20MB per connection, the author argues that it is closer to 2MB per connection. The article provides a link for further details.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article advises that in order to optimize the existing RAM, it is important to avoid making poor indexing choices. It suggests that not every column needs an index, and specifically mentions that indexing a UUIDv4 column should be avoided. Additionally, the article recommends periodically reindexing to reclaim RAM, as indices can shrink significantly and improve performance. Reclaiming enough RAM can result in having the entire working set cached, leading to faster speed at no cost.
