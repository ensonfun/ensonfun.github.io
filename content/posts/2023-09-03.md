 The author expresses concerns about the proposed timeline in the article, stating that it is not plausible. They argue that while Windows 10 S has been largely unsuccessful, the ideas presented are not fully implemented, such as Web Environment Integrity in Chrome. The author suggests that including other Apple-related changes, such as Apple blocking unsigned apps by default on Mac and the rollout of System Integrity Protection, would strengthen the argument. They conclude that although they are not against these changes individually, they are part of the pattern the author is highlighting. The author recommends focusing on presenting accurate facts to make the article more impactful.

## 2. [Hacking the Timex m851](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37368099)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article is written by Tavis Ormandy, who is on a quest to find the perfect watch. He introduces the Timex m851 watch, which he believes is the best ultra-low power consumer digital watch ever produced. The watch uses an 8-bit Seiko SC188 CPU and has 48KB of ROM, 2KB of RAM, and a 42x11 dot matrix main display. It can last 3 years on a single battery. The watch has an SDK and a USB port for synchronization. The author praises the SDK and shares a "hello world" code example. The author explains that applications for the watch need to be split into states because of limited RAM. The watch supports modes, background tasks, and periodic tasks. The watch has various features and APIs provided by the kernel, including timers, generating tones, scrolling the display, and accessing database records. The author also mentions a simulator available for Windows that helps in development. The article concludes by mentioning that the Timex m851 watch is no longer in production and is difficult to find.

## 4. [Transformers as Support Vector Machines](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37367951)

### Summary

 The user does not currently have permission to access the specified link on arXiv.org. If they believe this is a mistake, they can refer to the provided link for more information on how to regain access.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the transformer model is a different type of support vector machine (SVM) that separates "good" tokens from "bad" tokens within input sequences. This SVM acts as a good-token-selector and differs from traditional SVMs that assign a 0-1 label to inputs. The article also discusses how attention induces sparsity through softmax. "Bad" tokens that fall on the wrong side of the SVM decision boundary are suppressed by the softmax function, while "good" tokens have non-zero probabilities. The exponential nature of the softmax gives rise to this SVM. The title of the paper does not clearly indicate this information.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article wonders if a single Support Vector Machine (SVM) layer can be as effective as the multiple steps in a transformer layer. They speculate that while it may not reduce computations significantly, it could lead to a simpler and easier-to-implement architecture.

## 5. [UPI Payments: 10B transactions a month done, next stop 100B](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37367855)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article discusses the growing popularity of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India. UPI, a payment system that allows users to make instant transfers between bank accounts, has recently surpassed 10 billion monthly transactions for the first time. The value of these transactions exceeds Rs 15 trillion per month. Experts predict that UPI transactions could reach 20 billion per month within the next 18-24 months. UPI's use-cases have expanded beyond peer-to-peer and merchant transactions to include payments for initial public offerings and UPI credit. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is also working on expanding UPI's international presence. Currently, the majority of UPI transactions are carried out through mobile applications like PhonePe and Google Pay, which account for 80-90% of all UPI transactions. However, efforts are being made to encourage more payment applications and banks to adopt UPI and support merchant acquisition. Policy decisions are needed to lower entry barriers for new payments businesses and make UPI payments viable for larger merchants. Despite its success, there are concerns about the dominance of a few key players in the UPI market. The NPCI is exploring ways to expand the merchant acceptance space and prevent monopolies.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author has been using UPI (Unified Payments Interface) since its early days in India, but is now cautious and trying to limit its use to known people or established institutions. They express a wish for an additional layer of tokenization in UPI transactions to obfuscate phone numbers and UPI IDs. The author shares an experience of receiving unsolicited phone calls from people they paid via UPI, trying to sell or scam them. They also mention a scam involving random females calling on WhatsApp Video and threatening to make explicit screenshots viral to extort money. The author expresses discomfort with giving out personal information at tea stalls and random shops.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the difficulty faced by a foreigner in accessing India's UPI system, preventing them from using cashless fast food outlets and booking intercity bus tickets. The author managed to get a bus ticket by persuading someone to use their personal UPI account in exchange for cash. The article suggests that as more communities go cashless globally, similar problems might arise for travelers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In 2004, the author purchased the domain names Ubuntu.it and later Kubuntu.it to host their blog about Linux and Ubuntu. They decided to donate both domains to the Italian Ubuntu community when they were approached by its members. The author requested a small phrase, "kindly donated by Ubuntista," to be displayed on the website, which was initially implemented but later removed. Despite their disappointment, the author still supports Ubuntu and has advocated for it for several years.

 The author had come up with the name "PayDemon" and already purchased related domain names. They found that the word "Stripe" was free of any existing brand associations and had positive connotations. However, they had to decide if a good name was worth the cost, while they had already spent money to register the PayDemon domains. Additionally, the author mentioned that paydaemon.com could be a suitable domain for a directory of BSD operating system projects in need of funding.
