## 2. [Crows are even smarter than we thought](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41405195)

**Total comment counts : 57**

### Summary

 New evidence suggests that crows belonging to the corvid family have surprising mental abilities. In a recent study, researchers from Lomonosov Moscow State University and the University of Bristol found that a species of crow called the hooded crow can memorize the shape and size of an object and reproduce it later, even after the object has been taken away. This ability, known as forming "mental templates," was previously thought to be unique to humans. Mental templates allow animals to create tools, learn from other members of their species, and pass along improvements in tool making over time. The researchers found that young crows learn how to make tools by stealing their parents' tools and reproducing them. The ability to create and use mental templates may be more widespread among bird species and possibly across the animal kingdom as a whole.

**Total comment counts : 2**

### Summary

 BaseX is a versatile XML database and XQuery processor that can handle large amounts of textual and binary resources. It supports various file formats such as XML, HTML, JSON, and CSV. It comes with a user-friendly GUI that includes an IDE for writing complex applications and visualizations for data exploration. BaseX is platform-independent and licensed under BSD. Additionally, it supports web application development with RESTXQ and complies with W3C's Update and Full-Text extensions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of using BaseX, a software tool developed by a single developer over many years. The author praises BaseX for its ability to generate well-formed XML output, which eliminates the possibility of nesting errors caused by typos. They also highlight the simplicity of reasoning about code in BaseX, as variables are immutable in its functional language, XQuery. However, the author suggests that an area for improvement in BaseX is the implementation of type checking. While XQuery allows for defining types via XML Schema, there is currently no mature open source implementation that can check the types on each function. BaseX does support ad-hoc validation by calling a validation function explicitly.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author used a tool in the past to convert XML into JSON data. The tool also has the ability to render JSON. The author finds the tool to be flexible and user-friendly, although it has some unconventional aspects.

## 10. [Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41405243)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article discusses the problem of drawing a circle with a given radius using a programming language. The author explores different solutions, ultimately arriving at Bresenham's algorithm. The article includes code examples in Rust and Python, and also explains the concept of a circle and its coordinates. The author also mentions the use of symmetry to simplify the problem and discusses a brute force approach for solving it.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the calculation of distances from a circle using a function F(x, y). If F(x, y) = 0, then the point (x, y) is exactly on the circle. If F(x, y) > 0, the point is outside the circle, and if F(x, y) < 0, the point is inside it. However, the article points out that the exact distance from the circle, G(x, y), is not just the square root of F(x, y) and does not behave monotonically with respect to F(x, y). Despite this, Bresenham's algorithm is still exact and always chooses the next point based on which is truly closest to the circle, even though it uses an approximation error function.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that Bresenham's family of algorithms, which were widely used in computer graphics, were developed during a time when computers could only execute one instruction per cycle without pipelining or prediction. Nowadays, processors prefer to draw shapes by first selecting tiles of interest and then evaluating each pixel in each tile independently. This approach aims to maximize pipelined parallelism and reduce unnecessary work.
