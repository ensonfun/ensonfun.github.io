## 1. [Behind the 6-digit code: Building HOTP and TOTP from scratch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43653322)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concepts of One-Time Passwords (OTPs) used in modern authentication systems, focusing on HOTP and TOTP algorithms. OTPs enhance security by generating a code that is valid only for a single use or for a limited time, mitigating risks associated with replay attacks. The server and user must share a secret key, which can be dynamically altered using time, as in TOTP. The article explains the synchronization of this process and the importance of using cryptographically secure algorithms to generate OTPs, ultimately leading to safer authentication methods.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Six-digit verification codes used in "forgot password" flows are one-time passwords (OTPs), distinct from HOTP/TOTP which involve a registration step with a server-generated secret. The TOTP method can be enhanced using public key cryptography, akin to how security keys work. This approach could prevent phishing by limiting which apps can request security keys, leading to a concept similar to WebAuthn. It's also important to implement protections against code guessing attacks on these six-digit schemes, despite their large number of possibilities. The article appreciates the exploration of HMAC internals and security functions.
