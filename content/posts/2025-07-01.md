## 1. [The new skill in AI is not prompting, it's context engineering](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44427757)

**Total comment counts : 113**

### Summary

 Context Engineering is an emerging concept in AI, shifting the focus from "prompt engineering" to a broader framework that emphasizes the quality of information provided to language models (LLMs). Tobi Lutke defines it as the art of supplying the necessary context for LLMs to solve tasks effectively. Success in AI agents increasingly depends not just on code complexity, but on the quality of context supplied, as agent failures often stem from inadequate context. Thus, Context Engineering involves designing dynamic systems that present the right information and tools in the appropriate format at the right time for effective task execution.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Building effective AI agents relies more on contextual engineering and delivering the right information and tools at the appropriate time, rather than merely finding optimal prompts or model updates. However, the ambiguity in defining "right" information and timing raises questions about whether this approach differs significantly from traditional prompt engineering. Given the non-deterministic nature of AI, it seems challenging to establish reliable heuristics, making the process resemble trial-and-error often seen with prompts.
