### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses the limitations of different models when summarizing various types of documents. They mention that while their own approach works well, it does not scale to all document types. For scientific papers, another model called meta's nougat is more suitable due to its ability to accurately render formulas. Similarly, for invoices and records, a model called donut performs better. However, both of these models have their own shortcomings, so the author suggests running LLM (Language Model) to address any issues. Despite this, LLM is unable to effectively handle tables and charts, as the details are often lost during the optical character recognition (OCR) process. The author then goes on to express their preference for vision models, which have the advantage of having the original document or image. Clear prompts can help improve results, but no vision model currently provides fine-tuning for images, except for Google Gemini, which the author has not yet tried. Finally, the author recommends using prompt injection and providing a few shots to keep the LLM from generating inaccurate summaries and to adhere to the requested format.
