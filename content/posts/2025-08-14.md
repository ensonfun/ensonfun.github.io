### Summary

 NGINX has introduced a preview release of ACME support through the new ngx_http_acme_module, enabling users to manage SSL/TLS certificates directly within NGINX configurations. This enhancement simplifies the certificate management process by reducing manual errors and reliance on external tools like Certbot. Currently, the implementation supports HTTP-01 challenges, with plans for future challenge types. The ACME protocol automates certificate management processes, driving wider HTTPS adoption and adapting to modern web infrastructures. Users can access pre-built packages for both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus customers to utilize this new feature.

 The current implementation supports HTTP-01 challenges for verifying domain ownership, but there is a strong desire for DNS-01 support, especially for users of nginx not exposed publicly, like those using Nginx Proxy Manager. DNS-01 is preferred as it involves simply updating records without being directly linked to hosted content.

The author’s advocacy stems from early interactions with OCaml in a supportive community and continued exploration in academic settings.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 A Google talk on Rust in the Android team highlighted two key points: many projects were migrated from Python, suggesting performance wasn't a primary concern, and the most appreciated features were basic ones like pattern matching and algebraic data types (ADTs). The speaker concluded that the advantages of Rust reflect benefits seen in ML around 1990, implying that if OCaml had evolved around 2010 to address issues like multicore support, it could have filled the role Rust now occupies. OCaml struggled between academic viability and industry demand.
