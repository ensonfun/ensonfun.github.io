**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article details Ubicloud's experience with Hetzner's AX162 server line, which was introduced as an upgrade over the AX161 but turned out to be significantly less reliable. Here are the key points:

1. **Initial Attraction**: Ubicloud was initially excited about the AX162 due to its better performance and lower cost.

2. **Reliability Issues**: Shortly after deployment, these servers began crashing frequently, with the first crash occurring just three weeks after purchase. The crashes were initially unexplained, with NULL bytes in system logs suggesting abrupt system failures.

3. **Investigation and Hypotheses**: Ubicloud conducted extensive tests to identify the cause:
   - They considered high CPU load as a potential issue but found crashes occurred even at low loads.
   - Temperature was monitored, but no significant correlation with crashes was found.
   - Hardware components were compared between failing and non-failing servers, finding no significant differences.

4. **Power Limitation Hypothesis**: Ubicloud hypothesized that Hetzner might be limiting power usage to fit more machines into their data centers, potentially causing hardware degradation. This was supported by power consumption measurements.

5. **Data Analysis**: Using the Annualized Failure Rate (AFR), Ubicloud determined that AX162 servers were 16 times more likely to crash than other models. They also noted a pattern where servers that crashed once were very likely to crash again soon.

6. **Resolution**: After months of troubleshooting and interaction with Hetzner, it was discovered that a batch of motherboards was defective. Hetzner replaced these with a new batch, which resolved the issue for the most part.

7. **Outcome**: Ubicloud managed to replace the faulty hardware with minimal disruption as they had already shifted critical workloads off the AX162 servers. However, they remained cautious about fully returning to using these servers for critical operations.

The article highlights the complexities of hardware reliability in data centers and the importance of thorough investigation and collaboration with hardware providers to resolve such issues.

## 2. [Multiple Russia-aligned threat actors actively targeting Signal Messenger](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43102284)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has noted an uptick in efforts by Russian state-aligned actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts, particularly those used by individuals of interest to Russian intelligence, driven by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. These actors exploit Signal's "linked devices" feature by using malicious QR codes that link a victim's account to an actor-controlled instance, allowing real-time eavesdropping without needing full device access. Tactics include:

- **Remote Phishing**: Malicious QR codes are disguised as legitimate Signal resources like group invites or security alerts.
- **Close-Access Operations**: Actors like APT44 use captured devices on the battlefield to link Signal accounts to their infrastructure.
- **Phishing Campaigns**: Groups like UNC5792 modify Signal group invites to redirect users to malicious URLs that link their Signal accounts to actor-controlled devices.

These methods are not only used against Signal but also other messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. GTIG warns of the potential expansion of these tactics to other regions and actors. Signal has responded by enhancing security features in its latest updates to combat these phishing attempts. The article emphasizes the need for awareness and updates to protect against such espionage efforts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges and limitations of achieving true end-to-end (E2E) encryption in digital communication services, particularly focusing on the vulnerabilities introduced by the necessity of client-side software:

1. **Client-side Security**: The author points out that even with robust encryption protocols, security can be undermined if the client software (like a chat app) includes malicious code or trackers. This could easily leak data despite the encryption on the transmission level.

2. **Verification and Trust**: The article emphasizes that for E2E encryption to be truly effective, users must be able to verify and build the client software themselves. However, practical issues like distribution through app stores (e.g., iOS) can introduce risks where the software might be tampered with during the publishing process.

3. **Complexity in Multi-party Systems**: In scenarios involving multiple users (like group chats), ensuring all parties are using secure, verified clients adds another layer of complexity and potential vulnerability.

4. **False Security**: The author expresses concern that using well-known encrypted services like Signal might actually make users more of a target for surveillance under the assumption that they are secure, which could be a false sense of security.

5. **Discussion Focus**: There's a critique on how security discussions often focus on the theoretical aspects of encryption protocols rather than the practicalities of implementation and potential client-side exploits.

The author concludes with a sense of skepticism about the effectiveness of E2E encryption outside of encrypted storage, suggesting that much of the effort might be undermined by simpler, overlooked vectors for data leakage.

## 6. [Broken legs and ankles heal better if you walk on them within weeks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43101383)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 The article discusses a significant shift in the treatment of broken legs and ankles, moving away from the traditional advice of prolonged immobilization. Here are the key points:

1. **Change in Medical Advice**: Traditionally, patients were advised to avoid weight-bearing on broken legs for at least six weeks. However, recent studies suggest that early weight-bearing (within weeks) does not increase complications and might even benefit healing.

2. **Benefits of Early Weight-Bearing**: 
   - Helps in faster healing of bones.
   - Improves quality of life by allowing patients to return to normal activities sooner.
   - Prevents muscle atrophy and bone density loss, which can occur with prolonged immobilization.

3. **Scientific Backing**: 
   - The principle of bone adaptation to load, known as Wolff's Law, supports the idea that bones need stress to heal properly. 
   - Research indicates that early mobility can lead to better outcomes, especially in terms of bone and muscle health.

4. **Surgical Advances**: 
   - Modern surgical techniques like reduction and fixation (using screws, plates, or rods) stabilize the bone, allowing for early weight-bearing as the bone heals naturally.

5. **Implications for Specific Groups**: 
   - For older patients with hip fractures, early mobility is crucial to avoid severe complications like blood clots, lung weakening, and high mortality rates. Recent studies show that early weight-bearing post-hip surgery can decrease mortality.

6. **Cultural Shift in Medicine**: 
   - There has been a cultural shift from overly cautious treatment to evidence-based practices, recognizing that early mobility can be advantageous for many patients.

The article concludes that while the process of bone healing is consistent across the body, the complications and implications differ, particularly with weight-bearing bones like those in the lower limbs, prompting a reevaluation of standard care practices.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article reflects on the author's personal experiences with various injuries and health issues, particularly focusing on changes in medical advice regarding recovery. Initially, the approach was to rest and avoid any strain on the injured parts. However, the advice has shifted towards moderate activity rather than complete rest, even when recovering from ailments. The author questions the efficacy of traditional rest when ill, suggesting that light activity like walking could be beneficial instead of staying completely bedridden.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experiences with breaking their collarbones while mountain biking. Initially, there was a debate among doctors about whether to operate on the first broken collarbone, resulting in a 'wait and see' approach, which ultimately did not require surgery and healed well. The author contrasts this experience with their first collarbone fracture, where recovery was slow and involved significant arm atrophy due to lack of proper guidance. However, with the second fracture, with better medical and rehabilitation guidance, the recovery was much quicker with minimal atrophy, allowing the use of the arm within a month.

## 7. [Kafka at the low end: how bad can it get?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43095070)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of using Apache Kafka as a job queue in web applications, particularly focusing on the issue of job distribution fairness among workers:

1. **Problem Description**: Kafka, when used as a job queue, can lead to an unfair distribution of work where some workers might be overloaded while others remain idle due to the way Kafka partitions messages.

2. **Example Scenario**: If you have a Kafka topic with 16 partitions and currently only 4 consumers, with 5 producers (like web application servers), the worst-case scenario could result in one consumer processing all jobs while others are idle. This happens because of how jobs are assigned based on partitions and the round-robin routing of API calls.

3. **Formula for Unfairness**: The article provides a formula `(partitions / consumers) * producers` to estimate how many jobs might go to one worker before others get any work. In the example given, this results in potentially 20 jobs going to one consumer.

4. **Impact**: This unfair job distribution can significantly impact job completion times, especially in low volume or when job run times vary greatly, leading to dissatisfaction among users if the jobs are not evenly distributed.

5. **When It Matters**: The author suggests that for peak periods, if the number of jobs exceeds `WorstCaseJobsPerConsumer * Consumers`, all workers are likely to be engaged. Below this threshold, the system might not use its resources efficiently.

6. **Conclusion**: Kafka is not designed for job queues with low volume or where fairness in job distribution is crucial. Its design suits high-volume data streams, not the typical needs of a job queue in web applications. The author looks forward to future updates like Queues for Kafka (KIP-932) which might mitigate some of these issues. 

In summary, while Kafka excels in handling vast quantities of data, its use as a job queue can lead to inefficient worker utilization due to its inherent design for different use cases.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that using Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, for handling small volumes of messages is often seen as an over-engineered solution, primarily aimed at enhancing a resume rather than being a practical choice for the task at hand.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The Kafka protocol functions as a distributed write-ahead log, which is a basic, low-level system. To utilize it as a job queue, one would need to develop additional layers or applications on top of this protocol.

## 8. [Implementing LLaMA3 in 100 Lines of Pure Jax](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43097932)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses implementing the Llama3 model from scratch using JAX, a library known for its functional programming aesthetics and capabilities like XLA for acceleration, JIT compilation, and parallel computing. Here are the key points:

1. **Why JAX?**: JAX is chosen for its functional programming paradigm, which ensures code predictability and ease of parallelization. Unlike PyTorch, JAX uses pure functions that always produce the same output for a given input without side effects.

2. **Model Setup**: The process begins by setting up the computational device and configuring hyperparameters for training a model with approximately 2 million parameters.

3. **Weight Initialization**: Since JAX does not use classes for parameter tracking, weights are initialized and updated manually. Randomness is managed through explicit PRNG keys for reproducibility and parallelism.

4. **Model Architecture**: 
   - **Attention Module**: Contains four trainable parameters.
   - **Feed-forward Network**: Includes three trainable parameters.
   - **Transformer Block**: Combines weights from attention and feed-forward layers, plus RMSNorm for two layers.
   - **Weights Management**: Weights are managed as key-value pairs in dictionaries.

5. **Tokenization**: Uses Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) with the `tiktoken` library for tokenizing text into tokens, which are then embedded into a continuous vector space for neural network processing.

6. **Embeddings**: Dynamic embeddings are used to capture context and overcome the limitations of static embeddings like semantic ambiguity.

7. **Normalization**: RMS normalization is used to stabilize training by maintaining a balance in the network's numerical values.

8. **Positional Encoding**: Introduces ROPE (Rotary Position Embedding) to encode positional information into the model, allowing it to understand the order of tokens through rotation of query and key vectors.

The article emphasizes JAX's unique features for model training, the manual handling of weights, and specific techniques like BPE for tokenization and ROPE for positional encoding, all tailored to create an efficient and scalable model implementation.
