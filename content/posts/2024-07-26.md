## 1. [Bayesian Statistics: The three cultures](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41080373)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article suggests that Bayesians can be categorized based on two criteria: whether they incorporate their knowledge or beliefs about the world into their priors, and whether they iterate on the model based on its goodness-of-fit and usefulness. The author labels the resulting combinations as informative/pragmatic, uninformative/objective, and subjective. However, the author disagrees with the model and believes that most Bayesians in industry fall into the category of iterating on the model and using uninformative or weakly informative priors. The author finds it surprising that the "no iteration" category even exists, as iterating on the model seems necessary.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their dissatisfaction with being categorized into specific clubs or sides within the scientific community. They identify themselves as information-theoretic in orientation, possibly leaning towards objective Bayesianism. They question the idea of dividing culture into three categories (objective, subjective, pragmatic), arguing that the "pragmatic" culture does not exclude subjective or objective Bayesianism. They suggest that the approach to prior specification and interpretation should be formalized rather than treated as smoke and mirrors. The author also raises concerns about how Bayesianism is viewed skeptically, as the process of "choosing a prior" followed by "seeing how well everything fits" and then "repeating" resembles model tweaking or p-hacking. They believe that the issues with Bayesian inference lie in how it is used and abused in practice, rather than in the theory itself.

## 2. [Show HN: Haystack – an IDE for exploring and editing code on an infinite canvas](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41068719)

**Total comment counts : 81**

### Summary

 The article addresses various frequently asked questions regarding the Haystack code search tool. Some of the questions include whether it is possible to retain settings from Visual Studio Code, whether Haystack logs or sends code anywhere, how to navigate more efficiently within editors, how to display missing extensions in the sidebar, what languages are supported by Haystack, why the Python language server may not work, and which platforms are supported by Haystack.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is expressing their excitement about the concept of working with code on a canvas and having a flowchart user interface. They mention that they mainly work with data processing and draw flowcharts for communicating pipelines. They believe that having a development user interface that aligns with this concept would be helpful for managing complex codebases written by non-computer science professionals.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 I apologize, but I am unable to access or summarize the content of that URL. Could you please provide me with the text or a brief description of the article so I can assist you better?

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The city of Cracow in Poland implemented a strict ban on billboards and other visual advertising two years ago. The ban has resulted in positive outcomes. However, some companies have found loopholes, such as using renovation works covers to display up to 50% of advertising. The author expresses frustration at the visual garbage in cities without such bans and believes that such advertising should be banned everywhere.

## 5. [Applied Machine Learning for Tabular Data](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41072616)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article is about a work in progress to create a practical guide for developing quality predictive models from tabular data. The authors welcome community contributions and aim to make the materials reusable and open. The guide takes a holistic view of the predictive modeling process, including feature engineering and post-modeling activities. The authors avoid using the term "artificial intelligence" and emphasize the importance of statistical understanding. The intended audience includes data analysts, and some background in modeling and statistics is necessary. The authors recommend other books for a more theoretical treatment of machine learning models. The authors also mention that they will provide computing supplements and exercise sections to accompany the materials. Overall, the goal of the guide is to help readers build intuition about the predictive modeling process and address various questions and challenges.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with tabular data textbooks and how they typically introduce various techniques without providing guidance for real-world problems. The author suggests a four-step approach for tackling tabular data problems, including ensuring the absence of invalid or leaked data, intelligent data splitting, starting with a simple regression model for establishing a baseline, and using more advanced models like GAM or XGBoost depending on the need for interpretability or state-of-the-art results.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article recommends using XGBoost as a popular model for machine learning. It also suggests using scikit-learn's LogisticRegressionCV if a linear model is preferred. The main challenge is accurately assessing the performance of the model on unseen data. Cross-validation is proposed as a solution, with two different applications: determining hyperparameters and assessing generalization performance. Nested cross-validation is recommended as a robust method for implementing these approaches. Selecting the "production" model with nested cross-validation can be complex and reading additional resources is suggested. The article provides a link to a paper discussing the need for two loops of cross-validation.

## 7. [Launch HN: Undermind (YC S24) – AI agent for discovering scientific papers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41069909)

**Total comment counts : 59**

### Summary

 The article discusses the frustrations of physicists during their graduate studies as they struggled to find research materials efficiently. They often had to spend hours manually searching through papers on Google Scholar, which led them to skip thorough research and potentially miss important information. To address this issue, the physicists developed a search system that mimics human research strategies. The system involves engaging with a language model to understand complex research goals and then conducting a tailored search for approximately three minutes. The system follows citation trails and adapts its search strategy to find relevant content. The aim is to provide accurate and specific results while ensuring exhaustive discovery. The article also provides a link to try the search system and encourages users to provide feedback on their experience.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author, a computer science academic, tried out a tool mentioned on Hacker News to see if it could find anything in the literature that they had missed. The tool successfully identified two relevant items from the author's own community, which they had previously overlooked. Despite some irrelevant results and information the author was already aware of, they were impressed with the tool overall and plan to use it again in the future.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses positive feedback about a product they recently tried and states that they are likely to sign up for it. They suggest that if the product can also perform patent searches in multiple languages, it would be even more valuable. The author explains that patent searches conducted by attorneys often cost thousands of dollars and can still be flawed. They share a personal experience of having a patent denied due to a mention of something similar in a different invention's description. The author concludes by stating that they would be willing to pay $100/month for a product called "Deep Patent Search" and potentially even more if it proves to be highly effective.
