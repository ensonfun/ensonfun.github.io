## 1. [Fly.io Postgres cluster down for 3 days, no word from them about it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36808296)

**Total comment counts : 60**

### Summary

 The article is a compilation of comments and experiences from users who have been facing issues with the Fly app. They report problems with health checks, machines being in a stopped state, inability to restart or destroy instances, and errors when trying to redeploy the app. Some users have managed to restore availability to their app by scaling and allocating more virtual machines (VMs), but the bad VMs remain in an indeterminate state. Users also express frustration with the lack of information and updates from Fly support, and concerns about the impact of these issues on their production apps and data. Some have managed to work around the problems by creating new instances or clusters, but overall, users express a loss of trust in the platform due to these recurring issues.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a response from Fly regarding a support thread. The thread was initially missed by the company, but was flagged internally and addressed later. The thread was related to a host issue in the syd region, where a host went down and required manual intervention to recover. Apps with multiple instances were able to remain operational, while single instance apps on the affected host experienced an outage. The company acknowledges the need to improve communication during such incidents and apologizes for any inconvenience caused.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights several important points regarding communication issues with a certain provider. Despite staff working on the issue before customers noticed, the response time from paid support was slow. It took approximately 20 hours for the provider to provide an update on the downed host and they failed to update affected users or provide recovery solutions. The provider's status page did not accurately reflect the ongoing emergency maintenance. The article suggests that this level of poor communication may result in the loss of customers and advises the provider to adopt a more proactive approach like other providers who promptly notify customers of any issues.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on their experience with the Java programming language and their involvement in a project to develop an operating system (OS) in Java back in 1992. The goal was to create a minimal set of "machine code" (native methods) that would reduce the vulnerability of an embedded OS. Although they were using C instead of Rust for the native methods, they acknowledge that using the Rust JVM would enhance memory safety throughout the development process.

## 4. [Study finds billions of nanoplastics released when microwaving containers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36809565)

**Total comment counts : 41**

### Summary

 New research from the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln reveals that microwaving plastic baby food containers can release significant quantities of plastic particles. The study found that some containers released over 2 billion nanoplastics and 4 million microplastics per square centimeter. The health effects of consuming these particles are still unclear, but the study showed that three-quarters of cultured embryonic kidney cells died after exposure. The World Health Organization has recommended limiting exposure to micro- and nanoplastics. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the extent of plastic particle ingestion and calls for the development of plastic containers that release fewer or no micro- and nanoplastics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The researchers exposed cells to particle concentrations that infants and toddlers might accumulate over days or from multiple sources. After two days, only 23% of kidney cells exposed to the highest concentrations survived. The author finds it concerning but questions the relevance of the study's results to real-world outcomes, as toddlers do not seem to experience kidney problems from consuming similar amounts of microplastics.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author admits to being skeptical about claims regarding replacing plastic containers and dishware but has started to replace them with stainless steel and glass. They believe drinks taste better in glass and steel is a non-fragile option. Additionally, the author cooks with cast iron as a way to avoid plastic. They acknowledge it's difficult to completely avoid plastic but see the switch as replacing fragile disposable items with sturdier alternatives.

## 5. [Nanosecond timestamp collisions are common](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36810818)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The author conducted a test to determine how often nanosecond timestamps collide on modern systems. They found that collisions occur very frequently, with approximately 5% of all samples showing collisions when reading the clock on all 4 physical cores simultaneously. The author suggests that it is unsafe to assume that a raw nanosecond timestamp is a unique identifier. The behavior of timestamp collisions varies between different systems, with Linux showing increasing absolute and monotonic times within a single thread, while Mac OS X has a high number of collisions due to microsecond resolution.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article recommends using IDs that combine a time component and a sequence for various reasons. For example, UUIDv7 combines a milliseconds time component, a field that increments for each event in the same millisecond, and random bits to minimize the chance of collisions between IDs generated on different machines. Although there are limitations, such as the possibility of overflowing the sequence and the potential for collisions between machines, UUIDv7 is considered effective for large-scale event generation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how thread scheduling can impact observations of events on multi-core systems. The author, a former program manager of the security event log in Windows, explains that thread quantum expiration and delays in time stamping can cause out of order event log entries and imprecise log timestamp accuracy.

## 6. [Quench of LHC inner triplet magnet causes a small leak with major consequences](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36811018)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article describes an incident at CERN where the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) had to be shut down due to an electrical perturbation that caused several superconducting magnets to lose their superconducting state. This resulted in the need for repair and the potential for a delay in the LHC's operation. Investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the problem and develop a repair strategy.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author describes the difficulty of dealing with helium leaks in a self-built dilution cryostat during their PhD. To find the leaks, the cryostat had to be pumped to high vacuum and helium was sprayed onto different parts of the system. The helium would be sucked in through the leak and detected by a mass spectrometer, producing a sound whose pitch increased with the measured helium density. Once a leak was found, the entire system had to be vented, the faulty seal removed, and a new one replaced. Some leaks would only appear at extremely cold temperatures, requiring guesswork and the replacement of multiple seals in the area until the right one was found. Deepening the temperature would cause helium to become suprafluid, making it even more prone to leak and necessitating the redoing of all seals.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an incident at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) where a cooling section called sector S78 needed attention. The author expresses relief that the incident did not cause any major consequences or explosions. They also highlight the detailed report released just two days after the incident, praising CERN's technical diagnostic teams.

## 7. [Ability to see expertise is a milestone worth aiming for (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36784864)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses the idea that experts have a greater understanding and perception of their domain than novices do. This creates an inconvenience for novices because they struggle to grasp the nuances of expertise and cannot easily learn from experts. The article also explores how this discrepancy in expertise can result in skilled professionals charging lower rates than their less-skilled counterparts due to a lack of differentiation by customers. The author suggests that reaching a "vocab point," where a person can understand and engage in nuanced discussions with experts, can be a milestone in acquiring expertise. The article provides examples from sports and music to illustrate this concept. It concludes by emphasizing the importance of internalizing knowledge and feelings in a skill domain to truly grasp expertise.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the idea that expertise in a profession can often be measured by the ability to achieve higher and more challenging goals. It states that there comes a point where improvements in skills become so subtle that only another expert can appreciate the difference between proficiency levels. The article uses examples such as a tennis player improving their scores, a software engineer writing more efficient code, and a writer gaining more views or sales as indicators of expertise. It emphasizes that expertise is necessary for success and cannot be replaced by luck.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article provides updates from the author, including their temporary relocation to another city where they spent four months training Judo for five hours every day and have reached the vocabulary point for the sport. The author also mentions that this experiment was covered in previous articles. However, the details of the experiment and the content of the previous articles are not included in the summary.

## 8. [Dementia risk linked to blood-protein imbalance in middle age](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36813564)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 A study published in Science Translational Medicine has identified proteins that are linked to the development of dementia if their levels are unbalanced in middle age. The study followed thousands of participants over 25 years and found 32 proteins that were strongly associated with an elevated risk of developing dementia later in life if dysregulated between the ages of 45 and 60. These proteins have functions outside of the brain, and their involvement in dementia is likely not due to chance alone. The study suggests that analyzing a person's proteome could potentially strengthen existing predictors of dementia risk. The proteins identified in the study are involved in processes related to proteostasis and the immune system, highlighting their potential roles in dementia. Further research is needed to understand how these proteins fit into the physiology of dementia and how they can be used for early interventions and personalized treatments.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses individual differences in neuronal and glial cell metabolism and excretion, which can lead to toxic effects and inflammation. The author also mentions being funded to study blood proteomics and long-term cognitive outcomes after a large vessel stroke, with a specific focus on early identification of post-stroke dementia.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a protein called GDF15, which is strongly associated with an increased risk of dementia. Researchers have identified a total of 32 proteins that, if unbalanced in middle age, could lead to a higher risk of developing dementia. However, the article does not provide specific steps on how to influence the levels of these proteins. The research seems to focus more on identifying potential biomarkers for early detection and risk assessment of dementia rather than outlining therapeutic interventions. GDF15 is a stress-responsive cytokine that plays a role in various physiological and pathological processes. Most of the research into influencing GDF15 levels has been in the context of pharmaceutical interventions for conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.

Primo is built with Svelte components, making it highly flexible. It offers secure, scalable, and fast-loading websites without the need for additional plugins. Collaboration is made easy, with the option to invite multiple developers or content editors to work on pages together. Users can start with one of Primo's free themes and quickly customize it using CSS variables. Primo also provides a library of pre-built blocks that automatically adapt to the site's design. It is MIT licensed and actively developed, with plans to become a nonprofit organization. Any funds generated will be used to support further development, similar to Ghost CMS. Primo is compatible with SvelteKit, NextJS, and other frameworks. Additionally, Primo offers features like design fields for predefined style options and cloud functions for backend code writing.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article explains that drag-and-drop content management systems (CMSes) may appear impressive and easy to use in demonstrations, but they often become problematic in practice. The constant need for updates and requests for customization from content creators make the system difficult to effectively use, resulting in unsatisfactory results. The author suggests that a better approach would be a headless CMS, where content is provided and professional developers match it to the designs. However, the author acknowledges that not everyone has the resources for this and recognizes the value of drag-and-drop CMSes, despite the potential issues they can cause.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article is sharing links to various discussions and resources related to the Github repository for Primo CMS. The links include previous discussions on Hacker News as well as a Show HN post with additional text from what appears to be the original poster's alternative account.

## 10. [In the LLM space, "open source" is being used to mean "downloadable weights"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36815255)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The author discusses the evolution of the term "open source" and its application in the world of AI models. They mention the tension between commercial interests and the curiosity of hackers in the software industry. The article highlights the bifurcation between the "free software" and "open source" communities, and the recent tension between commercial open source companies and cloud hyperscalers. The author also discusses the concept of "open weights" in AI models and the debate over whether a model can be considered open source without providing all the necessary training code and data. Despite the varying definitions and levels of openness, the author emphasizes the importance of openness in the AI community and the positive impact of initiatives like the LLaMA2 license.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that using the term "open source" for certain weights in the LLM world is misleading and cheapens the meaning of open source. While the author understands the perspective of referring to unrestricted weights as open source, they disagree and believe it is more accurate to call them "open weights" instead. The article criticizes Facebook for labeling LLaMA as open source when it is actually a closed, proprietary set of weights. The author also briefly mentions the copyrightability of weights as another topic of discussion.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article did not know that the llama license prohibits the use of its outputs to train other models. This restriction is seen as a dealbreaker because synthetic data is expected to become increasingly crucial for training models. The author believes that any model that restricts the use of synthetic data for training other models is severely limited.
