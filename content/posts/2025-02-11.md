## 1. [Undergraduate shows that searches within hash tables can be much faster](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43002511)

**Total comment counts : 53**

### Summary

 The article discusses a significant advancement in computer science, centered around hash tables, a common data structure for storing data. Andrew Krapivin, then an undergraduate at Rutgers University, was inspired by a paper titled "Tiny Pointers" which dealt with minimizing the memory used by pointers in data storage. His exploration led him to develop a new type of hash table that performs faster than traditional ones, disproving a 40-year-old conjecture in the process. This new hash table, detailed in a January 2025 paper co-authored with his former professor Martín Farach-Colton and William Kuszmaul, allows for quicker data retrieval and insertion even when the hash table is nearly full, challenging established theories about the efficiency limits of hash table operations. The discovery has been noted for its importance due to the ubiquity and fundamental role of hash tables in computing.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how breakthroughs and innovative creations, like Krapivin's work on Yao's conjecture and the game "Balatro," often come from individuals who are not influenced by prior knowledge or conventions in their fields. The author suggests that ignorance or disregard of existing solutions can lead to novel ideas and approaches. However, they express concern that the interconnected nature of the modern world, facilitated by the internet, tends to homogenize thinking, reducing the likelihood of such unique, uninhibited creativity. This homogenization is viewed negatively as it potentially stifles innovation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a hashing technique named "funnel hashing," which was highlighted in a video shared by someone named monort. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Concept**: Funnel hashing involves dividing an array into exponentially smaller sub-arrays (A0, A1, etc.) where the size of each subsequent array decreases by a factor of m (e.g., |A0| = n/m, |A1| = n/m^2).

2. **Insertion Process**: The insertion process starts at the largest array (A0) and attempts to insert an element c times. If unsuccessful, it moves to the next smaller array (A1), and continues this process down the "funnel" until a free slot is found.

3. **Parameters**: The fraction of empty slots in the hash table, denoted by δ, might be either a static parameter set during hash table creation or dynamically updated. The number of insertion attempts, c, and the number of levels, k, are set to achieve a worst-case complexity of O(log^2(1/δ)).

4. **Non-Greedy Approach**: Unlike traditional methods which might use a greedy approach, funnel hashing is non-greedy as it cascades through different levels of arrays, potentially avoiding some of the pitfalls described by Yao's result on greedy insertion and search policies.

5. **Comparison**: The author mentions that this technique reminds them of another concept known as "Distinct Elements in Streams" by Chakraborty, Vinodchandran, and Meel, suggesting some thematic or methodological similarities.

6. **Details and Open Questions**: The author acknowledges that there might be many small details to work out in the application of funnel hashing, indicating the technique's complexity and areas for further exploration or clarification.

The article provides links to the original discussion, the video explaining funnel hashing, and a related research paper, encouraging further reading and discussion on the topic.

Overall, the article combines personal narrative with product critique, humor, and a touch of scientific curiosity, while also poking fun at the absurdity of licking car parts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how liquid capsaicin treatments can be used to repel squirrels from bird feeders. Capsaicin, the compound that makes chili peppers spicy, affects mammals but not birds because:

- **Birds lack receptors for capsaicin** and thus do not feel the heat, allowing them to eat seeds and distribute them undigested, which benefits plant reproduction.
- **Mammals, including squirrels, have receptors for capsaicin**, which acts as a deterrent due to its spicy sensation. Mammals chew seeds, often destroying them, which is detrimental to seed dispersal.

The author has personally used a capsaicin-based product to keep squirrels away from bird feeders, directing them instead to a separate feeding station designed for squirrels, thereby illustrating an effective application of evolutionary biology in managing wildlife interactions at home.

## 3. [Firing programmers for AI is a mistake](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43010814)

**Total comment counts : 134**

### Summary

 The article critiques the tech industry's growing reliance on AI to replace human programmers, highlighting several negative consequences:

1. **Loss of Practical Skills**: The article argues that the traditional training of programmers, which involves real-world problem-solving and learning from experienced engineers, is being neglected as companies lean on AI to generate code. This could lead to a future generation of programmers who lack deep understanding and problem-solving skills.

2. **AI Limitations**: AI tools can generate code but cannot handle complex debugging, optimization, or real-world system resilience. The author uses the analogy of teaching kids to drive only on autopilot, suggesting that when AI fails, these programmers won't know how to manually intervene.

3. **Corporate Missteps**: Companies that fire their programmers in favor of AI might face severe issues like security breaches or system failures, as illustrated by the hypothetical scenario of a fintech company. These companies will struggle to find experienced programmers to fix AI-induced problems, especially since many might have moved on or started their own ventures.

4. **Market Shift**: Experienced programmers who understand systems at a deep level will become more valuable. They will either be in high demand, charging high rates, or have moved into niche areas or started their own companies, making them less available for traditional corporate roles.

5. **Industry-Wide Impact**: The overall ecosystem of innovation could suffer as the industry might lose the nuanced human touch in programming, potentially leading to a decline in software quality and innovation.

The article concludes that by sidelining human programmers for AI, the tech industry risks undermining its own future, creating a dependency on technology without the expertise to manage it when it inevitably fails or requires human intervention.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights a significant gap between public perception of AI capabilities and the practical experiences of developers. Developers recognize AI's limitations, particularly in significantly altering or enhancing mature codebases. The author expresses skepticism about the potential of current AI technologies, specifically Language Model Learning (LLM), to revolutionize software development soon. However, AI is acknowledged to be quite effective for smaller, routine coding tasks such as completing small code segments, explaining code, or making minor modifications.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes two main assumptions presented in another article about AI in coding:

1. **AI's coding capabilities will remain static**: The author argues that AI coding tools will not stay the same; they will evolve and improve significantly in quality and functionality over time.

2. **Mass replacement of human developers with AI**: Instead of sudden mass layoffs, the author believes companies will gradually reduce hiring new developers as AI enhances the productivity of existing staff, without completely replacing human coders.

The critique suggests that the original article indulges in "doomerism," portraying AI as a threat that diminishes the artistic aspect of programming. However, the author reassures that programmers can still choose to code manually if they prefer the traditional methods, indicating that AI is more of an enhancement tool rather than a complete replacement.

## 4. [Fun with C++26 reflection: Keyword Arguments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43006536)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The blog post discusses implementing order-independent keyword arguments in C++ using proposed reflection features from C++26. Here are the key points:

1. **Background**: Named or keyword arguments have been suggested multiple times for C++ but were not adopted, leading to creative workarounds.

2. **Current Methods**: 
   - C++20's designated initializers allow for a form of keyword argument syntax, but with limitations like the need for curly braces and prefixes.
   - A more advanced approach involves defining wrapper types with overloaded `operator=` to simulate keyword arguments. This method, however, requires repetitive setup for each argument.

3. **Proposed Reflection Technique**: 
   - Using reflection, the author suggests creating a named tuple where arguments can be accessed by name, thus allowing for order-independent keyword arguments.
   - Functions can be constrained to require certain keyword arguments, making the use of these arguments more robust.
   - Optional arguments can be handled using checks or default values provided through reflection capabilities.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - The process involves creating a class type with named members for each argument, which can then be accessed or checked for existence using reflection.
   - Macros or user-defined literals can simplify the syntax at the call site, although some verbosity remains.

5. **Examples and Testing**: 
   - The author provides GitHub links to an example implementation and encourages testing with Bloomberg’s experimental P2996 clang fork.
   - Code snippets and compiler explorer links are included to demonstrate how these techniques work in practice.

The post concludes that while the syntax might not be as clean as in languages with native support for keyword arguments, the proposed reflection features offer a powerful workaround, significantly enhancing the expressiveness and flexibility of function calls in C++.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses frustration and confusion about why some programmers, particularly those using C++, are fascinated with overly complex or bespoke programming techniques when simpler, more practical solutions exist. The author criticizes the use of such methods for seemingly unnecessary reasons like handling hypothetical scenarios (e.g., measuring in a "4th dimension") and argues that these practices are not only impractical but also likely to cause issues due to their complexity (leaky abstractions). The author questions why these complexities aren't handled at a more fundamental, language level, suggesting that such an approach would be more sensible.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of a parameter struct (`FooArgs`) to pass multiple arguments to functions, which adds readability at the cost of slightly more verbose code. Here are the key points:

1. **Readability vs. Verbosity**: Using a separate struct for function parameters makes the code more readable, even though it requires more lines of code. This approach is recommended for functions with numerous parameters where the extra lines are a minor overhead.

2. **Initialization Concerns**: There's a discussion on whether fields in `FooArgs` are automatically initialized to default values if not explicitly set. The author suggests using default member initializers in the struct definition for clarity and reliability.

3. **Type Safety with Templates**: The article mentions using a string template parameter in `TypedArg` to prevent argument mix-ups, ensuring that parameters are called with their correct names, enhancing type safety and reducing errors in argument assignment. 

Overall, while the method described adds some boilerplate code, it significantly improves the clarity and maintainability of the code, particularly for complex functions.

## 8. [Nvidia's RTX 5090 power connectors are melting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43008879)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 **Summary:**

Two owners of Nvidia’s new RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPUs have reported issues with the 12VHPWR power connectors melting, causing damage to their GPUs and power supplies. These incidents echo similar problems seen with the RTX 4090 two years prior. Despite initial blame on user error for not fully inserting the connectors, further investigation by tech experts suggests that the issue might be related to a current distribution problem within the RTX 5090 model. The PCI-SIG has since introduced an updated connector, the 12V-2x6, designed to improve reliability, although Nvidia still allows the use of existing 12VHPWR cables. Manufacturers like Corsair and MSI have added visual aids to ensure proper connection. AMD has opted out of using the 12VHPWR for its upcoming GPUs, criticizing it as a potential fire hazard. Nvidia has not commented on these recent incidents.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the safety concerns associated with the 12VHPWR (12V2x6) connector used in high-power applications, particularly in computing hardware:

- **Low Safety Margin**: The 12VHPWR connector has a very small safety margin. At 600W, the current per pin is close to the maximum capacity of the Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 connectors, which are typically rated to handle up to 8.5A.

- **Risk of Overload**: A minor issue like a bad connection or an imbalance in current distribution can lead to significant problems. If a single pin has a poor connection, the current can exceed the safe limits, potentially reaching 10A, which is well over the connector's specifications.

- **Thermal Issues**: Overloading can cause rapid heating, potentially melting the solder if pins are not fully mated, posing a risk of fire or hardware damage.

- **Wire Gauge Concerns**: The article mentions that the commonly used 16 gauge wire is already pushing its limits at 12V/8.5A/100W, suggesting that a thicker, 14 gauge wire would provide a better safety margin.

- **Conclusion**: The 12V2x6 connector needs to be handled with care due to its minimal safety margin to prevent damage to hardware.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article details a user's experience with repurposing old high-performance GPUs, specifically a K80 and M40, purchased cheaply from eBay. The user warns against using the K80 due to problematic drivers despite its attractive price for 24GB of VRAM. These GPUs were installed in an HP workstation with a 1200-watt power supply. Since the GPUs lacked their own cooling systems, the user created a custom cooling solution by 3D printing brackets to mount several Noctua fans, which run at full speed continuously. This setup effectively kept the GPU temperatures below 60 degrees Celsius and also cooled the CPUs, keeping them in the mid-20s at idle. The total cost for the workstation, GPUs, and fans was approximately $780. The user also mentions a struggle with designing the 3D printed brackets, particularly for the intake fans, which required multiple attempts to get right.

Despite the preference for the Mac Mini, the author still appreciated the detailed write-up of the alternative setup.

## 10. [Boring tech is mature, not old](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43012862)

**Total comment counts : 45**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of "boring" technology within the context of system administration and architecture. The author, Ruben Schade, explains why he considers "boring" tech, like NetBSD, to be a high form of praise. Here are the key points:

1. **Predictability is Key**: Boring technology behaves predictably, which is crucial for sysadmins who prefer not to be surprised, especially during urgent situations like middle-of-the-night alerts.

2. **Community and Documentation**: Boring tech typically has extensive documentation and a knowledgeable community, reducing the likelihood of encountering undocumented issues or edge cases.

3. **System Interactions**: Technology doesn't operate in isolation; its reliability is also dependent on how it interacts with other systems, which can compound potential issues if components are not mature or well-understood.

4. **Innovation vs. Reliability**: While innovation is necessary, the author argues that for operational stability, opting for well-understood, reliable technology often leads to better outcomes than adopting new, untested technologies.

5. **Counterpoints**: The article also explores counterarguments, noting that ubiquity or age alone doesn't make technology "boring" or reliable. For instance, Oracle databases are complex and not considered boring despite their age. 

6. **Maturity Over Age**: The distinction is made between age and maturity. Mature technology includes not just the software but also its surrounding ecosystem (community, documentation, track record), which contributes to its "boringness."

7. **Personal Anecdotes**: The author shares personal experiences and those of others who have seen significant improvements by replacing complex systems (like Kubernetes clusters) with simpler, more mature solutions, highlighting the practical benefits of choosing "boring" tech.

In summary, the article champions the use of mature, predictable technology in IT systems for the sake of reliability and ease of maintenance, arguing against the allure of new, flashy tech solutions that might not be as dependable.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the benefits of using "boring" technology for the backend and infrastructure of a SaaS app. The author, who works solo, prefers to use stable, reliable, and less trendy technologies for behind-the-scenes operations like databases and backend frameworks. This choice allows them to dedicate more time to developing new features and enhancing the product itself, rather than dealing with the complexities or updates of cutting-edge tech tools. The underlying point is that customers are more concerned with the functionality and features of the app than with the technical details of how it's built.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues against using the term "boring" to dismiss alternative software choices in favor of one's own preference. The author suggests that labeling a choice as "boring" implies it's the obvious, mature decision, unfairly simplifying the complex trade-offs involved in software selection. They emphasize that both options usually have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages, and that using "boring" as an argument can be as dismissive and condescending as other authoritarian or brand-name justifications for decision-making. The author calls for a more nuanced discussion of software choices rather than relying on superficial labels.
