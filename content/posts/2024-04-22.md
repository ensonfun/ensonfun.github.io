**Total comment counts : 138**

### Summary

 The article is inaccessible and cannot be summarized because the server encountered an error.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the changes in cartridge technology in gaming consoles, noting that older systems like the GameBoy Advance allowed cartridges to directly connect to the Bus and perform various functions. However, this practice ended after the Nintendo DS, and cartridges since then have been solely used for data storage. The author also mentions modern enhancements like Raytracing chips and the MSU1 enhancement chip, which is only available in software emulators but could be theoretically manufactured. Additionally, the author points out an error in the article's list of ROMs, clarifying the correct naming for a particular game. The article also includes links to videos debunking a myth about the cause of delay in gameplay rounds.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the performance differences in Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) cartridges. It points out that even carts without enhancement chips had varying levels of performance. The SNES CPU had a nominal speed of 3.58mhz, but it would only achieve this speed with a "FastROM" cart. Nintendo also offered a "SlowROM" cart format, which was cheaper but downclocked the CPU to 2.68mhz. Modders have been working on patches to convert SlowROM games into FastROM games to eliminate slowdown. Some SlowROM games were reportedly developed with FastROM in mind but were changed to SlowROM due to cost concerns from the publisher.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article compares Meta's licensing of its software to hardware vendors with Apple's licensing of the Mac OS in the 1990s. However, there is a key difference between the two situations. Apple primarily made money from the margins on Mac hardware, which clone vendors could undercut. In contrast, Meta sells its Quest hardware at breakeven or as a loss leader, so there is no significant threat to the Quest's existence. It is unsure if the hardware licensees can offer anything significant.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Meta's announcement regarding the introduction of their open mixed reality ecosystem. The move is seen as a response to complaints about Meta's closed platforms while criticizing others for the same. However, the ecosystem is not open source, and it is unclear why other OEMs would want to compete with Meta's hardware. The article also mentions that Meta plans to open up their store to offer more options for users, including experiences from Steam, Xbox Cloud Gaming, App Lab, and possibly even Google Play. However, it is unclear if Steam would be able to sell native Quest apps, and Google does not seem interested in allowing their Play Store app on the headset. The article later refers to another blog post that provides more details, suggesting that being "open" to Steam might only mean allowing game streaming, while being "open" to Google Play might mean allowing the installation of the Play Store app for 2D apps only. However, it seems that alternative app stores selling native 3D apps directly on the headset itself would not be allowed.

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of cookies to improve website experience and track user behavior. It then transitions to discussing the success of Interceptor 006 in capturing large amounts of trash in Guatemala's Rio Las Vacas. The article highlights the river's contribution to plastic emissions into the Gulf of Honduras and the Caribbean Sea. The Interceptor Barricade, consisting of strategically placed floating booms, is effective in capturing plastic waste during heavy rains. The article also mentions the global impact of The Ocean Cleanup's Interceptors and its mission to rid the oceans of plastic.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the commendable efforts of The Ocean Cleanup in reducing plastic pollution in the ocean. However, it mentions that this operation addresses only a very small fraction of the 8-10 million tons of plastic entering the ocean each year. The article suggests that a significant portion of ocean trash, estimated at 75%, comes from fishing boats, particularly Chinese fishing vessels. The author proposes that NGO's should focus on lobbying politicians and the UN to require fishing vessels to bring back their trash for proper processing. Furthermore, they mention that 10 rivers are responsible for the majority of ocean plastic, and if recovery systems are implemented in those areas, it would be a substantial step towards solving the problem.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The organization mentioned in the article has shifted its focus from removing plastic from the open ocean to intercepting it at river mouths, as it seems to be a more practical and cost-effective approach.

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 This article discusses a new world map that provides a detailed and accurate representation of Earth. The map is presented as two flat disks, with the Northern hemisphere on the left and the Southern hemisphere on the right. By clicking on a specific point on either hemisphere, the map can be adjusted to focus on that location. The map also includes options for spinning and pausing the rotation, as well as resetting the view. The article provides links to a higher-resolution version of the map, a rectangular projection, and a printable PDF file. It also references additional articles in The New York Times and Scientific American that discuss the map's accuracy and features.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that the Gott-Goldberg-Vanderbei projection has lower error, but its usefulness is significantly reduced. The author's favorite projection for world maps is Winkel Tripel. They state that Winkel Tripel used to be the standard until Google Maps popularized the use of Mercator for data visualization and political maps.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The Dymaxion Map, created by Fuller, is suggested as an example of a discontinuous map that still maintains continuity between continents. This map minimizes distortions while representing the world.

## 7. [NASA's Voyager 1 Resumes Sending Engineering Updates to Earth](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40117599)

**Total comment counts : 137**

### Summary

 NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft is finally able to return usable data about its onboard systems after not transmitting readable data since November. The issue was found to be tied to a chip responsible for storing a portion of the spacecraft's memory. The team was unable to repair the chip, so they devised a plan to divide and relocate the affected code in different sections of the memory. The first modification was successful, allowing the team to check the spacecraft's health and status. The team will continue to relocate and adjust the other affected portions of the software to enable the return of science data. Voyager 2, its twin spacecraft, is still operating normally.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The linked Wikipedia article provides information about the Voyager program's computers and data processing. The computers used in the Voyager program were built on a custom architecture with a 16/18-bit design and had a memory capacity of around 4k/8k words (approximately 9/18KB in total). Other sources suggest that these computers had a clock frequency of 250kHz and a processing speed of around 8KIPS.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their admiration for Voyager's ongoing journey and expresses a desire for future generations to continue monitoring its progress. They acknowledge that the data collected by Voyager may not have practical use in the future, but suggest that it would be interesting to have a tool that allows people to compare Voyager's path with the locations humans have colonized in the year 3000.
