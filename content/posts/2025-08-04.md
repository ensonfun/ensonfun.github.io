### Summary

 For remote teams of 2-10 people, creating personal "ramblings" channels in chat apps fosters social cohesion. Each team member has their channel for sharing thoughts without cluttering group discussions, functioning like personal journals. Team members post updates 1-3 times a week, with channels muted by default. This practice, adopted by Obsidian, facilitates informal communication, allowing ideas to flourish without the pressure of scheduled meetings. Ramblings keep connections alive between annual in-person meetups, often leading to innovative solutions and creative discussions.
