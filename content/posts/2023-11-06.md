 The article is about a graphical user interface (GUI) that is built on top of an existing technology called nrsc5-dui. The GUI is available on GitHub and allows users to interact with nrsc5-dui in a more user-friendly way.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses their hobby project of recording an FM radio music station using a SDR (software-defined radio) and then removing the non-music portions for offline listening. They compare three methods of recording: analog capture from a standalone FM receiver, recording the "HD" radio stream using the nrsc5 library, and using an AirSpy SDR with the airspy-fmradion library. They find that the "HD" radio stream had no hiss or multipath effects but had noticeable digital compression artifacts. The airspy-fmradion library produced the best audio quality. The author also mentions using the inaSpeechSegmenter library to identify speech vs. music segments in the recordings.

## 4. [The first stable release of a memory safe sudo implementation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38161016)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Prossimo has released the first stable version of sudo-rs, a Rust rewrite of the sudo utility. sudo allows engineers to transition between user and administrative accounts in the Linux operating system, and its security is crucial. The sudo-rs project enhances security by using Rust, a memory-safe language, and focuses on commonly used features to reduce the attack surface. The project also includes an extensive test suite that revealed bugs in the original sudo. The Wolfi Linux OS already incorporates sudo-rs, and there are hopes that others will follow suit. The development of sudo-rs has progressed well since its initiation in December 2022, and a security audit is scheduled for September 2023. Prossimo acknowledges Todd C. Miller for maintaining the original C-based sudo and providing guidance for implementing sudo-rs. Funding for the audit of sudo-rs has been provided by the NLnet Foundation, and support from Amazon Web Services has helped with the transition to memory-safe software. Prossimo thanks its funders and encourages others to get involved, donate, or become sponsors for their work.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses the long history and continuous development of the "sudo" command, a widely-used UNIX command known for its high level of security scrutiny. The author questions the possibility of a development team being able to completely reimplement the command without inadvertently introducing bugs. They also inquire about the role of the Rust programming language in mitigating the risk of introducing bugs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes two overlooked aspects of a project: excluding less commonly used features to reduce the attack surface and developing a thorough test suite that can even identify bugs in the original software. These aspects are crucial in writing safety-critical code, even more so than rewriting the code in Rust.

## 10. [Drunk grizzlies keep getting hit by trains in Montana](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38155324)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 Since 1980, 63 grizzly bears have been killed by trains along a section of railroad near Glacier National Park in Montana. The bears are attracted to fermented grain spilled from railcars, which can render them unable to outrun oncoming trains. The worst year for fatalities was 2019, with eight grizzlies killed, and three have been killed so far this year. The grain ferments and acts as a tempting treat for the bears. Experts suggest implementing measures such as noise makers triggered by trains approaching known dangerous areas or reducing the train's cargo load, but little has been done to protect the bears thus far.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes a situation in which the presence of apple trees in a parking lot led to a problem. The apples would ferment and this caused squirrels to become intoxicated. As a result, the drunk squirrels would chase people around, resulting in amusing but potentially unpleasant situations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the lack of strict littering and secure load laws in Montana compared to other states. It mentions that while other states have criminal laws and regulations regarding littering and securing loads on vehicles, Montana does not seem to have similar rules for trains and certain types of trucks. The article suggests that introducing littering and secure load laws that apply in other states could help address this issue. Additionally, it mentions the possibility of environmental protection laws being applicable in this context.
