## 7. [FBI improperly used 702 surveillance powers on US senator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36822654)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The FBI has been found to have improperly used surveillance powers to conduct searches on a U.S. senator, state lawmaker, and state judge, according to court records released as part of a public records request. These searches were conducted under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows for warrantless spying on foreigners located abroad. Critics argue that this tool is often used as a backdoor method to gather information on Americans. The court opinion highlighted three instances where FBI personnel conducted searches on sensitive query terms related to U.S. public officials without seeking approval. The FBI and Justice Department have noted recent reforms to address these issues, but lawmakers are calling for significant reforms before reauthorizing Section 702, which is set to expire at the end of the year.

Edgar Hoover (former FBI director) were limited compared to the present digital era.

## 8. [ElKaWe – Electrocaloric heat pumps](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36823524)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The ElKaWe lighthouse project, led by the Fraunhofer IPM, involves six Fraunhofer Institutes working on the development of electrocaloric heat pumps for heating and cooling. These heat pumps offer higher efficiency and do not require harmful refrigerants. Scientists are developing ceramic and polymer-based electrocaloric materials and innovative system approaches to enable efficient heat dissipation. The project aims to demonstrate that electrocaloric heat pumps can replace compressors in the long term. Heat pumps are important for the transition to renewable energy, but the adoption of compressor-based heat pumps is slow due to poor economic efficiency. The gradual ban on refrigerants under European regulations also makes refrigerant-free technologies more desirable in cooling technology. Electrocaloric materials, when subjected to an electric field, show a heating effect, which can then be dissipated via a heat sink, resulting in cooling. The process can be reversed, allowing for efficient heating or cooling, functioning as a heat pump.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a lecture on a technology involving perovskite crystals that can generate temperature differentials when an electric field is applied. The process involves heating up the crystals with the field, cooling them down naturally, and then rapidly cooling them when the field is removed. The temperature differential can be harnessed by placing the device between a hot side and a cold side, similar to a container with fluid. The fluid flow pushes the heat to one side, causing the device to heat up, and then pushes it to the other side, cooling the device. The article also mentions the use of a "slapper" device that taps the device to a load when it is cool and another load when it is hot. The technology is compared to other methods like vapor compression and acoustic, and while it is more efficient than vapor compression, it is less efficient than acoustic. The practicality and economic feasibility of this technology compared to others, such as thermo acoustic heat pumps, are still questions that need to be addressed.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the topic of banning f-gases in the European Union (EU) and the implications of this decision. The author suggests that the EU's ban on f-gases led to the establishment of a program of subsidies to search for alternatives. This created a transition market where foreign industries, such as those in China, Japan, and the US, could benefit from EU investments and subsidies. The author also mentions their agreement with the existence of institutions like Fraunhofer and acknowledges the uncertainty of the success of fundamental innovations like these.
