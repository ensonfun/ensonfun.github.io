### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of coordination in distributed systems. It presents the CALM theorem, which states that a program has a consistent, coordination-free distributed implementation if and only if it is monotonic. Monotonic programs are those in which running them on a subset of inputs yields a subset of outputs. The article explains that understanding which programs are monotonic allows for the design of scalable and efficient distributed systems. It also mentions conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), which provide a framework for writing monotonic programs. CRDTs are widely used in distributed systems because they enable coordination-free implementation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the CALM property and its relationship to database systems and Lamport's CStructs in Generalized Consensus. It suggests that while set-based operations in databases satisfy the CALM property, they may not be expressive enough for all computations. However, it raises the question of whether all computations can be decomposed into a partial order of CALM programs that only require coordination at specific points, similar to Lamport's CStructs.

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses a combo in the card game Magic: The Gathering involving the cards Omniscience and Petals of Insight. The combo allows players to manipulate the order of cards in their library. However, due to the game's rules, players must be able to provide an exact number of iterations in the combo. The article explains how to calculate the number of iterations needed to sort the library, and the procedure for sorting all the cards. The algorithm provided may not be the most efficient, but it meets the requirements for declaring and executing loops in the game.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that a certain action should not be considered a loop based on the criteria set in the 4.4 Loops rule. The action involves changing the order of cards in a specific way, and the blog mentioned in the article seems to disregard this criterion. The article also highlights a problem that arises when players are allowed to interrupt a loop after a certain number of iterations, questioning what the deck would look like after a significant number of steps.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that failing to provide proofs and apply them goes against the rules.
