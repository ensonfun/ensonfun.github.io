### Summary

 This article discusses the development of Google's first Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) and its architecture. The objective of the project was to create an ASIC that would provide a 10x cost-performance advantage over GPUs for inference. The TPU is designed to speed up operations involving tensors, which are multilinear relationships between different objects. The hardware is focused on performing calculations associated with one and two-dimensional arrays, specifically vector and matrix operations. The TPU's architecture follows a systolic approach, originally proposed in a 1978 paper, where processors rhythmically compute and pass data through the system. This approach efficiently performs matrix multiplications by using a grid of multiplication units. The article provides a step-by-step example of how matrix multiplication is performed using the TPU's systolic architecture.

 The article discusses an interview with Groq CEO Jonathon Ross, who talks about the creation of the original TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) at Google. Initially, it started as a FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) in Ross's 20% time, in response to a team facing inference speed issues. They were able to make it work, and then Jeff Dean, a Google executive, decided to switch to an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) after doing some calculations. The article suggests that the TPU team should be spun off as a separate company from Google since it is seen as the only credible competition to NVidia, and its software support is second only to NVidia.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that home inkjet printers are most useful for those who regularly print a lot of photos and require high image quality. However, if you don't print frequently, the ink nozzles can become clogged, wasting ink in the process. In this case, a laser printer is recommended as it can print documents even after being unused for a long time. If occasional photo printing is needed, using professional printing services is more advantageous than dealing with clogged ink cartridges. For those who print a lot of documents, a laser printer is faster and more cost-effective since ink tends to be more expensive per page than toner. Therefore, the main reason to get an inkjet printer is if high-quality color prints, specifically photos, are frequently needed.

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Sega Saturn console and its hardware features. It mentions that Sega chose the Hitachi SuperH or 'SH' CPU, which has a new instruction set called SuperH ISA. The article explains that the size of the instructions is compressed to reduce program size and improve performance. However, there are still some drawbacks, such as control hazards and the small 16-bit multiplier. Therefore, Hitachi released a second revision called SH-2 with an extended multiplier unit. The article also mentions that the Sega Saturn has two SH-2 CPUs running at around 28.63 MHz each, placed in a master-slave state. It explains the use of cache and the division of 2 MB of RAM between two blocks. Additionally, the console has an additional coprocessor called the Saturn Control Unit (SCU) for vector processing.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes the Sega Saturn's design as surprising due to its lack of synergy between the Japan and USA teams. The Japanese team was working on a 2D console, while the US team was working on a 3D console. However, the arrival of the PlayStation caused them to merge the two designs, resulting in a 2D console with unfinished 3D components. This design choice was praised by tech enthusiasts but criticized by those seeking a clean design. The lack of focus from Sega also contributed to disappointment among gamers of that era.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the VDP1 used in the Sega Saturn console is designed to use quadrilaterals as primitives, limiting it to composing models using 4-vertex polygons. This led to Sega Saturn games having a more boxy appearance compared to PlayStation 1 games. The article suggests comparing Resident Evil on both consoles to see the difference. Overall, Sega Saturn games have a unique aesthetic in 90s 3D gaming. Additionally, the article mentions that the Sega Saturn's emulation lags behind other platforms, possibly due to its lack of success in the west and its complex architecture.

## 6. [Moirai: A time series foundation model for universal forecasting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39823104)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses a new time series forecasting model called Moirai. It highlights the model's versatility in addressing diverse forecasting tasks across different domains, frequencies, and variables. Moirai solves four major challenges: constructing a large-scale and diverse time series dataset, using multiple patch size projection layers to capture temporal patterns, implementing an any-variate attention mechanism to handle forecasts across any variable, and integrating a mixture distribution for flexible predictive distributions. The model is evaluated and shown to outperform other models in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. The article also discusses the importance of efficiently managing resources in IT infrastructure and the potential of universal forecasting, where a single large pre-trained model handles any time series forecasting problem. The article introduces the architecture of Moirai, which utilizes patch-based modeling and modifications to handle heterogeneity in time series data. The model's objective is to optimize the mixture distribution log-likelihood during pre-training.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses skepticism towards the performance claims of transformers-based foundation time series models. They mention that there have been many such models released recently, all claiming to be at or near the state-of-the-art. However, the author has not found a single transformer-based model that performs better than gradient boosted tree models in their specific use case of economic forecasting. They believe that these foundational models may be overfit and that the limited benchmarking sets used in time series analysis make it easy to tune a model specifically for those benchmarks. The author calls for a broader set of varied benchmarks and independent evaluations to determine the true performance of these models.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the positive aspects of a paper's dataset and model weights being openly available. It also highlights that the paper avoids strange architectural choices commonly found in other time series foundation models. The author expresses gratitude for the potential usefulness of the paper and hopes to employ representation learning for time series during their PhD. The author also suggests that a specific baseline model should be included in all supervised time series benchmarks. They argue that many papers compare their models to a linear model without utilizing a component called RevIN, which leads to misleading comparisons. Additionally, they believe it is impractical to train transformers from scratch on datasets with less than 1 million or 1 billion points, considering this to be unwise or at least suboptimal. The author acknowledges that the discussed paper focuses on zero-shot learning, which somewhat excuses it from this criticism, but still expresses interest in comparing its performance with a supervised model combination.
