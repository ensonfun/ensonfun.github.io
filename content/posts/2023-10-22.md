## 6. [The decline of computers as a general-purpose technology (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37970572)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 This article discusses a website that uses a security service to protect itself from online attacks. It states that certain actions, such as submitting specific words or phrases, a SQL command, or malformed data, can trigger this security block. It suggests contacting the site owner to inform them about the block and includes instructions on what information to provide, including the Cloudflare Ray ID and the user's IP address. The website relies on Cloudflare for performance and security.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that the decline in productivity can be attributed to a failure of software, specifically corporate IT's failure to provide general-purpose development tools usable by all employees. Instead, non-programmers are stuck using programs that do not meet their needs, forcing them to work around these limitations. The author provides an example of a woman at a bank who manually searches and verifies data entries that could easily be done by a computer. The article emphasizes the need for computers to serve and assist humans rather than the other way around.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the fragmentation of CPUs due to the challenges of heat dissipation and the need for more efficient transistor designs. The author mentions Koomey's Law, which combines Moore's Law and Dennard scaling, and explains how the increasing number of transistors on a chip and the decreasing power usage per transistor have led to the current situation. With the limitations of thermal management, CPUs now often have unused transistors due to the risk of overheating, resulting in "dark silicon." The author suggests that combining different fragments of CPU designs could lead to improved performance and efficiency, such as implementing user-specific processor cores on a separate "brain board" attached to the motherboard.

## 10. [The white furnace test](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37973053)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The white furnace test is a useful debugging tool in rendering. When a 100% reflective object is uniformly lit by its environment, it becomes indistinguishable from the environment itself. This test helps verify that a physically based renderer is accurately rendering the object as invisible. This test is also used to ensure that the rendering algorithm preserves energy and doesn't introduce any errors. In addition, the white furnace test can reveal bugs in the renderer implementation and is often used as a sanity check before testing the BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function). The white furnace test is an important tool in validating the integration and BRDF parts of a rendering implementation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article implemented a Physically Based Rendering (PBR) renderer by following a tutorial. However, the renderer failed the white furnace test, leading the author to realize that they had not fully understood the math they had implemented. Specifically, the random multiplications by pi and 2, as suggested by the tutorial author, did not yield the desired results.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the surprise of a particular topic reaching the top of Hacker News (HN) and mentions two furnace tests related to emissions and albedo. It also mentions the production of pixels with noise and sends greetings to path tracing enthusiasts.
