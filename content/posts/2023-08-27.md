The author details their process of setting up pfSense, a firewall and router platform, on dedicated hardware. They also mention using pfBlockerNG, a package for pfSense that blocks ads and malicious content. The author describes their efforts to create separate networks for different types of devices and to configure firewall rules to ensure that all traffic goes through the DNS server. Additionally, they provide instructions on how to configure pfBlockerNG to block specific types of content.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a hack where the author exploits a flaw in the Protobuf (Protocol Buffers) system to remove ads by changing one byte. However, the author finds some statements about Protobuf to be odd. The author argues that the "flaw" is actually a core design feature of Protobuf that allows for extensibility. Additionally, the author questions the claim that Protobuf encoding is computationally expensive to decode, stating that it is actually intended to be efficient to decode. The author suggests alternative approaches to the hack that would be less error-prone. Finally, the author clarifies that while decoding and re-encoding a message can result in different bytes due to the non-deterministic order of object fields, it is unlikely to affect the behavior of the receiver, such as the YouTube app.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

They initially collaborated with the US Air Force to improve pilot training, specifically addressing issues like fatigue. However, they have faced difficulties in securing funding for their eye tracking projects. As a result, they had to pivot towards screening for PTSD, which is still an important area of focus. The author offers to connect the reader with the founder of Senseye if desired.

## 3. [Happy 25th Birthday to Bugzilla](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37279543)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Bugzilla, a bug tracking system, is celebrating its 25th anniversary. Originally written in TCL by Terry Weissman for use at mozilla.org, it was ported to Perl to allow for more contributions. However, Bugzilla faced challenges when it came to accepting donations until the formation of Zarro Boogs Corporation, a non-profit revenue-generating entity. The corporation is separate from the Mozilla Foundation but has licensed the Bugzilla trademark. Bugzilla is planning releases for different versions, including 4.4, 5.0.4.1, 5.2, 5.1.3, and the Harmony branch, which will become Bugzilla 6. Bugzilla is also seeking contributions and aims to have Bugzilla 6 in beta or release candidate stage by the end of November.

They mention using Bugzilla for tasks related to Perl programming and engaging with Bugzilla's mailing lists and IRC. As a result of their work on Bugzilla, they were offered a job to manage Bugzilla at Mindspeed until the company's collapse and acquisition. The author concludes by expressing their fond memories of working with Bugzilla.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses dissatisfaction with Bugzilla because it was "clunky." However, after being forced to switch to Github and Gitlab, they miss features such as sorting on multiple columns and the ability to select which columns to display. They also miss interfaces that don't use JavaScript and don't interfere with their work.

## 4. [Ubus (OpenWrt micro bus architecture)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37279773)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses a project called ubus, which provides inter-process communication between different daemons and applications in OpenWrt. Ubus consists of a daemon, library, and helper tools. The ubusd daemon allows daemons to register themselves and send messages using Unix sockets and TLV messages. The libubus library simplifies development for software using ubus. The ubus command line tool allows interaction with the ubusd server, and it supports JSON format for procedures and responses. The article also mentions the uhttpd plugin for ubus calls using HTTP protocol and provides examples of using ubus over HTTP. It explains how to configure access control for ubus sessions and provides examples of ACL configurations. The article concludes with a list of common projects and the namespaces, paths, and procedures they provide in ubus.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses frustration with debugging issues on OpenWRT derivatives and wishes that the inventors of Unix had never added forms of inter-process communication (IPC) other than pipes. They criticize the complex system of stateful daemons notifying each other with numerous race conditions and no debugging capabilities. The use of shell scripts parsing JSON messages is seen as a sign of unreliable systems.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author shares a personal story about coding a prototype for an interprocess communication (IPC) system for a DTV software company back in 2009. They created a crude equivalent of protobuf, not knowing about JSON or standard dbus at the time. Despite being a rookie, the author managed to provide the performance needed for DTV metadata. They express joy in seeing such projects still thriving and realizing the importance of discovery in solving problems. The author also reflects on the current state of computing, feeling that most issues have been solved and that we are now primarily connecting existing libraries and modules instead of building new things.

**Total comment counts : 47**

### Summary

 The article describes a real-life case study of the challenges faced when developing Android apps. The author was tasked with updating a legacy app to target a higher API level set by Google. Despite minimal changes, the update caused crashes on the newest Android version. The author attempted to roll back the update but was unable to do so due to restrictions in the Android ecosystem. They had to fix the crashes and release a new version quickly. The app went through a prolonged review process by Google, causing frustration for the author. The article concludes by suggesting a move back to open web standards to regain control over app development.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article received an email that affected them both personally and professionally. Personally, they had to update 16 different open-source transit apps, which took a lot of time and effort due to issues with the plugins. They would prefer users to access the apps through the website, but most users still go to the Play Store. Professionally, the author's company is also facing challenges because they have a legacy app that needs to be updated to meet Google's requirements. This update will require a significant amount of time and resources, even though the app will be removed from the store at the end of the year.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author agrees with the challenges of Android development but points out two major mistakes made. Firstly, the author didn't test the app on the latest version of Android, which is crucial. Secondly, they released the app to 100% of the user base on Google Play, instead of doing a staged rollout. Experienced Android developers know the importance of testing on the latest version and gradually rolling out releases.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a python library called difflib and specifically focuses on the autojunk parameter of the SequenceMatcher class. The author explains that by default, the class starts classifying characters as junk once the parameter is more than 200 characters long. This can cause issues when trying to match longer input. The author recommends setting autojunk=False in the constructor to avoid this behavior. They also mention that it seems the library was originally designed for a specific application and the autojunk parameter was added later, leading to confusion for users. The article provides a link to the official documentation for further reference.

## 9. [Ancient culture torched its own homes every 60 years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37247906)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, which existed between 5500 and 2750 BC in present-day Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, was an advanced and significant society. They cultivated crops, built large structures, and used copper for tools and jewelry. However, their settlements were repeatedly burned to the ground every 60 to 80 years, a phenomenon known as the "burned house horizon." Several theories have been proposed to explain this, including deliberate burning for symbolic reasons, reinforcement of structures, or making space for new buildings. Recent experiments involving burning replica structures have shown that intentional burning was likely, and the amount of fuel required suggests that these ancient cultures had impressive logistical capabilities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the presence of ancient vitrified forts in Scotland where rocks were partially melted using fire. The reason behind this process remains unknown. The article also mentions Scottish myths linking the origin of Scots to Scythia, an area similar to the one covered by the map in question.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In Japanese culture, buildings were traditionally torn down and rebuilt periodically, even including culturally and historically significant buildings. The Japanese don't consider these rebuilt buildings as new in terms of continuity. For example, a temple can still be considered hundreds of years old, despite being torn down and rebuilt multiple times. This approach preserves the craftsmanship required to build these structures, unlike in Western culture where preservationists often have to reconstruct forgotten techniques.
