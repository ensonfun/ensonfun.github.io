## 1. [Winamp Legacy player source code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41636804)

**Total comment counts : 54**

### Summary

 The article discusses the iconic multimedia player Winamp, which was launched in 1997 by Nullsoft and is celebrated for its flexibility and compatibility with various audio formats. While its development has slowed, the source code has been opened to the community, allowing developers to modernize the player. The current Winamp desktop client is built using Visual Studio 2019 and requires specific libraries such as libvpx, libmpg123, OpenSSL, DirectX 9 SDK, and Intel IPP. The article outlines the steps needed to unpack and build these libraries, including needed tools like 7-Zip and NASM, and provides instructions for modifying certain files in the build process.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses concerns about a project's contribution guidelines as outlined in its license. Section 4 encourages users to submit improvements and fixes to the official repository, which will be reviewed by maintainers. However, Section 5 imposes restrictions that prohibit forking the code or distributing modified versions. This creates a conflict with the typical GitHub workflow of forking a repository, making changes, and submitting a pull request, as doing so would violate the license.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that the best approach for the future of a particular project is to refrain from engaging with it, even to the extent of cloning it for personal review. They believe that any engagement reflects support for the project’s current licensing stance, which is unfavorable. The author plans to revisit the project only if there is an announcement about a change in its licensing. Until then, they intend to ignore the project.

## 2. [In 1870, Lord Rayleigh used oil and water to calculate the size of molecules](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41629475)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Lord Rayleigh calculated the size of a single oil molecule using a simple experiment inspired by Benjamin Franklin's observations. Franklin, in the 1770s, noted that pouring oil on agitated water calmed the waves, leading him to conduct his own experiments with oil on a pond. Although he meticulously documented his findings, he didn't realize their molecular implications.

Over a century later, Lord Rayleigh, a prominent physicist, revisited Franklin's work in 1890. He measured a small amount of olive oil, allowing it to spread on water, and calculated the thickness of the oil layer by dividing its volume by the area it covered. Assuming this layer was a single molecule thick, Rayleigh estimated the dimensions of an oil molecule to be approximately 1.63 nanometers, later found to be very close to the actual size of about 1.67 nanometers.

The story illustrates how significant scientific insights can arise from simple experiments and highlights the value of creativity and careful observation in scientific inquiry. For those interested in further exploration of these experiments, the article suggests Charles Tanford's book, "Ben Franklin Stilled the Waves."

 In 1676, Roemer measured the speed of light by observing the orbit of Jupiter's moon Io. He noticed that Io appeared to emerge from behind Jupiter earlier as Earth approached it and later as Earth moved away, with a variation of 22 minutes over the year. From this, he estimated that light travels at 227,000 km/s, while the actual speed is about 300,000 km/s. This was a commendable approximation for his time.

 The article discusses the Millikan and Fletcher oil-drop experiment, which was designed to measure the charge of the electron. In this experiment, tiny atomized oil droplets were observed as they fell through air to determine their volume. A known electric field was used to levitate the droplets, and the calculated charge per droplet was found to cluster around multiples of a value corresponding to the charge of a single electron.

## 8. [Radioactive Tape Dispenser (1970s)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41634268)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses a 3M Model C-15 Decor Scotch tape dispenser that is slightly radioactive due to the use of thorium-containing monazite sand as ballast. This sand can be observed when the rubber base of the dispenser is pulled back. The dispenser originated from a batch slated for disposal as radioactive waste by the U.S. Army. The radioactivity was discovered in the late 1970s or early 1980s by a technician at a hospital in Alabama. The dispenser was sent to Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), where the cause of the radioactivity was identified. ORAU, a nonprofit organization, provides scientific and technical solutions and manages the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education for the U.S. Department of Energy. They do not offer appraisals for items in their collection. For questions or donations, Dr. Paul Frame can be contacted via email.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article reflects on the absurdity of how society views the relationship between nature and technology, using the example of a 55-gallon drum of tape dispensers that the U.S. Army considered radioactive waste. It contrasts the indifference toward the radioactive properties of common beach sand, which is not labeled or regulated, with the immediate regulatory response triggered by a small amount of sand being taken into an official setting. The piece emphasizes a disparity in how nature and human-created materials are perceived and managed, highlighting the complexities of regulation and public awareness.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the surprising phenomenon of generating x-rays by peeling scotch tape.
