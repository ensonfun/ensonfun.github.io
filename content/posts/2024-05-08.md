## 7. [Needle: A DFA Based Regex Library That Compiles to JVM ByteCode](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40293505)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article discusses the release of a new library called "needle" that compiles regular expressions to JVM bytecode. The library converts each regular expression into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and then compiles it into a Java class. The DFA is analyzed to improve matching efficiency by identifying required prefixes, suffixes, and infixes that can be found using String.indexOf. The library also optimizes the matching process by determining the minimum and maximum length of a match and aborting early if a match is not possible. The author compares the performance of the needle library with the Java standard library and another library called brics automaton. The results show that needle performs better in most cases, except when there are no substrings to search for, in which case brics automaton is faster. The author plans to further optimize the needle library to match or exceed the performance of brics automaton and welcomes suggestions for improvement.

## 8. [Ointers: A library for representing pointers where bits have been stolen (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40296429)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses a library called "Ointers" that allows programmers to represent pointers with stolen high bits. The library provides a small amount of free storage by stealing bits from the pointer's alignment. It also takes advantage of the organization of virtual memory space in operating systems to steal an extra bit. The number of bits that can be safely stolen depends on the microarchitecture and page table depth. The article mentions the test suite for the library and notes that contributions are welcome. The article concludes with copyright and licensing information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses different strategies for increasing memory efficiency in programming. Instead of reducing the size of pointers by stealing bits, the article suggests using indices or relative pointers. For example, in a linked list, instead of storing 64-bit prev and next pointers, storing two 16-bit offsets can be more memory efficient. Additionally, the article mentions that encoding values in the base address of pointers using virtual memory allocation can provide further memory optimization, such as conveying information about alignment and thread sharing without modifying the pointer itself.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article explains that the "ointer" is a type of pointer that is specifically designed for PowerPC and SPARC processors. However, it is also applicable and compatible with other types of processors.
