## 1. [A canonical Hamiltonian formulation of the Navier–Stokes problem](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39957107)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article presents a Hamiltonian formulation of the isotropic Navier-Stokes problem using a minimum-action principle derived from the principle of least squares. The formulation involves varying the velocities and pressure as field quantities, constructing a conserved Hamiltonian functional, and formulating the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The method can be applied to non-Hamiltonian problems as well. While there is no action integral that yields the Navier-Stokes equations in their usual form, a Hamiltonian formulation can still be found by considering a mathematically equivalent higher-order problem. The article demonstrates this through a simple example.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics is considered a beautiful way to describe classical motion in comparison to the Newtonian formulation. The Hamiltonian framework involves deriving the Hamilton-Jacobi equations by observing symmetries in space-time, even including Newton's 3 principles (F = ma and others). This formulation also transitions well into quantum mechanics, where forces are replaced with Hamiltonians. However, it is uncertain if Hamiltonians are the appropriate formulation for fluid mechanics.

## 3. [Is the frequency domain a real place?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39958260)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Fourier transform and its role in signal processing. It questions the reality of the frequency domain and whether the transform reveals a deeper truth about the universe. The article introduces the discrete cosine transform (DCT) as a simplified version of the Fourier transform. It explains the formula for DCT and how it can be used to calculate a frequency-domain matrix. The article then introduces the Walsh matrix, which consists of square waves instead of sine waves, and explains its design. It mentions the Hadamard matrix as an intermediate step in constructing the Walsh matrix. The process of generating the Walsh matrix is described, including the use of tiling algorithms.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the Fourier transform is a mathematical technique for representing time signals in a specific orthogonal vector basis. It compares this concept to representing vectors in different orthogonal bases, such as North and East directions or along a road and perpendicular to it. The article mentions that time signals, or any function for that matter, exist in an infinite-dimensional vector space, and the math behind representing them in different bases still applies. The Fourier transform uses harmonic functions as the basis vectors to represent signals in the frequency domain. It emphasizes that this representation is just as valid as any other map using different basis vectors, like the Walsh-Hadamard transform. The original time-domain representation of the signal is also considered a map, although it is often the most natural to humans.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a conversation that took place in a dynamical systems group during a master's program. The conversation revolves around the idea that energy is pumped into the system on one side and dissipated on the other. However, someone points out that the system is rotationally invariant, meaning there is no distinct left and right side. The person clarifies that they were referring to frequency space, not real space. The conversation ends with a frustrated remark about thinking in real space.

## 4. [Did any processor implement an integer square root instruction?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39959946)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses whether there have been any processors that implemented an integer square root instruction. The author mentions that while floating-point square root instructions are common, they have not seen any specifically for integers. They mention the Nintendo DS, which had a memory-mapped integer divider and square rooter, but it wasn't a native instruction. The author also references the Harris RTX 2000 Forth CPU and its military-grade sibling, the RTX 2010, which offered a multi-step square root instruction. The ENIAC, a computer from 1946, also had an accumulator controlled by a special divider/square-rooter unit. The author discusses the "Quake method" of calculating square roots, which involves calculating the inverse/reciprocal of the square root using Newton-Raphson iterations. They explain that modern CPUs and GPUs have instructions for estimating the initial guess and running subsequent iterations. The article concludes by stating that the necessity for a fast multiplier is crucial in calculating square roots and argues that single instruction square root is not as common as it may seem.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The AArch64 NEON architecture has the URSQRTE instruction, which can be used to compute an approximate inverse square root. This instruction can be helpful in situations where a fixed-precision integer is used to represent a 32-bit value with 32 fractional bits. The URSQRTE instruction computes the approximate inverse square root, halves it, and then clamps it to a range of 0 through 1-ε, where ε is equal to 2^-32. Similarly, the FRSQRTE instruction operates on 32-bit floats to compute an approximate inverse square root.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of completing a task in a single clock cycle using a large lookup table. It suggests that the size of the lookup table can potentially be reduced depending on the number of logical gates that can be executed within a clock cycle. Additionally, it mentions that the binary root of 10000 is similar to that of 100, with the only difference being the number of zeros.

## 5. [Cache is King: A guide for Docker layer caching in GitHub Actions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39956327)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses different caching strategies for Docker workflows in GitHub Actions. The author explains the concept of Docker caching, where layers of filesystem changes from previous builds can be reused to speed up subsequent builds. The first strategy mentioned is caching Docker layer blobs to the native GitHub Actions cache, but there are limitations to this approach, such as limited cache space and no possibility of sharing the cache across organizations or build systems. The second strategy involves using a Docker registry as the cache backend, specifically an inline cache where cache artifacts are embedded directly into the Docker image. The article provides examples of how to implement these caching strategies in a GitHub Action workflow.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article advises against using GitHub Actions for more advanced Continuous Integration (CI) needs, particularly when it comes to Docker caching. The author suggests using Depot or switching to self-hosted runners with large disks instead.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author has tried various solutions at their company but found them to be slow and ineffective, as only successful builds get their layers cached. They believe the only viable option is to have a self-hosted runner with a large disk.

## 9. [Structuralism as a Philosophy of Mathematics](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39954993)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the philosophical position known as structuralism in mathematics. It emphasizes that what matters in mathematics are the structures that mathematical objects inhabit, rather than the specific properties of individual objects. The article gives examples of the structural roles played by different numbers in various mathematical systems. It distinguishes between structural roles and definability, noting that a mathematical object can have a unique structural role even if it is not definable in a particular system. The article also introduces the concepts of pointwise definability and Leibnizian structures, explaining that every pointwise definable structure is also Leibnizian, but the notions are distinct. Additionally, the article mentions that every Leibnizian structure must be rigid, meaning it does not have any nontrivial automorphisms.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the difficulty of determining if two programs compute the same thing and whether the complexity of one program is less than another. It mentions the relevance of isomorphism, orderings, and limits in solving these problems. The article also mentions the challenge of finding maps or examples to support structuralism in computer science. It notes that most boolean functions have exponential circuit complexity, but provides no specific examples. The power of graph isomorphism is also mentioned as an open question. The article acknowledges the value of structuralist insight but acknowledges the incompleteness in less mature fields. It highlights how knowledge is generated in these fields and then organized within a higher scheme, similar to how topology originated from Euler's attack on the Königsberg bridge problem. The article concludes that insight often comes after a significant amount of work has been done.
