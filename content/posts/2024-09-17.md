**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses a project involving hardware diagnostics, specifically the repair of a broken Elgato Game Capture HD60 S USB device. Inspired by YouTube repair channels, the author bought the nonfunctional device on eBay and found that it did not power on. After opening it up, they used a thermal camera to identify hot components, discovering potential issues with two chips—identified as Fitipower FP6373A voltage regulators—and a TI TPS60403DBV voltage inverter. Both were suspected of failing because they were not outputting the correct voltage and were heating up excessively, potentially due to previous over-voltage exposure. The author employed SMD marking code search engines to identify the chips used in the device. As the troubleshooting continued, they aimed to test the voltage output of the regulators to further diagnose the issue.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a specific type of data encoding known as fountain codes, particularly focusing on RaptorQ. It describes how this method operates by allowing data transmission even when packets are dropped randomly. However, it notes that the system does not incorporate advanced features like bandwidth adjustment or real congestion control, and it lacks a mechanism for streaming out data that the sender did not initially account for.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses confusion around benchmark numbers related to packet loss and TCP stream performance. It explains that high levels of packet loss (10-50%) render TCP streams nearly non-functional, leading to very slow progress or "pauses." Typical discussions about packet loss focus on single-digit or even less than 1% loss, which is manageable. If a protocol works effectively in high-loss scenarios, it is considered impressive. The author notes the importance of specifying which TCP algorithm is used, as different algorithms have varied strategies for handling retransmissions and performance under loss. The author also mentions that the transfer success rates for TCP at 10% and 50% loss are expected to be 0%, indicating a lack of understanding of the UDP metrics since UDP is not a streaming protocol.

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article introduces Electrico, an experimental lightweight alternative App Container designed for Electron apps, developed by Thomas Tschurtschenthaler. Written in Rust and JavaScript, Electrico utilizes the Wry/Tauri cross-platform WebView rendering library. It operates with embedded system-native Web Views for both the NodeJS backend and the Electron App-GUI, emulating Electron and Node APIs through Rust API calls and facilitating communication via XMLHttpRequests. Electrico eliminates the need to bundle Node.js and Chromium binaries, making it more lightweight. Currently, some basic Electron and Node APIs are partially implemented. The article also provides steps for running a sample app, Codex, in development mode, highlighting the integrated debugging features available.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Electrico, a project that serves as a thin wrapper around Tauri, which aims to implement a subset of the Electron API to facilitate using Tauri as a drop-in replacement for simple Electron applications. Tauri utilizes Rust libraries to create native executables without the need for Node.js or Chromium, resulting in faster startup times and a more efficient experience on Mac OS and Windows. Although Tauri requires the backend to be Rust-based, Electrico seeks to ease the learning curve by offering JavaScript APIs similar to those in Electron. The author appreciates the potential of Electrico to enhance Tauri's adoption but notes that the README does not clearly explain its advantages over Tauri. Overall, the writer finds the project promising.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the idea of creating a runtime environment similar to Electron or Tauri, which users would need to install only once. Separate applications could then be installed individually, consisting of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other assets packed in a zip file with a specific extension. The runtime would handle the installation of these apps, allowing developers to use their preferred front-end stack and deliver smaller app packages. The author questions the feasibility of this concept.
