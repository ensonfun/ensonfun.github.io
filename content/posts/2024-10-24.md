## 10. [How do merging supermassive black holes pass the final parsec?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41931244)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges in understanding how supermassive black holes merge after galaxies collide. While it was traditionally believed that these black holes become trapped in a state of infinite orbit when they are about one parsec apart—known as the "final parsec problem"—recent discoveries have suggested that they do indeed merge. Observations of gravitational waves from pulsar timing arrays point to the existence of tightly orbiting black hole pairs nearing merger.

Astrophysicists propose that dark matter may play a crucial role in overcoming this problem. Specifically, theories suggest that forms of dark matter, such as self-interacting or fuzzy dark matter, could influence the black holes' angular momentum and help them draw closer. Additionally, traditional mechanisms like dynamical friction are recognized, but they become less effective as the black holes approach one another. Overall, while the merging of supermassive black holes appears increasingly likely, researchers are exploring various theories to determine the most effective mechanisms for their coalescence.
