**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses "Twonkie," a USB-PD sniffer/injector/sink device based on Google's project Twinkie. Twonkie is a redesign of Twinkie that can be manufactured in smaller quantities by regular people. The original Twinkie design uses high-end components and a complex PCB, making it unsuitable for hobbyists. Twonkie, on the other hand, uses a simpler four-layer PCB and leaded parts for easier assembly. The article provides information on how to obtain the necessary materials and build the device. It also warns that Twonkie is not a beginner-friendly project and requires experience with soldering fine-pitch SMT parts. The hardware design of Twonkie is licensed under CC BY 4.0, and the source code for its firmware is licensed under the 3-clause BSD license.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the use of a "sniffer" device to detect and analyze Power Delivery negotiations in USB ports. The sniffer can identify any device or cable that is not functioning properly by replicating the issue and observing the component that is not following specifications. It also emphasizes that even computers participating in Power Delivery cannot monitor their own PD traffic due to the low-level handling by ASIC chips, hence the need for a separate physical device.

 The article discusses the HUSB238 USB-C breakout, which allows users to select the voltage and current for power delivery. It can be set using jumpers or I2C for dynamic querying and setting.

## 5. [Resilient Sync for Local First](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40772955)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses the local-first movement, which aims to bring data back to the user while retaining the advantages of the internet. It proposes a data exchange format that works both in the file system and on the internet. The format involves clients writing a simple, continuous log of changes, referred to as the "index", which is linked to a unique identifier for each client. The article also suggests treating larger data files separately from the changes and storing them according to the client ID and index. An example format for the data sets is provided. The article highlights the advantages of this method, including always knowing where the next data will appear. The implementation can be done as a database or in a file system, with metadata stored in a JSON file. The article concludes by mentioning that online services can choose a suitable mix of the database or file system approach.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article, who worked with a Dropbox competitor, discusses several thoughts on the use of Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for file synchronization. They highlight that the Git protocol already has some similarities to CRDTs as it allows syncing repositories without the need for GitHub or a Git server. However, they note that rewriting software to be CRDT-based and convincing the general public to adopt it would be challenging. The author also mentions that resolving conflicts when computers are disconnected from the network remains a problem for end users, as CRDTs can only identify merge conflicts but not determine the correct result. They suggest considering replicating desired workflows with Git or a similar tool, developing a "Git aware" word processor, and exploring the feasibility of incorporating a synchronization protocol or Git into software such as LibreOffice.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses ideas that are similar to what SSB implemented. It highlights the main problems with having a log, such as its size growing with every change and questions about data retention and rewriting. The article also mentions that log entries could be CRDTs, but states that if this is the case, a log is not needed as all the necessary information to sync between peers is already within the CRDT itself. A link is provided for more information on calculating diffs using CRDTs.

## 7. [The First Hedge Fund](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40782791)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 This article discusses the journey of Alfred Winslow Jones, the founder of the world's first hedge fund. Jones, who had a diverse background as a journalist, sociologist, and author, improvised his way to developing an investment style that has persisted for over half a century. Born in Australia to wealthy American parents, Jones eventually joined the crew of a tramp steamer after finishing college at Harvard. He later worked various odd jobs and joined the State Department, where he was sent to Berlin as America's vice-consul. Jones became interested in Germany's social and political troubles and secretly married a left-wing anti-Nazi activist. After resigning from the foreign service, he worked undercover for a Leninist organization in Berlin and London. As Hitler's influence grew, Jones returned to America and pursued a graduate degree in sociology at Columbia University. Inspired by the stock market crash and economic turmoil, he wrote a thesis on the link between Americans' economic status and their attitudes about property. Jones leveraged the success of his thesis to land a job as a journalist at Fortune magazine. After World War 2 ended, he wrote an essay that proposed a new model for predicting stock market changes based on investor psychology. This essay prompted Jones to start the world's first hedge fund in 1949.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the type of client a hedge fund attracts depends on the fund's size. Small funds often start with friends and family investing, while some larger funds are started by former proprietary traders. The Volker Rule stopped traders from working for banks, but those with a good track record could leave and start their own funds, taking their clients with them. Funds under $100 million usually do not attract institutional clients, such as pension funds. Fund of Funds (FOF) used to be prevalent in the industry, but it is less common today. Funds under $10 million mainly rely on the manager's own money and friends and family investments. Once a fund reaches $100 million, it may start attracting interest from institutional investors. Once a fund surpasses $500 million, it is considered part of the institutional category. Institutions prefer to invest in larger managers, but they also don't want to be the fund's sole investors. The article concludes by stating that the type of client a hedge fund has depends more on its size than its returns.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the misconception that the first hedge fund was started by Alfred W. Jones. While Jones is often credited with starting the first hedge fund, the article claims that Benjamin Graham actually started a fund in the 1920s that would be considered a hedge fund by today's standards.

## 8. [The Sun Ra Arkestra's Maestro Hits One Hundred](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40780908)

## 10. [Local First, Forever](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40786425)

**Total comment counts : 61**

### Summary

 The author discusses the concept of local-first software, which aims to prioritize user control and ownership of data. While local-first software works offline and stores data on a user's device, it still requires an online component for syncing between devices. The author suggests using widely available sync servers, such as Dropbox or iCloud Drive, to facilitate syncing. However, file syncing protocols like Dropbox are limited in functionality and lack features like conflict resolution. To overcome this, the author proposes using Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), a collection of data types that can be merged without conflicts. By using CRDTs, conflicts can be resolved by merging file states and saving them back to the synchronized state. The author demonstrates this concept using a proof-of-concept demo that utilizes CRDTs for merging text edits.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the importance of making the backend sync server available for local self-hosting in order to achieve a "forever" aspect of local-first technology. This is necessary because simply syncing flat files may not be sufficient for certain features like real-time collaboration and permission controls. The article mentions an example of a local-first multiplayer IDE for tasks and notes, where users are allowed to "eject" by saving their workspace as a zip file and switching to self-hosting the backend if desired.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenge of monetizing truly local-first applications and mentions the author's struggle to find a solution. The author's product is mostly local-first, but requires a server for live collaboration and image hosting. The author mentions considering a model similar to Obsidian, where the base app is free and payment is required for networked features like sync and publishing. However, there is limited data available on the effectiveness of this model and the necessary market size for sustainability. The author also recommends Yjs for building robust local-first and collaborative apps, as it offers interesting technical and design challenges.
