**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 PostHog, an open-source project, is closing its public Slack group and inviting members to join their new community forum on their website. With over 5,000 members, PostHog has outgrown Slack as a platform due to issues such as disappearing messages and lack of searchability. Instead of using a pre-made forum platform, PostHog has created its own forum using Strapi as a headless CMS. The new forum allows users to post questions, receive answers, and select preferred solutions. The forum is integrated into the website and searchable by search engines. Profiles are also a key feature of the forum, allowing users to share information and track discussions. Users who join the new community from the public Slack group will receive a unique achievement. The public Slack group will be closed permanently on January 22, with private Slack channels and GitHub repos continuing to function normally.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes the author's encounter with a user who programs 3D AR/VR content using a dual-screen device. The top screen is used for VR scenes, while the bottom screen is used for coding. The user's interactions between the screens and keyboard were seamless, and the screen colors were vibrant even in bright light. The author suggests that the device can be used for office work or website programming. However, the author noticed graphics lag and chop in the VR scenes and the user mentioned that the battery didn't last long enough for a full day of use. The article concludes that the device may not be ideal for developing 3D, AR, VR projects, but opinions may vary.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that if you already have an iPad but use Windows or Linux on your laptop, you can use the iPad as an external monitor. To do this, you will need a cheap HDMI USB capture device, a short HDMI cable to connect it to your laptop's HDMI output, a USB to lightning or USB to type C adapter (depending on your iPad model), and a free app called Genki Studio to display the UVC camera input full screen. While this method may not be as convenient, it does not add much weight to your bag.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article believes that the product being discussed does not solve a real problem in birding. They argue that binoculars are best for looking with the eyes, but holding them at eye level can cause fatigue, so they need to be lightweight. They also mention that cameras with expensive lenses are better for taking photos, as they have the reach and resolution needed. The author sees the product as targeting people with more money than sense, as they believe it is too heavy and will take too long to identify birds. They suggest that the ability to take photos is often found in gimmicky binoculars for a reason.

## 8. [Researchers trace a form of lupus back to a single mutation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38986320)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology have discovered a mechanism that can trigger lupus in children. The mechanism regulates the amount of a specific immune receptor that normally recognizes the genetic material of pathogens. If this mechanism is disrupted, receptors accumulate in the immune cells, leading to the recognition of the body's own genetic material. This causes the immune system to turn against its own body and causes the systemic inflammation of lupus. The researchers identified a lupus patient with a mutation in this mechanism, and their findings have been published in the journal Science Immunology. This discovery could lead to new approaches to therapy for lupus.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that the cause of the lupus was identified as a single letter change in the case of one patient. The reader was hoping to find information about whether this change was also the cause for other lupus patients, but the article does not provide any news on this.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests the possibility of a viral trigger for mutations related to autoimmune diseases such as lupus. It proposes conducting a longitudinal study to examine if these mutations are present at birth or acquired later in life.

## 9. [OpenD, a D language fork that is open to your contributions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38986546)

### Summary

 The article discusses the frustrations of contributing to the D programming language and highlights the lack of openness and community input in its development. It mentions the success of community contributions in shaping D but also points out the patches that have been left unaddressed. It brings up the Ares/Tango fork, which was created when contributors were not able to have their contributions accepted by the D leadership. This fork ultimately saved D and led to a golden age of development. However, the article notes that old habits returned, causing a decline in activity and a lack of new contributors. The author expresses their frustration and concludes that they do not fit into the current development process.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes that Walter and other individuals in the D leadership are active on the platform, indicating that there is a high likelihood they will come across readers' comments. It serves as a reminder that they are humans who genuinely care about D and are well-intentioned, based on the writer's personal experience.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the decline of the programming language D and the reasons behind it. The author mentions that many of the features that made D popular have now been implemented in other languages like C#, Java, and C++, although the implementation may not be as elegant. Additionally, the lack of stability and focus on new features has led to a decline in popularity. The author notes that even Andrei Alexandrescu, one of the main contributors to D, is now more involved with C++ and CUDA. The rise of native programming languages in the past decade has also added to the competition. Despite this, the author acknowledges that the D community is still filled with knowledgeable individuals.
