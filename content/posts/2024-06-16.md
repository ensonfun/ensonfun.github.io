 The best technology stack for starting a startup is one that you already know and don't have to learn. It's important not to overwhelm yourself with learning a new tech stack while also managing other aspects of starting a company. Your users prioritize a working product, so choose a stack that allows you to develop quickly. If necessary, you can refactor and migrate to a better stack later, although this is rarely needed. The author personally deployed to Elastic Beanstalk and used Mongo because they were already familiar with these technologies. They also chose not to use React initially, but this decision may vary for different individuals. Ultimately, it's best to build your app on the technology you are comfortable with.

## 10. [NLRB judge declares non-compete clause is an unfair labor practice](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40696992)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 In a recent decision, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Sarah Karpinen ruled in favor of a union organizer who was fired by his employer. The case involved "salting," where the union organizer was hired by the company to organize his coworkers. The organizer lied about his employment history to get hired and declared his role as a union organizer after being hired. The judge ruled that salting is protected activity, lying about employment history for salting is also protected, and firing someone for salting is unfair labor practice. As a result, the judge ordered the employer to rehire the salt with backpay. Additionally, the General Counsel (GC) of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) argued that the employer's non-compete and coworker non-solicitation clauses were illegal work rules. The judge determined that the non-compete clause was overly broad and would discourage employees from engaging in protected activities. The coworker non-solicitation clause was also deemed illegal as it would dissuade employees from engaging in protected activity and discussing union benefits. This is the first time an ALJ has ruled that these types of clauses violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).
