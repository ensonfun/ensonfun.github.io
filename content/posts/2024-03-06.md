## 3. [OpenAI and Elon Musk](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39611484)

**Total comment counts : 105**

### Summary

 The article discusses the relationship between OpenAI and Elon Musk, as well as OpenAI's mission to ensure the benefits of artificial general intelligence (AGI) are distributed to humanity. OpenAI originally planned to raise $100 million, but Elon Musk suggested announcing a $1 billion funding commitment. Over time, it became clear that building AGI required large amounts of funding. Elon Musk left OpenAI to create a competitor to Google/DeepMind, and later proposed merging OpenAI with Tesla. However, disagreements arose over control and mission alignment. OpenAI has made its technology accessible to the public and has collaborated with various organizations to improve people's lives. Elon Musk understood that OpenAI's mission did not necessarily mean open-sourcing AGI. OpenAI expresses sadness over the strained relationship with Musk but remains focused on advancing its mission.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

It argues that although there is a decent justification for the shift in focus towards profits, it does not negate the fact that their core mission was seemingly abandoned. The article agrees that the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) will require significant computational power and funding, and it acknowledges the need for profitability to support expertise and resources. However, it criticizes the organization for misleading others by changing its name and mission while still benefiting from donations under the guise of a non-profit status.

## 4. [Embedded Swift on the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39611111)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses the creation of a small "toolchain" for building pure Swift executables for the Raspberry Pi Pico. The toolchain, represented by a Makefile, is designed to work with the Pico but may also be compatible with other RP2040 boards. Unlike previous approaches, this toolchain does not use the Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK, resulting in less build system complexity. While the toolchain is still in its early stages and lacks certain functionalities, it provides a clean slate for experimentation and learning. The main application code is written in Swift, with minimal C and Assembly code involved for bootstrapping. The author hopes to integrate SwiftPM into the toolchain to make it easier to incorporate other packages. The article also discusses the potential use of Swift SDKs for embedded platforms and the benefits of creating a separate package for platform-specific functionalities. The author expresses interest in exploring the new 387 stuff (FP coprocessor support) and suggests the possibility of using the Swift linker in the future.

## 7. [Network Tunneling with QEMU](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39613198)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article discusses how cyberattackers use legitimate tools, such as network tunneling software, to evade detection and carry out attacks. The author specifically mentions the utilities ngrok and FRP as commonly used tools. The article also describes an incident where the attackers used QEMU, a virtualizer, to connect to a compromised system and gain access to the corporate network. The author then explains how they tested this technique and provides a diagram of the network tunnel setup.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their recent use of a method to create a virtual machine (VM) service using libvirt, which does not support the QEMU socket type interface. To overcome this limitation, the author modifies the VM's XML by adding specific code. The code includes parameters to establish a network socket and a virtio-net-pci device. Additionally, a Linux TAP tunnel daemon is mentioned as being responsible for encapsulating packets to maintain the integrity of the VM. The approach allows for the creation of a layer 2 tunnel from a remote site to the VM while keeping the VM separate from the network.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions a type of malware that uses a virtual machine running a small operating system called TinyXP to hide itself from the main operating system. TinyXP has a small memory footprint and can evade reverse engineering techniques used to analyze malware behavior.

## 8. [Fonts are still a Helvetica of a Problem](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39612484)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 Canva, a graphic design platform, discovered vulnerabilities related to font processing tools. Fonts, which have a complex history and specifications, present a unique challenge for developers who need to interpret these specifications across multiple formats. Previous research focused on memory corruption bugs in font processing, but Canva explored other security issues that could occur when handling fonts. They found that the SVG format, commonly associated with web security problems, also appears in digital typography in two unique ways. Fonts that follow the sfnt container structure contain auxiliary tables, including poorly documented or proprietary ones, such as the SVG table. By analyzing how FontTools processes the SVG table, Canva discovered that the default XML parser used resolves entities, which can lead to an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability. An attacker could construct an XML payload to exploit this vulnerability and gain unauthorized access. Canva also discussed font compression and subsetting operations and how the implementation in FontTools version 4.28.2 added support for subsetting the SVG table. However, this feature introduced a misconfiguration that allowed the resolution of arbitrary entities, leading to potential security risks. Canva suggested the need for improved security measures and awareness when handling fonts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes an incident that occurred in 2011 where a PDF file was used to jailbreak iPhones. The attack involved modifying an open source font library by removing bounds checking from one of its functions. The attacker waited for 12 months to see if the change had been noticed or fixed before creating a PDF file containing the modified font and releasing it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a timeline graphic that is a PNG with text on it. The author mentions that when viewing the graphic on Firefox + M1 MacBook, the image is not scaled properly for high-resolution screens, causing blurry text. The article then goes on to mention the use of SVG code.

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses the release of the pre-release version of OS/2 2.0, which was a 32-bit operating system developed by Microsoft. This version was released in June 1990 and was intended to be the first mass-market 32-bit PC operating system. It was a hybrid operating system, with certain components being 16-bit and others being 32-bit. The objective of OS/2 2.0 was to run existing 16-bit OS/2 1.x applications. However, the article mentions that there was a problem with launching DOS boxes in the pre-release version due to an invalid instruction used by Microsoft. Despite this issue, OS/2 2.0 was considered a major improvement over its predecessor, OS/2 1.x.

They highlight the advantage of OS/2's protected mode, which prevented hard disk damage when encountering memory bugs. The author mentions porting their work to Rational's 286 DOS Extender to fix compiler bugs related to the mixed 16-bit memory model. Lastly, they mention the risks of writing through a null pointer in real mode DOS and criticize the decision to locate the interrupt vector table at address 0. They suggest that this architectural mistake can lead to freezing or data loss.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author recounts their experience as a support representative for an ISP. One particular phone call stood out, where a customer selected Mac support even though they were running OS/2 Warp, as they did not want a Windows support person to try to fix their Windows operating system. The customer seemed to enjoy mentioning that they were running OS/2 Warp, possibly seeking appreciation for being an outlier. The author reflects on the camaraderie shared among those who used non-Microsoft operating systems, recalling a conversation with their girlfriend's father, who was enthusiastic about his Amiga.

### Summary

 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Dexcom Stelo Glucose Biosensor System, the first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor (CGM). This device is intended for individuals 18 years and older who do not use insulin, such as those with diabetes who treat their condition with oral medications or individuals without diabetes who want to monitor the impact of diet and exercise on their blood sugar levels. The system uses a wearable sensor and a smartphone application to continuously measure, record, analyze, and display glucose values. It should be noted that the device does not alert users to low blood sugar levels. The FDA's approval of this OTC CGM aims to expand access to health information and promote health equity. Users should consult with their healthcare provider before making any medical decisions based on the device's readings. Adverse events reported during the clinical study included local infection, skin irritation, pain, or discomfort.

They first wrote about their experience with the device in 2018. The author, who has Type 1 diabetes, considers the wearable device to be a game-changer. They even started a company focused on continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), but it didn't succeed. However, the author is considering giving it another try.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author had a health event where they passed out, and their wife suspected it might be hypoglycemia due to the author's high risk for diabetes. The author was put on a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) for two weeks, but did not experience hypoglycemia during that time. However, the author found the data from the CGM to be interesting and it helped them make healthier choices. The author compares using a CGM to tracking steps with a smart watch, as it encourages people to take action based on the data. The author tried to get a CGM from their family in India but the prices were high. They believe that CGMs could be beneficial for preventing pre-diabetic individuals from taking preventative steps, if it were easier to consistently measure.
