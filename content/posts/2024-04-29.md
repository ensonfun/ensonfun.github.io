## 1. [Atomic nucleus excited with laser: A breakthrough after decades](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40194636)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 Physicists have achieved a major breakthrough by exciting the "thorium transition" using lasers. This discovery opens the door to revolutionary high precision technologies, such as nuclear clocks. The thorium transition is a specific state of thorium atomic nuclei that has been sought after by scientists for years. By using a laser to transfer the atomic nuclei into a higher energy state and tracking its return to its original state, researchers can combine quantum physics and nuclear physics. The key to this success was the development of special thorium-containing crystals. This achievement has significant implications for precision measurements and fundamental questions in physics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Two different groups have confirmed the measurement of a nuclear transition using Thorium-doped crystals. This is significant because impurities in the crystals can cause fluorescence that may be mistaken for a signal from the Thorium ions. The fact that two separate groups have observed the same signal in different crystals adds to the credibility of the discovery. The article confirming the measurement can be found at the following link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12311](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12311)

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience of creating a publishing workflow management system for a major newspaper using Perl 4. Despite being limited to Perl 4 and not being allowed to use a database, the author managed to develop a software that routed page images to presses, generated PDFs of each page and edition, and published them on a static website. The system also included a postscript parser to extract data from completed newspaper pages. The author was initially told that the software would only run temporarily until a commercial product replaced it, but it has been functioning since its launch in January 2002. The software currently handles about 80% of its original intended functions and is still in use by hundreds of people daily. Various attempts to replace it have failed over the past 22 years, possibly due to both the author's unconventional code and the resistance of their old boss, who still works at the newspaper.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses their appreciation for Postgres but mentions that one aspect they find challenging is managing roles. They describe the interface as confusing and insufficiently documented, requiring trial and error to figure out how things work. The author suggests the need for a comprehensive "cookbook" to make working with roles easier, stating that if even just one person can use it without frustration, it would be valuable.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article advises using "lock_timeout" when running schema migrations in production. Even seemingly harmless modifications, such as dropping a table with foreign keys or dropping a foreign key, can cause lock conflicts in a heavily-used production database. The ALTER command will wait for the lock of the first transaction, which in turn prevents any queries from running against the locked table. Therefore, it is recommended to use "lock_timeout" to avoid blocking all other queries and to allow the migration to fail after the specified timeout. The article highlights that encountering these conflicts is inevitable when dealing with PostgreSQL at scale.

## 4. [Husband and wife outed as GRU spies aiding bombings and poisonings across Europe](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40199193)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses the role of GRU Unit 29155, a Russian assassination and sabotage squad, in blowing up ammunition warehouses in Czechia. It reveals that a family of deep-cover Russian spies, Elena and Nikolai Šapošnikov, served as arms dealers and facilitated these bombings. The Šapošnikovs operated from Villa Elena, a hotel in Greece, which served as a safehouse for members of Unit 29155. The Czech Intelligence Center for Counter-Terrorism and Organized Crime recently released the results of its investigation into Unit 29155's involvement in the destruction of weapons depots in Czechia. It implicates operatives Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga, who gained international attention for attempting to murder Sergei Skripal in England in 2018. The Šapošnikovs not only facilitated access to the warehouses in Czechia but also communicated directly with the founding commander of Unit 29155, General Andrei Averyanov. The article further reveals that the wife, Elena Šapošnikova, was directly affiliated with Unit 29155 and likely directed and supervised her husband's activities. The family's duties ranged from intelligence-gathering to logistical support for the GRU's operations. Elena Šapošnikova even possessed a secret Russian service passport and received the Hero of Russian Federation title from Vladimir Putin. Czech authorities have declared the Šapošnikovs "persons of interest" and requested their questioning by Greek authorities. Nikolai Šapošnikov passed away in Greece in February 2024.

## 8. [Pdf.tocgen](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40187072)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 pdf.tocgen is a set of command-line tools for automatically extracting and generating a table of contents (ToC) for PDF files. It works by using the font attributes and position of headings to determine the structure of the file. The process involves using the pdfxmeta command to create a recipe file, using pdftocgen to generate the ToC, and then importing it back into the PDF file. The tool is designed to work with software-generated PDFs, not scanned documents. It is free software and written in Python 3. The tools can be installed via various methods, such as pip or AUR. The intended use is for readers to easily navigate lecture notes or drafts, rather than for authors to generate ToCs for their own manuscripts. The design of pdf.tocgen is influenced by the Unix philosophy, with the three separate programs representing the three steps needed to add a ToC to a PDF file. To create a recipe, pdfxmeta is used to extract metadata from the PDF file, and the attributes of headings can be specified in the recipe file.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article explains that they have settled on using ChatGPT's GPT-4v's multimodal capability to generate a text file containing the titles and pages based on screenshots of the table of contents (TOC). They then use a pikepdf-based Python script to add the TOC into the PDF. This approach is advantageous because it works for both text-based and scanned PDFs. However, it requires adjustments to the PDF, such as including any missing empty pages and calculating offsets for prologs and covers. Manual intervention is also necessary in this process.
