## 1. [Deepmind Alphadev: Faster sorting algorithms discovered using deep RL](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36228125)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to discover new and efficient algorithms for fundamental tasks such as sorting and hashing. The authors formulated the task of finding better sorting algorithms as a single-player game and trained an AI agent, AlphaDev, to play this game and discover small sorting algorithms that outperformed previously known human benchmarks. The AI-generated algorithms have been integrated into the LLVM standard C++ sort library and represent the replacement of a component with an algorithm that has been discovered using reinforcement learning. The authors also demonstrate the generality of the approach by applying it to other domains.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 AlphaDev claimed to have uncovered new algorithms that improved the sorting performance of the LLVM libc++ sorting library by up to 70%, but according to a critic, no new algorithms were actually discovered. The improvement was due to a sequence of assembly that saved one MOV, based on an unrolled insertion sort on three elements. The patch for libc++ was faster for small inputs due to the library not having an efficient implementation with a branchless sorting network beforehand. While the reinforcement learning approach worked, the article and surrounding press release have been criticized for being self-aggrandizing in their results and impact.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 AlphaDev has discovered faster sorting and hashing algorithms, using a combination of assembly, compiler optimizations, and balancing both correctness and distribution. Although the approach does not involve revolutionary new methods, it has converged to a point where optimal programs are inhuman but perform better. By removing some instructions in sorting parallel instructions can run, causing less profound effects. When it comes to hashing, shorter strings use three instructions, which rises in complexity for bigger strings. However, the distribution on real workloads was deemed good enough to use in production, with the new algorithm reducing multiplication and rotation with the key improved from nine to 16.

 The practical application of Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) is to use it as an ultra-accurate detector of gravity that can create a map of the world based on variations in the gravitational constant g. This technology would allow nuclear submarines to navigate without surfacing for GPS lock, eliminating one of the primary reasons for sub surfacing. It is considered a potential moneymaker for the subfield.

## 8. [From SVG to Canvas – A new way of building interactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36217098)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article describes how a new interaction handling system was developed for the Felt app after switching from SVG to Canvas. The new system uses InteractionHandlers that are responsible for specific interactions instead of having each element manage its own interactions, resulting in less resource allocation and better access control. The system has a flexible design that separates rendering and interaction handling, making it possible to switch rendering targets while leaving interactions unchanged. The new system also allows for more complex interactions, such as dragging through unselected elements while still being able to click on them to make a selection.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article talks about the benefits of using InteractionHandlers, which are objects that satisfy a specific TypeScript interface and are not coupled to React or hooks. This approach feels freeing and eliminates worries about stale closures, dependencies, and hook rules. The article also discusses the concept of "fighting the framework" and how frameworks may not always fit the product, leading to complete rewrites. The author advises others to realize that almost everyone fights the framework eventually, and the more the framework can do, the earlier the fight begins.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the lack of attention given to accessibility for digital content for disabled individuals in the development of the SVG to canvas feature. The author asserts that this lack of attention is a disservice to people who are deaf, blind, have difficulty hearing or seeing, have motor impairments, or are elderly. The author urges developers to follow the WCAG guidelines for accessibility.

**Total comment counts : 96**

### Summary

 Former intelligence official David Grusch has claimed that the US government possesses vehicles of non-human origin and that information about it is being illegally withheld from Congress. In an interview with journalists Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal, Grusch, who led analysis of unexplained anomalous phenomena within a US Department of Defense agency, said the vehicles were “of exotic origin” and had been recovered for decades. His account was later confirmed by another US intelligence official at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (Nasic), who added: “We are not alone.” The Pentagon has released a report on UAP – the term preferred by alien enthusiasts – which found over 140 instances of UAP encounters that could not be explained.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a claim made by an individual who did not witness the events himself but was shown some documents by individuals he trusts. The author suspects that this claim is part of a psychological operation conducted by the US government to identify people who are inclined to believe in vague evidence and manipulate them to leak information through curated fake evidence.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author questions the credibility of recent claims made by a man regarding alien contact, noting that they are similar to many other claims in the past. However, the author acknowledges that the man's career history implies he may be more reliable. The article also notes the irony that one of the people supporting the man's claims shares the surname "Grey". While the author would love to believe in alien contact, they find it unlikely when considering the physics and mechanics involved.
