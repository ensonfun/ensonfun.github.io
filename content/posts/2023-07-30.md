### Summary

 Snowflake is a system that helps people access censored websites and applications by disguising their internet activity. It operates similarly to VPNs, but instead of installing a separate application, Snowflake is embedded within existing apps. By redirecting internet traffic or scrambling it, Snowflake makes it difficult for censors to block access without blocking a large portion of the internet. Snowflake proxies are operated by volunteers, and users are matched with random proxies. If individuals want to help bypass censorship, they can install and run a Snowflake proxy. Different methods, from the web extension to embedding it in a personal website, are available to run a Snowflake proxy. If users encounter any issues, they can file a bug report or seek support through the Tor Support Channel. Snowflake is continuously being improved as part of the Pluggable Transports family.

 The article discusses the use of domain fronting as a technique for rendezvous in the digital realm. It explains that domain fronting is often used by malicious actors, and some cloud providers are now blocking it by default. AWS, for example, expressed concerns that if domain fronting was widely implemented, countries like Iran and China could block all of AWS. The article provides links for more information on domain fronting and the actions taken by cloud providers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a relay for Tor users to access Tor when normal guard relays are blocked. This relay uses domain fronting and webrtc technology. However, the article's confusing translation suggests that the target website also needs to support webrtc, making it impossible to access HTTP(S) websites through this in-browser proxy. The article claims that no separate software is needed to visit censored websites, but in reality, a Tor client is required to use this snowflake proxy.

## 4. [ASML EUV lithography machine could keep Moore’s Law on track](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36926228)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the development of high-numerical-aperture extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lithography as the next generation of lithography for shrinking device geometries in the semiconductor industry. The resolution of photolithography has improved over the years through factors such as wavelength, numerical aperture, and process control. The switch to EUV from 193-nanometer light helped decrease critical dimensions, and now the focus is on increasing the numerical aperture from 0.33 to 0.55. However, increasing the numerical aperture poses challenges, such as the need for anamorphic optics to manage the angle of reflection. The article also mentions the efforts to design and manufacture the necessary components for high-NA EUV systems and the plan to open a lab for further development. Ultimately, high-NA EUV is critical for the advancement of Moore's Law in the semiconductor industry.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that generating extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light requires a complex process involving hitting molten tin droplets with a CO2 laser. The laser vaporizes the tin, creating a plasma that emits a spectrum of photonic energy. The EUV optics then capture the 13.5-nm wavelength from this spectrum and direct it through mirrors. The light is reflected off a patterned mask and projected onto a wafer. The author finds this process incredible and mentions its successful implementation in commercial systems that can produce hundreds of chip wafers per hour.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

They were initially skeptical about the success of these machines due to the complex technological challenges involved. However, they are now glad that the machines were able to work, as it enables printing on a smaller scale.

## 5. [Scientists may have found mechanism behind cognitive decline in aging](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36929090)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 Scientists at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus have identified a potential mechanism behind cognitive decline in normal aging. They found that the mis-regulation of a brain protein called CaMKII, which is important for memory and learning, may be responsible for the decline. Altering this protein in mouse models produced similar cognitive effects as those seen in normal aging. The researchers discovered that normal aging decreases the modification of CaMKII known as S-nitrosylation, which in turn reduces memory and learning ability. The findings could lead to the development of pharmacological treatments to normalize the nitrosylation of the protein and potentially delay cognitive decline associated with normal aging. However, the treatment would not be effective for the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a study in which researchers discovered that altering the CaMKII brain protein in mice led to cognitive effects similar to those observed in normal aging. The study suggests that this protein plays a role in age-related cognitive decline.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article has experienced a cognitive decline in the past few years, likely due to long covid. They attribute this decline to the side effects of long covid, particularly severe insomnia. While the insomnia has improved, the author still feels that their cognitive abilities haven't fully returned, which is concerning to them.

## 7. [Button Pushes You (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36926165)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of a "Call to Action" (CTA) in interface design. A CTA is a text label on a button or widget that directs users towards specific goals within an application, website, or device. Traditional CTAs typically present actions that users can activate to change the system's state. However, a new style of button labeling has emerged that focuses on reconfiguring the user's state rather than the system's state. These buttons, labeled with phrases like "Get started" or "Explore," require users to change their attitude or mindset before accessing the next piece of information. This reconfiguration work is entirely on the user's side, as the computer does not assist in completing this task. The article also explores the difference between buttons and links, emphasizing the communicative role of buttons and their ability to change the state of an application. It discusses interface design guidelines from dominant players like Apple, Microsoft, and Google, highlighting the shift in the role of buttons in Material Design 3. The article concludes by suggesting that this new style of button labeling, called "Button Pushes You" (BPY), represents a shift in user interfaces, as users are tricked into performing work for the system by redefining established elements.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the annoyance caused by obtuse labeling of buttons, particularly when trying to access API documentation for a new framework. The author suggests that this style of labeling, which progresses from function to call to action to obfuscated self-help style language, is a trend in marketing. They speculate that it may work in A/B testing but question its effectiveness in general. The author also connects this trend to a callback to 1960s language and an appeal to nostalgia, as well as a form of vaguely insulting corporate-speak.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author shares their strategy of relabeling a button from "Maybe Later" to "Fuck off" in order to dismiss a modal without feeling pressured by the button.

## 10. [Critical theory is radicalizing high school debate](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36920566)

**Total comment counts : 79**

### Summary

 The article discusses how competitive debate has shifted from focusing on public policy and critical thinking to becoming dominated by critical theory arguments known as kritiks. These kritiks propose complex social criticisms based on various theories and reject spending time on the assigned topics. The author argues that this shift undermines the goal of teaching students how to engage in pragmatic policy discussions and instead promotes a worldview that condemns American institutions and society. The article also highlights how kritiks have become popular in high school debate tournaments and have influenced the next generation of debaters. The author expresses concern about the long-term impact of this trend on American politics and the potential for the activity to become a site of radicalization.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the flaws and problematic practices in high school debate. It highlights the focus on winning rather than the exchange of ideas. In policy debate, a tactic called 'spreading' involves speaking rapidly to present numerous points, making it difficult for the opposing team to address them all. In Lincoln Douglas debate, there is a strategy called 'collapsing tautology' where arguments are constructed to appear logical but are actually unrefutable traps. Overall, high school debate is seen as a realm of politics and persuasion, where knowing the judges, having charisma, and utilizing effective strategies matter more than the actual content of the arguments. The article argues that while the introduction of new controversial strategies might be noteworthy, it does not ruin debate any more than other existing problematic practices, and students generally do not care about these strategies or the validity of the ideas behind them.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the idea of rhetoric as a virtue and the importance of arguing in good faith. The author shares a personal story about their grandfather's training in a yeshiva, where students had to defend opposing sides of an argument with equal logic and vigor. The author suggests that learning to see through rhetorical tricks is valued beyond the ability to convince others. The article also mentions that there is nothing inherently wrong with breaking the rules of a debate to win, but failing to consider the unlikeable part of an argument is seen as cheating and will ultimately lead to failure.
