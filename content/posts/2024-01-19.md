## 2. [Winding down Google Sync and Less Secure Apps support](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39052196)

**Total comment counts : 48**

### Summary

 Starting from June 15, 2024, password-based IMAP, CalDAV, CardDAV, SMTP, POP, and Exchange ActiveSync (Google Sync) will no longer work for customers connecting to an LSA for the first time. Google Endpoint Management users will also be unable to activate "Custom Push Configuration" settings for CalDAV and CardDAV. 

From September 30, 2024, password-based IMAP, CalDAV, CardDAV, SMTP, POP, and Exchange ActiveSync (Google Sync) will no longer work for existing users. Administrators will need to push a Google Account through their MDM provider, which will add Google accounts to iOS devices using OAuth.

For users of Outlook 2016 or earlier, it is recommended to switch to Microsoft 365 or Outlook for Windows or Mac, both of which support OAuth access. Another option is to use Google Workspace Sync for Microsoft Outlook.

Users of Thunderbird or other email clients should re-add their Google Account and configure it to use IMAP with OAuth.

For users of the Mail app on iOS or macOS, or Outlook for Mac, who currently use only a password to log in, they will need to remove and re-add their account. When adding it back, they should select "Sign in with Google" to automatically use OAuth. 

Additional resources for Google Workspace admins are also provided, including the Google Cloud Community where users can connect with others, participate in discussions, and access helpful articles. The "What's new in Google Workspace?" Help Center page is recommended for learning about new products and features launching in Google Workspace.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the removal of support for "Less Secure Apps" in Gmail. The author mentions that app passwords will still work, but expresses concern about the potential impact on automation if Google were to only support OAuth. They also mention their dislike for the complexity of OAuth and share a link to Perl module documentation explaining it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that users who cannot switch to OAuth can utilize a specific proxy to enable any IMAP or POP/SMTP client to be used with a modern email provider, even if the client does not support OAuth 2.0. The proxy can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy, and there is no requirement for the client to have any knowledge of OAuth.

## 4. [AlphaFold Found Possible Psychedelics](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39049703)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 Researchers have utilized the protein-structure-prediction tool AlphaFold to identify potential new psychedelic molecules, which could aid in the development of new antidepressant drugs. This demonstrates that AlphaFold predictions can be as useful as experimentally derived protein structures for drug discovery. AlphaFold, developed by DeepMind, has been a game changer in the field of biology, and its predictions are available in a public database. While some scientists had doubts about the reliability of AlphaFold predictions, this research shows that the tool is promising for drug design. However, there has been skepticism regarding using AlphaFold's predictions for drug discovery, as some studies have found them to be less useful compared to experimental protein structures. Nevertheless, the recent study found that AlphaFold's predicted structures were able to identify promising drug candidates that interact with specific proteins. The hit rates for compounds identified using predicted and experimental structures were nearly identical. This discovery showcases the potential of AlphaFold in drug discovery, particularly for targeting G-protein-coupled receptors.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the discovery of potential molecules that bind to 5HT2A, which is noteworthy. However, the most important finding is that AF2 models can be effectively used to identify binders to GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptors). GPCRs are a major target for drug development, and previous studies suggested that expensive simulations were needed for accurate predictions of GPCR binding molecules. If this research is correct, AF2 can provide detailed information, previously believed to require costly simulations, thus eliminating the need for these calculations. This breakthrough has the potential to win the Nobel Prize and represents significant progress in recent decades.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that while artificial intelligence may replace human jobs, it also assists people in getting high. The author expresses enthusiasm about this future.

## 5. [Culture Change at Google](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39051655)

**Total comment counts : 51**

### Summary

 The article, written by Ben Collins-Sussman, reflects on the cultural shift at Google over the past decade. The author discusses how in the early days, Google highly valued its employees and would carefully move them between projects instead of laying them off. This approach was based on the belief that employees were the company's most precious resource. However, with changes in leadership and a shift towards a "culture of limited resources," the author notes that layoffs have become more common, particularly during the pandemic. The article emphasizes that while Google is still a great place to work, there has been a significant departure from the early culture that prioritized employee value and retention.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how companies become reluctant to take risks when resources are limited. It highlights that instead of making significant bets to regain revenue, they tend to chase trends. The author believes that part of the problem is the shift from domain-focused leadership to generalist business types, lacking expertise in finding new markets. The article also mentions that stability-oriented careerists are attracted to companies that offer sustainable salaries and stock, making them less inclined to take risks or disrupt the existing business model. Thus, the cycle of risk-averse business practices continues, making it challenging to create a large company that simultaneously has a stable business model and takes appropriate risks.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the changes that have occurred in Google over time. The author argues that the company has lost its "total internal transparency" as it has grown, and that it now requires different types of engineers and product people. The author also mentions that employees no longer have the same level of wealth and therefore engage in political games to secure higher compensation. The article concludes that the real world has started to impact the company's operations.

## 6. [Cracking the code of Linear B](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39047102)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article discusses the discovery and background of the Linear B tablets, which were found at Knossos on the island of Crete. The first tablets were discovered in the late 19th century, but it wasn't until the early 20th century that a systematic excavation took place under the direction of Arthur Evans. Evans found over 4,000 Linear B tablets, as well as evidence of two other writing systems: Cretan Hieroglyphic and a less polished linear script. The tablets were initially left unpublished after Evans' death in 1941, but eventually, Sir John Myres took on the task of publishing them. The article highlights the significance of the tablets and their eventual decipherment.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes the decipherment of Linear B, suggesting that it is a con job and that Ventris' grid method is cryptographic nonsense. The author implies that Chadwick, a Greek lexicographer, recognized that loose spelling rules and a large lexicon of ancient Greek allow for infinite decipherment possibilities. The article also mentions an example where English names were converted into Linear B and then back into Greek, always resulting in the name of a Greek god. Another example given is the conversion of the first line of Virgil's Aeneid into Linear B and then Greek, which produces a creative interpretation related to a ruined city in Tholoia.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the absurdity of Michael Ventris' belief in the Etruscan language and questions the validity of his claims. The author mentions the lack of evidence to support Ventris' theory, pointing out that the Etruscans were mainly located on the western coast of Italy and did not have extensive travel or colonies in other locations. The article concludes by suggesting that Ventris may have made a high school mistake in his research.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article suggests a different theory for the decline of Google. They believe that Google's original approach of hiring the best programmers and giving them freedom did not result in the creation of many outstanding products. This led to a change in culture towards a more corporate norm. The author compares this situation to the tragedy portrayed in Fitzgerald's "Tender Is the Night," where a man's unfulfilled ambition drives him to drinking and divorce.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author describes their experience joining a company in 2017, comparing it to arriving late to a house party where the excitement had already died down. They mention that it was shortly after the company moved away from their motto "Don't be Evil". Despite meeting some amazing people, the overall organization felt similar to IBM but with better food. The author did not stay with the company for more than three years.

## 8. [Building a USB SNES Controller](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39054671)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 The author recounts their experience of purchasing an old SNES controller and wanting to modernize it so they could use it with their PC. They research the SNES controller hardware and find a document describing it. They then use a tiny board based on the ATmega32u4 chip to connect the SNES controller to their computer via USB. They code the button scanning process and use an Arduino HID Project library to program the Arduino as a HID gamepad. After testing and some modification to fit everything inside the controller, they successfully use the SNES controller to play Super Mario Kart on their PC.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes how controllers can be easy to work with and a good introduction to basic electronics hacking. The author shares their personal experience of using a Neo Geo arcade board with a "Supergun" board to play it on an RGB monitor. They did not have a controller for it, so they purchased a USB controller accessory designed for the Neo Geo X system. They then modified the controller by desoldering the button-to-USB connections inside and connecting them directly to a Neo Geo controller cable, which successfully allowed them to use the controller with their setup.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the SNES controller uses a 16-bit shift register and the timing for polling it is likely loose. It also mentions that polling it at the required frequency for serious gaming is possible and it can be easily read using the MCU's SPI peripheral.
