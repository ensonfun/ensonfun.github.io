## 4. [LG and Samsung are making TV screens disappear](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41104615)

**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

 The article discusses the demonstration of see-through TVs by LG and Samsung at CES 2024. While these transparent TVs garnered attention and admiration, they are not expected to be available for consumers in the near future. LG is relying on OLED displays, while Samsung is opting for microLED screens. However, both technologies are still in development and face challenges. OLED displays work by using organic light-emitting diode materials that emit light when energized. These materials are deposited as thin films to create full-color images. Transparent conductive traces and small transistors are used to ensure transparency, but an encapsulating layer is needed to protect the display. Samsung, on the other hand, is using inorganic LEDs in their transparent displays. Each pixel contains three LEDs for red, green, and blue colors. LED displays are already present in various applications such as lightbulbs and electronic devices. However, both LG and Samsung's transparent displays still block some light and are not as transparent as window glass.

## 6. [A Visual Guide to LLM Quantization](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41105881)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of running Large Language Models (LLMs) on consumer hardware due to their large size. To address this issue, researchers have been focused on making these models smaller through techniques like quantization. Quantization involves reducing the precision of a model's parameters from higher bit-widths to lower bit-widths. This reduction in precision may lead to a loss of granularity, similar to using fewer colors to represent an image. The goal is to minimize the number of bits needed to represent the model's parameters while preserving accuracy. The article explores different data types, such as FP16 and BF16, and their impact on the range of values that can be represented. It also discusses quantization techniques like post-training quantization and quantization-aware training. Overall, the aim is to make LLMs more efficient by reducing the space required to store values without sacrificing accuracy.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the topic of quantization. It mentions that GPTQ (Generalized Product Quantization) uses asymmetric quantization, with each layer being processed independently before moving on to the next. However, there is a bug in popular implementations of GPTQ where all zero/bias values are reset to 1 during packing, resulting in a significant loss in quality. It is noted that symmetric quantization initially appeared to work better than asymmetric quantization, which was counter-intuitive. The bug was later discovered as the reason behind this observation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary
