## 1. [The tiny corp raised $5.1M](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36065175)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The author has started a new company that aims to commoditize "the petaflop" by building an open-source framework, runtime, and driver for AMD chips. The company's short-term goal is to get AMD on MLPerf using their tinygrad framework. They believe that starting an AI chip company requires starting with the software and that the computing in ML is not general-purpose computing. The article outlines the advantages of their tinygrad IR, which has 12 operations, all of which are ADD/MUL only. The author expresses a desire for an open-source framework that can run cutting edge AI on any chip as seamlessly as Linux supports 50 network cards.

 George Hotz, a well-known hacker, has announced a new project called "PicoCUDA" as his latest technology endeavor. Hotz has previously created knockoff versions of popular technology, gained media fame, but then failed to deliver due to a lack of resources or focus. However, PicoCUDA aims to be an alternative to CUDA/NVIDIA, a widely-used parallel computing platform and API, which could potentially break Hotz's pattern of fizzled-out projects. Despite this, individuals are advised to be cautious before giving Hotz a deposit.

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 SectorC is a C compiler written in x86-16 assembly that fits within the 512 byte boot sector of an x86 machine. It is capable of supporting a subset of C that is large enough to write real and interesting programs. The article describes the author's journey in developing SectorC, including overcoming the challenges of fitting a C tokenizer/lexer within the limited memory space and developing a Barely C Programming Language that minimizes the number of tokens. Ultimately, the author was able to create a proper C compiler with spare memory to include additional features. The article also discusses the lack of error checking in traditional C programming and provides examples of programs leveraging the unique hardware aspects of the x86-16 IBM PC.

## 7. [VanJS (Vanilla JavaScript): smallest reactive UI framework](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36067983)

**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

 VanJS is a reactive UI framework based on pure vanilla JavaScript and DOM that helps manage state and UI binding with a simple API, offering every good aspect that React does without the need of React, JSX, transpiling, or any hidden logic. The framework is very thin and delegates most of the work to standard browser APIs implemented in native code, resulting in a small bundled size of just 1.2 kB. VanJS provides first-class support for TypeScript and puts heavy emphasis on simplicity, with only 4 exported functions in the API. The goal of VanJS is to reduce the entry barrier for UI programming and build a better world, with no intention or plan for commercialization.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that using "VanJS" as an abbreviation for "Vanilla JavaScript" could cause confusion as the term already exists to refer to JavaScript without any framework. The author suggests using alternative puns such adding a scoop of vanilla to your project or sprinkling in some Reactive syntax instead.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes a DSL for manipulating the document object model (DOM) on webpages, and a system that replaces the DOM from scratch each time data changes. This approach is criticized for being bad for performance and accessibility, as it involves recomputing style and requiring repaints even for minor changes. The author suggests that the supposed benefit of smaller bundle sizes does not outweigh the drawbacks of abandoning rendering engine computations.

## 8. [Tape Storage Trundles On, Increases Yearly Volume to 128 Exabytes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36056408)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 Despite frequently being declared "dead", tape storage has seen a prolonged increase in shipments recently, with a 5% YoY increase from the Linear Tape-Open Program Group which includes IBM, Quantum Corporation and HPE. The latest technology, LTO-9, has greatly increased compressed data density up to 45TB and increased transfer rates of up to 900 MB/s. Shipping volumes of tape storage, in general, have seen a decline but recent increases suggest that as a long-term storage solution, tape still has many benefits.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author's dissertation research from 1980 on Jupiter's upper atmosphere is stored on a 2400 foot reel of tape in their attic. The data is approximately 40 megabytes, but the author has no plans to try to rebuild the scattering matrix for Jovian cloud particles.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The use of tape for backup has been declared as dying by those who do not use or understand the differences between tape and disk. However, the assertion that drives do not fail often enough to justify the use of tape is incorrect. In order to be safe, data should be on at least two drives, which increases the cost. The use of older LTO drives and tapes is both easy and cost-effective for backing up data.

## 10. [Archive of medieval books and manuscripts discovered in Romanian church](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36069393)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 A team of researchers from Babeș-Bolyai University have discovered over 200 books and manuscripts dating as early as the ninth century in a church tower in Mediaș, central Romania. Among them are 139 printed books from between 1470 and 1600, two manuscripts from the 16th century and around 60 charters, records and documents between the 14th and 16th centuries. Furthermore, there were manuscripts retained inside parish records, the oldest of which was from the Caroliginian period and may date to the ninth century. St Margaret’s Church, or Margarethenkirche, was founded by Transylvanian Saxons in the 15th century and the collection seems to have been left inside the church's tower for at least decades, possibly for protection during WW1 or WW2. The team will now match up the books with those listed in a catalogue from 1864, which contained around 7,700 volumes.
