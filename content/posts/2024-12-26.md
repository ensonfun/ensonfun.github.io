## 2. [Seconds Since the Epoch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42512371)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article discusses common misconceptions about POSIX time, which is often mistakenly described as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC). Here are the key points:

1. **Definition and Misconception**: POSIX time isn't strictly the count of seconds since the epoch due to the inclusion of leap seconds, which are added to keep Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) aligned with solar time. This results in a discrepancy between the actual number of seconds and what POSIX time represents.

2. **Leap Seconds**: To maintain the accuracy of UTC, leap seconds are occasionally added. This causes POSIX time to jump backwards or potentially forward, leading to complications in systems expecting a continuous increase in time values.

3. **IEEE Standard**: The IEEE 1003.1 standard defines POSIX time in a way that assumes every day has exactly 86,400 seconds, ignoring leap seconds for simplicity, which leads to a divergence from actual time.

4. **Practical Implications**: The standard admits that systems do not track leap seconds accurately, and it suggests that vendors and system administrators should ensure time accuracy "as closely as necessary" for their applications. However, this is challenging due to the unpredictability and rarity of leap seconds.

5. **System Time Handling**: For applications needing precise time calculations within a single system, using alternatives like `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` is recommended. For systems requiring time synchronization with others using POSIX time, considerations like time smearing might be necessary to handle the discrepancies caused by leap seconds.

6. **Future Concerns**: The article notes that while time synchronization issues are generally overlooked, the rare occurrence of leap seconds can lead to significant software bugs or system failures, highlighting the need for better time management in distributed systems. 

The discussion emphasizes the inherent complexities and potential pitfalls in using POSIX time, especially in applications requiring high precision and synchronization across different systems.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a proposal to eliminate leap seconds from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by 2035. The author expresses disapproval of this plan, arguing that the essence of UTC is to maintain synchronization with mean solar time (MST) through adjustments like leap seconds. If the tracking of MST is no longer a priority, the author suggests switching entirely to International Atomic Time (TAI), rather than letting UTC drift away from MST, which would leave UTC in a confusing state with historical but now purposeless leap seconds.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 "A Deepness in the Sky" by Vernor Vinge, published in 2000, features a unique timekeeping system used by the Traders. They measure time from the moment humans first stepped on the moon, but more precisely, their system starts from the zero-second of one of the earliest computer operating systems, roughly 15 million seconds after the moon landing. This method involves complex frame corrections and a continuous counter.

## 3. [Reads Causing Writes in Postgres](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42485505)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses how to monitor SQL statements in PostgreSQL, focusing on the `pg_stat_statements` view which tracks statistics like `shared_blks_dirtied` and `shared_blks_written`. These statistics show how many blocks in the shared buffer cache are modified or written to disk by SQL queries, including seemingly read-only SELECT statements due to mechanisms like:

1. **Setting Hint Bits**: This mechanism helps track the state of transactions, marking rows as visible to all transactions once certain conditions are met.

2. **Page Pruning**: This involves removing old row versions no longer needed, which can also trigger writes.

The article explains:

- **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)**: PostgreSQL uses this to manage concurrent access to data, allowing different clients to see different versions of the same row depending on their transaction isolation levels. This can lead to phenomena like non-repeatable reads.

- **Data Organization in Postgres**: 
  - Data is stored in files divided into blocks or pages, each typically 8192 bytes.
  - Pages contain heap tuples (row versions).
  - The table's data structure includes a main fork for data, a free space map, and a visibility map.

The explanation includes a simplified example of a `books` table to illustrate how data is physically stored and managed in PostgreSQL, emphasizing the concepts of pages, blocks, and tuples.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of understanding and troubleshooting PostgreSQL (referred to as "postgres") when issues arise. It suggests that typically, one only delves into the workings of such a complex database system when something malfunctions, leading to feelings of nervousness, panic, and often confusion due to its counterintuitive behaviors. This experience, the author implies, might be common when dealing with any large, complex system.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that in PostgreSQL, the default setting for `work_mem` is 4MB. This means that if operations like `ORDER BY` generate large intermediate results, these results will spill over to disk due to insufficient memory allocation, potentially slowing down query performance.

## 6. [I thought I found a bug](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42510776)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses a bug encountered while improving a DOS emulator, specifically with how COMMAND.COM handles file operations. The issue was related to the file I/O operations in C, where:

1. **Initial Problem**: When COMMAND.COM attempted to write specific data to a file, it resulted in unexpected output due to its handling of potential Ctrl-Z characters at the end of files.

2. **Debugging**: Using a debugger, the author identified issues with how the C runtime libraries (Open Watcom, Microsoft Visual C++, IBM C/C++) managed file writes, particularly with the sequence of read and write operations.

3. **Behavioral Inconsistencies**: Different compilers exhibited different behaviors when writing data. For instance, some wrote partial data or set error flags in non-intuitive ways, with errors like EPUTANDGET in IBM's runtime.

4. **Historical Context**: The behavior stems from early C implementations where file modes were strictly for reading, writing, or appending, without an update mode that allowed mixed operations. This led to current standards requiring explicit flushing or repositioning when switching between reading and writing.

5. **Standards Evolution**: Over time, C standards have evolved to clarify that switching from output to input or vice versa without proper file positioning or flushing operations can lead to unpredictable results, although the core issue has remained essentially unchanged since the 1970s.

6. **Conclusion**: The complexity and historical baggage of C's file I/O operations mean that developers must be cautious with file handling, especially when mixing read and write operations in update mode. The article highlights the need for understanding these nuances to avoid subtle bugs in file operations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's discovery of an old document, the **usr/group Standard**, which they mention they possess in a digital format from an early DOS hard drive image. This document was from before the author switched to Linux in 1991. They express an intention to share this document online. Additionally, the author includes an output of a directory listing command (`ls -altr`) showing files like NOTES, LIB, APP, and C, which were last modified in April 1990, suggesting these files are from the same era as the mentioned standard.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses issues with stdio implementations where reading and writing operations cannot be freely mixed due to the use of a single buffer for both operations. Here are the key points:

1. **Single Buffer Issue**: Many stdio implementations use one buffer for both reading and writing. Switching between these operations requires clearing or resetting the buffer because the buffer might contain outdated or irrelevant data.

2. **Functions to Reset Buffer**: Functions like `fflush()`, `fseek()`, `rewind()`, and `fsetpos()` are used to clear the buffer, making it safe to switch from reading to writing or vice versa.

3. **Lack of Operation Indicators**: There's typically no indicator in the `struct FILE` to show whether the last operation was a read or write, which complicates automatic management of buffer states.

4. **Potential Solutions**: 
   - **Dual Buffers**: An alternative would be to use separate buffers for reading and writing, but this wasn't initially implemented.
   - **Documentation Over Fix**: The problem was likely documented instead of fixed, possibly due to the complexity of retrofitting such changes into existing systems.

The article suggests that the initial implementation did not account for easy switching between read and write modes, and rather than redesigning the system with dual buffers or automatic flushing, maintainers chose to document the limitation.
