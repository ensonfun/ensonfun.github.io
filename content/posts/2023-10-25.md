## 1. [Embeddings: What they are and why they matter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37985489)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 This article introduces embeddings, which are arrays of floating-point numbers that represent the semantic meaning of content. The length of the array remains constant regardless of the length of the content. Embeddings capture characteristics of the content and can be used for various purposes such as finding related articles or performing semantic searches. The author gives examples of how they used embeddings to build a "related content" feature for their blog and a search engine for code. They also discuss powerful models like Word2Vec, CLIP, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which utilize embeddings for tasks like text-image similarity and question-answering. The article highlights the importance of using openly licensed models and provides practical examples and tools for working with embeddings.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article provides additional resources for understanding text embeddings at a deeper level. It mentions Cohere's Text Embeddings Visually Explained, the Tensorflow Embedding Projector tool, and Vicki Boykis' article on embeddings. These resources are recommended for further reading on the topic.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of embeddings in computer vision and visual SLAM algorithms for place recognition. The core idea is to pass each image through a feature-extractor-descriptor pipeline, resulting in a vector representation containing the top features. This vector representation is used to create a database of images called keyframes. While the camera moves, the images are queried against the database using cosine similarity to find the best match. If a match is found, stereo-constraints can be computed between the query image and the match to update the map. The article provides links to the original paper and a popular implementation of the method.

 I apologize, but as an AI text-based assistant, I am unable to access or click on links. However, if you provide me with the text from the article, I would be more than happy to help you summarize it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Calvin and Hobbes is considered magnificent for several reasons. Firstly, the comic strip was never licensed, which is the second remarkable aspect. Furthermore, Calvin and Hobbes ended at the height of its greatness instead of being stretched out for profit. This means there are no movies, sequels, licensed merchandise, or live-action adaptations available. Calvin and Hobbes is not featured on MacDonalds cups or seen as giant balloon figures in parades. The article suggests imagining if Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit had been similarly preserved.

## 5. [Judas goat](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38007906)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 A Judas goat is a trained goat that is used in animal herding to lead sheep or cattle to a specific destination. It is called a Judas goat because it leads the animals to slaughter while its own life is spared. This technique originated from cattle drives in the United States in the 1800s. Judas goats have also been utilized to find feral goats and other invasive species in order to exterminate them. In recent times, they have been used in conservation projects to restore natural ecosystems. The article mentions specific examples of eradicating feral goats on San Clemente Island and in the Galápagos Islands. These projects involved using Judas goats to lead the remaining goats to their death.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the common experience of large, bearded men being met with shyness or fear from small children. It suggests that this reaction is based on real-life experiences and the stereotype of a small child hiding behind their mother's legs. However, the article also notes that this behavior often changes when the same man is accompanied by his own child, as children have a deep-rooted instinct that tells them a father cannot be a bad person.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that instead of emphasizing driverless cars, the focus should be on public transportation, which is already "driverless" for many people except for a few drivers per thousand passengers. The author argues that the purpose of driverless cars is to provide seamless connectivity without the hassle of driving. The author personally relies on public transportation and walking to reach their destination, stating that they do not own a car and have no intention to do so.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article raises concerns about the operational constraints of self-driving cars. The author suggests that a fair comparison should be made between self-driving cars and human drivers under similar conditions, roads, and weather. The existence of a support team and standby remote operators is also mentioned, noting that the financial implications of these resources are unknown. The article questions the sustainability of self-driving car services if they end up costing more than traditional ridesharing options like Uber.

## 9. [Not knowing the /proc file system](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38009372)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience working with files and file systems on Linux. They wanted to practice coding against the Linux API and decided to work on a small project that involved listing all processes running on the system associated with a specific user. They used the /proc file system to gather information about the processes. The author initially wrote a Python script using the os module and pathlib.Path class to list the pids and program names of the processes. They then analyzed the system calls used by the script and compared it to a C version of the program. The C version had fewer system calls and no virtual machine overhead. The author also noted some differences in the file descriptor handling and the use of ioctl and lseek operations between the two versions. They shared the code for the C version and mentioned using external resources for learning C programming. The author then compared the performance of the Python and C versions using a benchmarking tool called hyperfine. They concluded that the Python interpreter had significant overhead compared to the C program.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the problems with the Linux "/proc" file system and its impact on kernel to user space communication. It explains that "/proc" is a system call with a fake file system API, causing issues such as unreliable code and race conditions when reading files. It also highlights the lack of a standard mechanism for delivering variable-sized results from a system call in the Linux kernel. The article provides a link for further information on the topic.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the presence of an ioctl call in a program and addresses it causing an error. The ioctl call is used to perform a terminal control operation. The article explains that the error from the ioctl call is expected and handled by the code. The reason for the ioctl call is related to the buffering policy of the open function. The default buffering policy depends on the type of file being opened. In this case, the file is not opened in binary mode, so the policy for other text files applies. The ioctl syscall is used to determine if the opened file is a TTY or not. Since the file is not a TTY, the ioctl returns an error, but the code interprets it as meaning "no, that isn't a TTY."

## 10. [MAME 0.260](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38008461)

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an old frontend for MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) written in Python 2 and Pygame. The frontend, called PyRetro, was created to be used in public spaces, such as social centers, and is specifically designed to prevent unauthorized changes to the frontend's configuration and allow for remote management through a web panel. It also includes a screensaver mode when the arcade cabinet is not being used. The author mentions that the frontend needs updating to Python 3 and Pygame 3.

### Top 2 Comment Summary
