## 4. [Anything longer ago than yesterday should just say the actual date](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37880818)

**Total comment counts : 65**

### Summary

 The author of the article argues that labels such as "yesterday," "2 days ago," and "a week ago" used in computer interfaces do not accurately reflect how humans think about time. While humans consider "yesterday" to mean the day before, from midnight to midnight, computers define it as less than 24 hours ago. Additionally, different computer systems may interpret these labels differently, leading to a lack of trust and usefulness. The author also criticizes the use of labels like "12 days ago," stating that humans do not think in terms of "5+ days ago." Instead, they suggest using specific day references rather than vague time periods like "last week/month/year."

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the time frame "1 year ago" on YouTube can be misleading because it can represent anywhere from 365 to 729 days. This means that if there are two videos uploaded "a year ago," it is impossible to determine which one is more recent without actually opening the videos and checking the date in the description.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is expressing frustration with the lack of specific timestamps provided when browsing npm versions of packages. They are trying to figure out the release order of older packages to create a build configuration. The author criticizes the inconvenience of having to check each package individually to determine if it is too recent to use. They also mention their dissatisfaction with ORM builders that map table names incorrectly.

## 7. [Implementing a GPU's programming model on a CPU](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37874423)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 This article discusses the programming model of a GPU, specifically focusing on the concept of "single instruction multiple thread" (SIMT). The author explains that programmers write their programs from the perspective of a single thread, but the system runs the program in parallel with different thread IDs. GPUs optimize this process by using vector registers and instructions to run multiple threads simultaneously, improving performance. The article also explains how SIMT handles control flow using predicated instructions and bitmask registers. The author then describes their implementation of SIMT transformation using the AVX-512 instruction set, providing insights into how real GPU compilers work. The article also touches on topics such as variables, literal math, pointers, and function pointers in SIMT. The author emphasizes that their implementation is for learning purposes and not focused on achieving maximum performance. The article concludes by mentioning that the programming language the author implemented supports control flow and provides a link to the author's implementation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article describes their experience creating a modified version of the RISC-V architecture for a class project. They explain that they compiled programs to WebAssembly (WASM) using clang, then converted the resulting WASM back to C, but this time using RISC-V vector intrinsics for all opcodes. They found this approach to be a clever solution, as WASM's structured control flow aligns well with lane masking, stack and local values can easily utilize a "structure of arrays" layout, and heap values can easily use an "array of structures" layout. Although the project did not gain much traction, the code is still available online for those interested.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses various implementations of graphics processing units (GPUs) and their capabilities. It mentions ISPC, SwiftShader, Lavapipe, and WARP as examples of software fallback implementations of GPU APIs. The author expresses disappointment that Larrabee, a parallel computer with GPU-like efficiency and CPU-like agility, did not gain popularity due to power consumption issues. The article includes a link for more information on WARP.

## 10. [Daily energy expenditure through the human life course](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37878558)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses the trajectory of total daily energy expenditure (total expenditure) throughout the human life course. The researchers analyzed a large database of total expenditure measured using the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years. They found that total expenditure increases with fat-free mass in a power-law manner and identified four distinct life stages. Total expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates, declines slowly and reaches adult levels by around 20 years of age, remains stable in adulthood (20 to 60 years) including during pregnancy, and then declines in older adults. These findings provide insights into human development and aging and can help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author shares their personal experience of having a high metabolism and being able to eat unhealthy foods without gaining weight as a teenager and in university. They mention consuming chocolate bars, carbs, and alcohol regularly. Despite this, they were thin and had low body fat. However, around the age of 25, this changed, and they had to start watching what they ate to avoid gaining weight. The author wonders what could explain this shift in their metabolism and ability to gain weight.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article explains that muscle burns more energy than fat. As individuals get older and their muscle mass decreases due to lack of exercise, it is common for their metabolism to decline. This decline happens even if the "metabolism per kg of muscle" remains unchanged.
