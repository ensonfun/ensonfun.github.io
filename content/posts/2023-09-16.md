**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Subdomain Center uses a combination of tools, including Apache's Nutch, Calidog's Certstream, OpenAI's Embedding Models, and some proprietary tools, to identify more subdomains than any other service. The service has implemented a rate limit of 3 requests per minute to prevent abuse, but they apologize for any downtime or delays that may occur. They humorously mention that their servers are sometimes overwhelmed by both demanding users and a less powerful infrastructure. The service is also referred to as a command-line utility.

 The article explains that it is no longer possible to hide anything on the internet because regular scans of the full IPv4 range are conducted by various entities. If a port is opened on a public IP, it will be found, especially if it is on a standard port. The author emphasizes that many people are still unaware of this fact and may inadvertently expose services without authentication on public IPs. The article also mentions Certificate Transparency logs, which make it impossible to hide an HTTPS service without a wildcard certificate. The author recommends using tools like crt.sh, subdomain.center, hackertarget.com, and Detectify to find exposed subdomains, and suggests using a brute-force tool like Sublist3r to complement the search.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article claims that it is not possible for a website to gather information on "all subdomains" unless it is performing a specific action. The article suggests that the website may be a scraper or guesser that uses methods such as certificate transparency and common names to gather information. However, the article concludes that these claims are false.

 The article states that prices in supermarkets are significantly higher in Austria compared to Germany. The author provides several reasons for this, including less price sensitivity among Austrian consumers, higher logistics costs due to lower population density and difficult-to-reach locations, slightly higher VAT in Austria, higher wages for supermarket and logistics workers in Austria compared to Germany, and a higher density of supermarkets in Austria. The author argues that consumer choices and preferences play a significant role in the higher prices, suggesting that if Austrians were more price-conscious like Germans, prices would decrease.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that using PVC water pipes in your house is generally not allowed according to plumbing codes. This is because PVC loses strength at higher temperatures, making it unsuitable for household hot water. Manufacturers do not rate PVC pipes for temperatures above 140 degrees F. CPVC, on the other hand, has better hot water performance and can be easily found. It can also be glued like PVC if the right glue is used. However, CPVC pipes are usually sold in "copper tube size" instead of Schedule 40/80, but this allows many push-to-connect fittings to work with CPVC pipes.

## 6. [The first week of US v. Google – Defaults are everything and nobody likes Bing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37528453)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The US Justice Department has launched a major antitrust trial against Google, alleging that the company used anti-competitive tactics to maintain its dominant position in the search engine market. The government argues that Google's success is not simply due to a good design, but to coercive deals that have stifled competition. The trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks, began quietly with a small crowd in the courtroom. The case focuses on Google's use of default search deals and the vast amount of search data it collects to improve its engine, creating a feedback loop that makes it difficult for competitors to catch up. The Justice Department is drawing parallels to the antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, but Google argues that the situations are different and that it is facing punishment for its success. The trial will determine whether Google's actions benefit consumers or hinder competition.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article expresses disappointment with the focus on defaults in relation to Microsoft's conglomerated system. It argues that the tying of various parts of the system makes it difficult for smaller corporations to compete. The capturing of the search default on Android is seen as a minor aspect of their overall strategy, and the article suggests that Google could pay for the default or allow users to choose, which would have minimal impact on the search market. The article also mentions the question of whether consumer harm applies to free products like search engines.

## 8. [Horcrux: Split your file into encrypted fragments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37534615)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The article discusses a tool called "horcrux" that allows users to split a file into encrypted fragments, similar to the concept of horcruxes in the Harry Potter universe. The tool has two commands: "split" and "bind". By using the "split" command, users can choose the number of horcruxes they want and the number required to resurrect the original file. The horcrux files can then be dispersed in various locations. The "bind" command is used to combine the horcruxes back into the original file. The tool utilizes the Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme to break an encryption key into parts that can be recombined using a certain threshold. It is based on Hashicorp's implementation from their vault repository.
