## 6. [Visual calculus](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39353207)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses visual calculus, an approach to solving integral calculus problems that was invented by Mamikon Mnatsakanian. Mamikon devised his method in 1959 while an undergraduate and first applied it to find the area of a ring (annulus) given the length of a chord tangent to the inner circumference. His method involves an alternate construction of the ring using constant-length tangents that are translated so their points of tangency coincide. This results in a circular disk of known radius and easily computed area. Mamikon's theorem states that the area of a cycloid can be calculated by considering the area between it and an enclosing rectangle. The article explains how the tangents used to generate the cycloid can be clustered together to form a circle. The area of the cycloid is then found to be three times the area of the generating circle.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the need for caution when using visual proofs. It highlights the example of the "missing square puzzle" to illustrate that just because something looks right visually, it doesn't necessarily mean it is correct. The article also mentions other examples such as curves that appear to change direction or converge but actually do not, as well as situations where something looks continuous but is undefined at a specific point. The article suggests that visual proofs can be helpful in understanding concepts and considering potential solutions, but they should not replace the need to do the actual mathematical calculations and derivations to verify their validity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that many difficult problems can be solved using a certain method, even without extensive calculations. However, it is criticized for lacking specificity, lacking credible sources, being overly descriptive and subjective in its language.

### Summary

 Researchers have discovered a stone age wall off the coast of Germany's Baltic coast, which may be the oldest known megastructure built by humans in Europe. The wall stretches for nearly a kilometer and consists of smaller stones connecting larger boulders. It was likely constructed over 10,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers and may have served as a driving lane for hunting herds of reindeer. The wall's stones are estimated to weigh more than 142 tonnes. The site is submerged in water and was likely submerged 8,500 years ago due to rising sea levels. Researchers plan to revisit the site to further investigate the purpose of the wall and search for artifacts.
