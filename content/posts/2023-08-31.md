**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

The author acknowledges that the software is free and they have no right to expect anything, but they had hoped to replace commercial virtual machine solutions with an open-source alternative, which they were unable to do in this case.

**Total comment counts : 69**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Instagram has evolved from a platform for sharing everyday photos to a curated platform where even authentic content is meticulously planned. This shift has led to fatigue among average users, who now prefer sharing content in private or closed groups.

Despite efforts by various apps to capture the essence of early social media, such as BeReal, Dispo, Poparazzi, and Locket, none have been able to truly succeed. The rise of private messaging apps like Discord and community-based platforms like Geneva has provided users with more direct and niche connections. The article concludes by stating that people are becoming more selective with their communities and reverting to an old-school way of interacting, marking the end of the Instagram era and the emergence of a new era of "authentic" online sharing.
