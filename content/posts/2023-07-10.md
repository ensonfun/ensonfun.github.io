### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article explains that an 18-year-old student with no money or credit history can receive a loan backed by the federal government if they get accepted into a qualifying university. This has led to an increase in tuition and fees, as universities are confident that their admitted students will be able to pay.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article argues that the current system of student loans benefits lenders and colleges because the government guarantees the loans and protects them from bankruptcy. The author suggests that removing this "free money guarantee" would force lenders to be more selective, as they would have to use the same criteria as issuing credit cards to younger individuals with no credit history. The author also believes that colleges would have to reconsider raising costs if lenders become more strict or stop lending altogether.

## 8. [Wayland on OpenBSD](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36659859)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experiment with building Wayland on OpenBSD during the g2k23 event in Tallinn. The author acknowledges that there are still many issues to be resolved, but it demonstrates that running Wayland on OpenBSD is possible. The author provides build instructions and notes that scdoc is used to generate manual pages. They also mention patches and ports for various components of Wayland on OpenBSD. The author highlights the need to install certain packages for cursors and fonts to work correctly. They mention that some applications still rely on Xwayland and there are issues with GTK+ and Qt support. Finally, the author notes that there is no implementation of UTF-32 support on OpenBSD and mentions future improvements that could be made, such as sandboxing and crash debugging.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author questions the feasibility of emulating or supporting libevdev and libinput on non-Linux operating systems. They suggest that the Wayland protocol does not necessarily require these implementations, and that alternative approaches specific to each operating system may be more beneficial for the ecosystem. Additionally, the author expresses skepticism regarding the concept of multiple seats in OpenBSD and suggests that compositors should instead have a mode where a single seat owns all input and display devices.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author has been interested in using OpenBSD on their desktop but has been deterred by issues with X server. However, they are hopeful that a new development might finally allow them to switch to OpenBSD.

## 9. [3M reaches $10.3B settlement over PFAS contamination of water systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36660751)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 Chemical manufacturer 3M has agreed to pay at least $10.3 billion to settle lawsuits over the contamination of U.S. public drinking water systems with PFAS, a potentially harmful compound. PFAS, commonly used in firefighting foam and other consumer products, have been linked to various health issues. The settlement will help cover the costs of filtering PFAS from affected water systems and testing others. The agreement is subject to court approval and may reach as high as $12.5 billion, depending on further testing. 3M plans to halt all PFAS production by the end of 2025.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author's initial reaction to something is "That's it?" They suggest that maybe the mentioned amount is per year and paid by all former executives from when PFAS were manufactured. The author believes that since the executives take credit and receive bonuses for positive things, they should also be accountable for the negative aspects.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that 3M has stated that its participation in a settlement is not an admission of liability. The writer finds such statements amusing and suggests the implementation of a policy to prevent post-settlement spinning.

## 10. [Mistakes with Rust smart pointers: when Deref goes wrong](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36662385)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses the implementation of the `Deref` trait on custom types, specifically focusing on the use of `Deref` with ASCII strings. The author explains the motivation behind using a newtype to wrap a `Vec<u8>` to represent ASCII strings and how the `Deref` trait allows for automatic coercion from `&Vec<u8>` to `&[u8]`. The author also explores the confusion that arises when `Deref` affects the behavior of implementing the `Index` trait on `&str`. The article concludes with a cautionary note about the implications of implementing `Deref` and the importance of ensuring all implementations of a specific trait.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the use of smart pointers in Rust and potential conflicts that can arise when using them. The author explains that true smart pointers should not have methods of their own, but rather rely on functions that can be called on the pointer itself. This helps to avoid conflicts. The author also mentions that using the Deref trait for types like String or Vec can lead to conflicts, as Rust does not have method overloading. They suggest that using Deref can be useful for creating is-a relationships or delegating functionality to another type.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses an issue with method search in Rust, where it does not check method parameter types against argument types. The author explains that Rust does not allow much overloading of function names, partly because C++ had complex overload resolution rules that could introduce errors. In Rust, the programmer is required to write out the rules explicitly, which may be more verbose but less confusing.
