## 3. [CFPB Takes Action Against Coding Boot Camp BloomTech and CEO Austen Allred](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40067939)

**Total comment counts : 61**

### Summary

 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has issued an order against BloomTech, a for-profit school, and its CEO, Austen Allred, for deceiving students about the cost of loans and falsely claiming high job-placement rates. The CFPB found that BloomTech falsely marketed its "income share" agreement contracts as not being loans, when in reality they carried substantial finance charges. Internal metrics showed that placement rates were closer to 50 percent, despite the company's claims of rates as high as 86 percent. As a result, BloomTech is permanently banned from consumer-lending activities, and Allred is banned from student-lending activities for ten years. Other penalties include ceasing collections on loans for graduates without a qualifying job and allowing students to withdraw without penalty. BloomTech and Allred must also pay civil penalties of over $164,000.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author attended Lambda School and initially believed they would only have to pay if they got a job using the skills learned. However, the experience quickly deteriorated as the format and curriculum constantly changed, making it difficult for the author to complete the program due to their work schedule. Promised career guidance never materialized, with the closest thing being an irrelevant resume course and review by another student. When the author dropped out, they sought to have the Income Share Agreement (ISA) canceled or reduced, but Lambda School insisted they were still responsible for it. The author considered legal action but was discouraged due to the required arbitration in NYC being more costly than potential savings.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article recalls growing up in the Soviet Union and having access to books that were not available to the general public. One of these books discussed the European Information System for the Coordination of Information on Agro- and Fishery Science and Technology (EURISCO) and its advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). The book claimed that EURISCO not only won games but also invented a new structure of a NAND-gate in silicon, which is now used by the industry. Another expert system mentioned in the book claimed to be twice as effective as the best human diagnostician in diagnosing cancer. However, despite these impressive capabilities, the author wonders why these systems were not widely deployed in hospitals, particularly in the United States. The author notes that current language and image models, such as LLMs, are limited to predicting words and pixels rather than understanding and diagnosing the real world. The author questions why there has been progress in text and image generation but not in the development of diagnostic systems, except for Cyc. The article concludes with the author pondering what might have happened to hinder the advancement of world models in AI.

## 6. [Goldene: A single atom layer of gold](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40071956)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 Scientists from Linköping University in Sweden have successfully created sheets of gold that are only a single atom layer thick, a material they term "goldene". This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for using gold in applications such as carbon dioxide conversion, hydrogen production, and the production of value-added chemicals. The researchers used a three-dimensional base material with gold embedded between layers of titanium and carbon to create goldene. The discovery was made accidentally when the researchers exposed the material to high temperatures, causing the gold to replace the silicon layer inside the base material. Using a method called Murakami's reagent, which has been used in Japanese forging art for over a hundred years, the researchers were able to separate and stabilize the gold sheets. Goldene has unique properties as a result of being two-dimensional, such as having two free bonds, which make it suitable for various future applications. The researchers plan to investigate whether the same process can be applied to other noble metals and explore additional applications. The research was funded by various organizations and foundations, including the Swedish Research Council and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the genetic mysteries surrounding skin appendages in humans, specifically focusing on how nails and hairs grow in only one direction. The author mentions a side point about the microraptor, a quadrupedal creature with four wings. Unlike insects, the microraptor used all four limbs to fly. However, it is suggested that sticking to two wings was more optimal due to the optimization of the wishbone and chest musculature. The article notes that the Wikipedia page on the microraptor does not explore this idea.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In October 2022, a bird known as B6, a young Bar-tailed Godwit, set a new world record by flying from Alaska to Tasmania without taking a break. The bird covered a distance of 8,425 miles over 11 days. The article highlights various factors that contributed to this achievement, such as muscle power, metabolic rate, and a physiological tolerance for elevated cortisol levels. Additionally, a fun fact not mentioned in the article is that birds sleep with only half of their brain at a time during these long flights, allowing them to stay alert and avoid falling out of the sky.

## 8. [Implementing Natural Conversational Agents with Elixir](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40071843)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's work on building an assistant named Nero using AI, math, and programming. The initial version of Nero was not a great conversational assistant as it required user interaction and did not retain conversational history. The author was motivated to improve this after seeing a demo from Retell. The author decided to change the speech-to-text pipeline by monitoring microphone volume and triggering recordings when the volume reached a certain threshold. However, this approach had issues with natural dips in volume, so a timeout was introduced to stop recording after the volume was below a threshold for a certain amount of time. Despite some shortcomings, the author was able to passably detect a single speaker in a quiet room.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is recommending a book called "Machine Learning in Elixir" by Seam Moriarity, which highlights the advancements of Elixir in the field of machine learning. The book is praised for its straightforward language and abundance of examples. A link to the book is provided for further information.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience in building a real-time conversation platform using Elixir. They used the Membrane framework to coordinate the steps involved in speech-to-text (STT), natural language processing (LLM), and text-to-speech (TTS), resulting in a latency of around 1300 ms. They found that the typical human response time in a conversation is around 250 to 300 ms and aimed to achieve that as their goal. 

To reduce latency, the author implemented several strategies: 
1. They streamed the audio to the TTS endpoint, focusing on the tail latency, which is the time between when the audio ends and the final transcript arrives. This approach significantly helped in reducing latency, with Google achieving around 200 ms in this aspect.
2. Gpt 3.5 had a time to first token of about 350 to 400 ms, which couldn't be improved further. However, streaming the tokens to ElevenLabs allowed for faster audio retrieval, contributing to reduced latency.
3. The majority of the latency budget was consumed by ElevenLabs, even with their turbo model. By streaming words (rather than tokens) and using the "flush" function, latency was further improved.

The author's key finding was to mask the latency by immediately responding with filler audio. They also mentioned the importance of making the LLM aware of the filler audio text to ensure a natural continuation in the conversation.
