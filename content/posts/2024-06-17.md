## 1. [FTC sues Adobe for hiding fees and inhibiting cancellations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40707558)

**Total comment counts : 65**

### Summary

 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is taking action against software maker Adobe and two of its executives for deceptive business practices. The FTC alleges that Adobe hid the early termination fee for its subscription plan and made it difficult for consumers to cancel their subscriptions. The complaint states that Adobe pushed customers towards an annual paid monthly subscription plan without adequately disclosing the cancellation fee, which could cost hundreds of dollars. The FTC claims that Adobe's cancellation processes are designed to make it difficult for consumers to cancel, and that the company continues to steer customers towards the annual plan while obscuring the termination fee. The FTC is working to protect consumers from these illegal practices and will continue to take action against companies that engage in deceptive business practices.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article talks about the changing attitudes of Adobe, a software company, towards piracy and its users. Around 25 years ago, Adobe seemed to view the widespread piracy of their software as a positive thing because it meant people were familiar with it and would then purchase it for work use. However, their attitude apparently changed as they gained market dominance, and they began to aggressively pursue profits, alienating some users in the process. The author mentions using Lightroom as one of the last pay-once software titles from Adobe and expresses dislike for their current product offerings, except for Acrobat Reader. They also mention feeling glad when Adobe's attempted purchase of Figma failed.

 The article discusses the use of optogenetics in worms, specifically focusing on a 1 mm long worm with a fully characterized nervous system. The worm's nervous system consists of 302 neurons that have been mapped and named in great detail. Despite this knowledge, understanding how these neurons function remains a challenge. The researchers in the article express optogenetics proteins in different sets of neurons, including 8 neurons involved in chemotaxis (movement towards food). By shining light on the worm, all these neurons can be activated simultaneously, although this method lacks precise control. The author notes that using optogenetics in worms is significant due to their affordability and simplicity, which can be helpful in understanding complex systems.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a project where researchers used a worm and manipulated its genetic machinery to control certain neurons using a light-sensitive protein. They connected a camera and an unsupervised reinforcement learning algorithm, which learned to control the lights and guide the worm towards a goal, like food. The algorithm was successful in navigating obstacles and improving the worm's abilities while leaving other neurons unaffected.

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 This article discusses an unusual "hello, world" program in C that doesn't use any C standard library functions. Instead, it makes a system call directly using inline assembly. The program works on Linux x86-64, but may not work on other systems due to assembly's lack of portability. The program uses "syscall" assembly instructions to make the system call, specifying the system call number as 1 for the write function. The necessary arguments for the write system call are stored in registers rdi, rsi, and rdx. The article also mentions the use of "extended asm" to handle more complex assembly code.

### Top 1 Comment Summary
