**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 In September 1993, Cyan, Inc., a small company run by the Miller brothers, released their puzzle game, Myst, on the Apple Macintosh platform. Initially, they didn't expect much success and were living on a tight budget. However, Myst slowly became a mass-market hit, selling millions of copies and receiving numerous awards and accolades. Instead of retiring on their earnings, the Miller brothers decided to fund the sequel, Riven, on their own using royalties from Myst. They aimed to create a game that surpassed its predecessor, leading them to take their time in development. Cyan's status and success allowed them to upgrade their workspace and invest in high-end equipment. The completed headquarters resembled the virtual worlds of Myst and Riven.

## 5. [Transforming a QLC SSD into an SLC SSD](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40405578)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 This article discusses the process of transforming a QLC NAND SSD into an SLC SSD to improve durability and performance. The author provides step-by-step instructions using the Crucial BX500 SSD as an example. They caution that this procedure voids the warranty and erases all data on the SSD, so backup is necessary. The article also discusses the SSD controller, DRAM cache, and NAND flash used in the Crucial BX500. The author explains the software, MPTools, used for this project, which allows for modifications to the SSD settings. The article concludes by mentioning the need to retrieve certain parameters from the SSD before making modifications.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article explains how to use inexpensive DRAMless SSDs in pSLC (pseudo-single-level cell) mode without much difficulty. By under-provisioning the SSD to only use 25-33% of its capacity and leaving the remaining space unused and trimmed, the SSD will continuously write in pSLC mode. The article suggests checking the SSD's mode by conducting a "HD Tune" full drive write benchmark and observing if the write speed drops significantly after the first 1/3-1/4 of the drive, indicating full drive caching mode. Most low-end DRAMless controllers operate in this mode, although some manufacturers may have modified the firmware to use a smaller cache.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the relationship between endurance and retention in flash cells. It explains that flash cells wear out and become leakier with each cycle, causing them to lose their charge more quickly. It mentions that SLC (Single-Level Cell) mode, which only requires distinguishing between two states, allows the drive to hold data for longer compared to QLC (Quad-Level Cell) mode, which requires distinguishing between 16 states. The article also highlights that this modification not only provides extreme endurance but also improves retention. Manufacturers typically specify retention as the number of years after a certain number of cycles, and the article suggests that the retention in SLC mode may be higher than in QLC mode. The firmware used for SLC mode blocks may also contribute to reliability by employing stronger ECC (Error Correction Code).

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential lack of anonymity in a service claiming to be anonymous. It highlights a few points that raise concerns, such as the leaking of user information to Google, the possibility of being subject to subpoenas or changes in the agreement by the service or its acquirer, ambiguous interpretations of "giving away" information, and the likelihood of data breaches. The article also points out that the lack of identification for those running the service contradicts their stated values of transparency and accountability, which may affect users' ability to hold them accountable for their privacy assurances.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the imbalance of power between landlords and renters in the United States. It highlights the lack of leverage for renters who have issues with their landlords, particularly due to the broken housing system. The article mentions that prior landlord references were required to rent a new place, which posed a challenge for renters with mediocre landlords who may have neglected problems and withheld deposits without reason. Rental management companies are said to be motivated to provide poor service at high prices. The article suggests that the situation is similar to the taxi industry before Uber and Lyft introduced ratings as a form of recourse for riders. The author concludes by stating that most people who extol the benefits of renting have not done so in a long time.
