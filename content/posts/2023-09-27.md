**Total comment counts : 77**

### Summary

 The author, a software engineer at Cisco, encountered an issue with debugging multithreaded applications on a PowerPC32 architecture. After extensive investigation, they discovered that a memory corruption issue caused certain threads to be in the wrong process state, rendering them uncontrolled by the debugger. The issue was traced back to a buffer overflow in ptrace_put_fpr, which led to important fields of task_struct, including the state of the process, being overwritten. The author sent a patch to the Linux kernel security team but faced challenges in getting it accepted, as the PowerPC maintainer preferred their own fix. The author felt that their work was not properly recognized and was discouraged from further involvement in the kernel community.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that it would have been more appropriate to give credit to a person who found and submitted a fix for a security issue, even if their patch was not fully accepted. The author believes that no one else was addressing the issue until this person stepped in. Not giving credit and instead using the person's work without proper acknowledgment is seen as unethical. The author expresses surprise that people support the maintainer who did not give credit. They suggest that if someone took full credit for your work, even if it was a collaboration, it would not feel right and could negatively impact future collaborations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights several reasons why the maintainer's patch is better than the original patch. Firstly, it doesn't lose a test from the 32-bit case. Secondly, it keeps the fallback assignment in the put function. Thirdly, it avoids using a pointless macro. Additionally, the article suggests that the maintainer should acknowledge the thorough investigation and identification of the root cause by Miculas, who had a similar fix. The term "Reported-By" is deemed imprecise in expressing the extent of Miculas' involvement.
