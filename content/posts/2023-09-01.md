 The article discusses the author's experience learning and using knots for sailing. The author reflects on how the names of these knots are challenging in English and even more so in Dutch. Despite this, the author still remembers and occasionally uses a few knots. They liken the process of learning and working with knots to solving 3D puzzles and find satisfaction in figuring out how they work. The practicality of knots in ensuring safety and functionality is highlighted, with the importance of knots staying secure and being easily undone when needed. While it is possible to get by with knowing only a few knots, there are also specialized knots for specific purposes.

## 5. [Things I wish I knew before moving 50K lines of code to React Server Components](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37345727)

**Total comment counts : 45**

### Summary

 The article discusses React Server Components and their advantages and challenges. It starts by explaining the evolution of website generation from server-side rendering (SSR) to client-side rendering (CSR) and the limitations of each approach. It then introduces React Server Components (RSCs) as components that run on the server instead of the client. The article highlights two major advantages of RSCs: the ability to define where code runs (server or client) and the capability to fetch data directly within the component. It also mentions the use of React Actions for server-to-client communication.

The author discusses the challenges faced when migrating to RSCs, such as the lack of support for CSS-in-JS and limitations with React Context. They also mention the complexity involved in understanding where code runs and managing the interactions between server and client components.

The article provides a step-by-step guide for adopting RSCs incrementally, starting with adding the "use client" directive to top-level components and gradually introducing server components for data fetching. It also suggests optimization strategies, such as using React.Suspense for streaming data and creatively rearranging client and server components to control bundle size.

The author concludes by acknowledging the complexity and trade-offs of using RSCs and advises evaluating the benefits against the costs before adopting them.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of server-side rendering, where clients are sent HTML that they can immediately see. It explains that by placing plaintext files on the server, such as .css files, the browser can enhance the appearance and movement of the page. However, the article emphasizes that the most important factor is still having useful content on the first page.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article warns against using React Single-Page Components (RSCs) and suggests using full-stack or classic web frameworks such as Rails, Django, Laravel, or even Elixir/Phoenix, for easier, quicker, and more scalable development. The author cautions that inexperienced developers may encounter problems similar to those faced in older PHP sites, and advises staying focused on shipping actual products efficiently.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a common issue in the retail industry where retail buyers work with suppliers to order products that have promotional or informational sites linked to them through QR codes. These sites are managed by external agencies and are often not known or maintained by the IT teams in the retail organization. When the products are no longer being sold and are placed back in the warehouse, the domain hosting these sites may be lost or compromised. This presents a problem for the IT and security teams, who are then asked to step in and support their colleagues. This situation occurs regularly in retail corporations, but it does not typically have a significant impact on the company's share value or reputation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author understands the concern about a compromised promotional website listed on packaging. However, they believe that conducting a full product recall is overly wasteful. They argue that if a company cannot take care of a URL, they should not heavily advertise it on consumer products. The author highlights the issue of single-use plastics and references the Dogs Trust and the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).

## 7. [Types versus sets (and what about categories?) (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37344026)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses the confusion surrounding the concept of "types" in mathematics, particularly whether types are the same as sets. The author provides a historical background on type theory and set theory, highlighting their respective roles as foundations of mathematics. They discuss various interpretations of type theory, including Church's original theory, de Bruijn's lambda-typed lambda calculus, and the calculus of constructions. The author emphasizes that type theories were initially developed without a specific interpretation in mind and were justified syntactically. They also highlight the importance of notations in mathematics and computer science. The article concludes by discussing the relationship between types and sets, pointing out that while types can be interpreted as sets in some cases, there are also other interpretations possible. The author argues against the idea that all mathematicians are working in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and highlights the dangers of assuming collections that are too big. The article also questions the need for using all Zermelo-Fraenkel sets in category theory.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses various versions of Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory and the calculus of constructions. These theories were created without any specific interpretation in mind, and were justified syntactically through proofs of strong normalization. Models for these theories were developed later. Martin-Löf explicitly discussed the denotational meaning of his theories. The article emphasizes that both type theory and set theory must be connected to the mathematical ideas in order to give them meaning.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of large categories that cannot fit into the ZFC meta-theory. It mentions that most books on category theory address this problem by mentioning universes or classes but then ignore it. The article also mentions that type theory faces a similar problem when talking about the type of all types, requiring the introduction of a hierarchy of universes to avoid logical inconsistencies. It emphasizes the need for a hierarchy of classes or universes to prevent circular self-reference when quantifying over all sets, types, and objects.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's implementation of mastery learning, along with other related ideas, in their software project called "trane." The software is designed to teach ear training and improvisation on any instrument in all keys, modes, and common chord progressions. The author mentions that although the user experience is not yet polished, they have converted courses from a website called "improviseforreal.com" into courses for their software. Currently, the software is focused on piano, but the author plans to expand it to cover more jam tracks. The author also highlights the lack of funding for implementing these ideas and the need for a coherent system that incorporates concepts like mastery learning, spaced repetition, and interleaving. They mention another website called "mathacademy.com" that is similar but not open-source or customizable. Overall, the author's software uses a depth-first search over a graph as its core functionality.
