## 1. [Iran summons families of exiled journalists to halt their activities](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46849715)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 Iran's Intelligence Ministry and the IRGC’s intelligence arm have pressured the families of exiled journalists and activists to curb their relatives’ activities, per Dadban. Separately, Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi warned of a "fateful" moment for a nuclear deal, saying a fair agreement could be reached quickly, but miscalculation is possible. A state TV segment mocked protesters’ corpses from January, triggering outrage and calls to oust IRIB head Peyman Jebelli; Ofogh TV’s director was removed and the program pulled. The incident deepens distrust in IRIB, which is controlled by the supreme leader, with political backlash and fears of further unrest.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread centers on finding a credible political model for Iran while weighing the implications of U.S. military action and questioning media credibility.
- Concern: The primary worry is that U.S. air strikes may have complex, possibly adverse consequences, and that trustworthy reporting on Iran is compromised by propaganda or silence from reputable organizations.
- Perspectives: Views range from seeking a rigorous Iran-focused political model and evaluating which factions might benefit from U.S. air strikes, to condemning violence by the IRGC, to distrusting media coverage and alleging propaganda funding of outlets like Iran International.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 2. [Apple's Q4 2025 margin on Services was 76.5%](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46849588)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 Apple posted Q1 gross margin of 48.2%, above guidance and up 100 bps QoQ, driven by favorable mix and leverage. Product margin was 40.7% (+450 bps) and services margin 76.5% (+120 bps). This marks the highest margins in Apple’s history, with guidance for 48-49% gross margin next quarter. On the call, executives highlighted product mix, iPhone cycle, and growing services, while noting silicon supply constraints and minimal memory impact in Q1 (memory could be a headwind in Q2), a factor already incorporated into the outlook. Analysts questioned durability, but management remains confident in the range.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Concern: The main worry is that these margins indicate market power harming users and brand, and that editorializing or mislabeling margins could mislead the debate.  
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from support for antitrust action due to high margins, to a critique that the post editorializes and misstates margins, to a speculative note that hardware could become loss leaders to support services revenue.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 3. [1-Click RCE to steal your Moltbot data and keys](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46848769)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Depthfirst Research analyzed OpenClaw, a popular open-source AI assistant, and found a critical two-part vulnerability enabling 1‑Click remote code execution. First, insecure ingestion of a gatewayUrl parameter lets a malicious site steer the app to an attacker-controlled gateway and leak an authToken. Second, the WebSocket layer fails to validate Origin headers, enabling Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking to reach localhost from an attacker page. With the stolen token, an attacker can log in, bypass safety features, and execute arbitrary commands via node.invoke. OpenClaw patched the bug by adding gateway URL confirmation modal and removing auto-connect without prompt.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on the security and practicality of AI agents that access personal data and execute actions, weighing secure sandboxed implementations like nono.sh against broad concerns about privacy, data access, and potential abuse. 
- Concern: The main worry is that such agents create large attack surfaces for data exfiltration, misuse, or catastrophic breaches, especially for users who lack security expertise. 
- Perspectives: Views range from cautious optimism about secure sandboxing and incremental improvements (nono.sh features, open to PRs) to strong condemnation of these agents as security nightmares (Moltbot/OpenClaw), with debate over whether sandboxing, zero-trust, and least-privilege can ever make this model safe. 
- Overall sentiment: Mixed — cautious optimism tempered by security concerns.

## 7. [Efficient String Compression for Modern Database Systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46826011)

**Total comment counts : 2**

### Summary

 CedarDB v2026-01-22 adds a novel FSST-based compression for text columns, halving storage and speeding queries. The post shares implementation details, trade-offs, and integration implications. It positions FSST within CedarDB’s existing text compression options—Uncompressed, Single Value, and dictionary-based schemes—and explains dictionary compression: storing a lexicographically ordered dictionary with fixed-size offsets to enable fast random access. Because compressed data is treated as immutable, insertions/deletions are costly, but dictionary order can aid query processing and allow potential smaller key encodings.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The commenter questions how LIKE queries work and expresses unfamiliarity with CedarDB, suggesting it may be just another commercial cloud-hosted Postgres API.  
- Concern: The main worry is that CedarDB could be merely another commercial cloud service offering a Postgres API, with potential issues like vendor lock-in or unclear value.  
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from curiosity about how LIKE queries and CedarDB's capabilities might work to skepticism that it is simply another similar, potentially unproven service.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [I taught my neighbor to keep the volume down](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46848415)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 After moving, we switched to Dish Network with DVR. An RF remote let us control the TV without line-of-sight, unlike IR remotes, but it caused interference: both remotes operated on the same frequency, so pressing a button affected both devices and changed channels. It escalated when my neighbor’s TV obeyed my RF power button as well. I tried to explain the shared frequency, but he slammed the door. The RF feature was effectively disabled and later left unused; the manual suggested another frequency, but I didn’t reprogram it. We kept using IR remotes and stored RF remote in my bedroom.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion is a collage of anecdotes about dealing with noisy neighbors and devices, exploring practical fixes and playful tech-based countermeasures.  
- Concern: The main worry is that taking matters into tech-based retaliation could be illegal, unsafe, or provoke escalation.  
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from practical, non-destructive approaches and neighborly communication to gleeful tales of using RF/IR gadgets for retaliation, plus ethical and safety cautions and nostalgia for older tech.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion links a concept to Russell's paradox, notes difficulty locating title search companies on Indeed, and mentions a 403 Forbidden error suggesting the service may be down.
- Concern: The main worry is that the idea may be paradoxical or ill-defined and the service could be inaccessible due to an outage.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from a theoretical/paradoxical comparison, to a practical job-search analogy, to an immediate accessibility/uptime concern.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 10. [TIL: Apple Broke Time Machine Again on Tahoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46848699)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 After a Time Machine restore failed on two Tahoe Macs using a Synology NAS over SMB, the author traced it to Apple’s unilateral SMB default changes in macOS Tahoe. Workarounds include editing nsmb.conf on the Mac to relax SMB signing and adjusting Synology SMB settings, plus removing Non-ASCII characters from the .sparsebundle name. While the Synology path works temporarily, they plan to migrate to a Docker-based Time Machine target (mbentley/timemachine) on Proxmox for greater control and reliability. They express frustration with Apple’s breaking changes and the ongoing Restore in Progress bug on iOS.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The core topic is the reliability and usability issues of Time Machine backups, especially over network shares and on macOS Tahoe, prompting discussion of alternatives.
- Concern: The main worry is that network backups are fragile and prone to corruption, risking loss of all backups and requiring reinitialization.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from criticizing Time Machine's network behavior and instability to suggesting third‑party or local backup solutions (Arq, SuperDuper, restic, kopia), and attributing issues to Tahoe or seeking better documentation.
- Overall sentiment: Highly critical
