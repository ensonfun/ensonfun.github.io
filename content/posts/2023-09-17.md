## 1. [Cystic fibrosis treatment wins Breakthrough Prize](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37535537)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses how a triple-drug combination called Trikafta has significantly improved the lives of people with cystic fibrosis. The researchers who developed this treatment, Sabine Hadida, Paul Negulescu, and Fredrick Van Goor, have won a Breakthrough Prize for their work. Trikafta helps a faulty protein function correctly, leading to better lung function and overall health for individuals with cystic fibrosis. The article also mentions the other winners of the Breakthrough Prizes, which recognize achievements in life sciences, physics, and mathematics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article shares their personal experience with Trikafta, a medication for cystic fibrosis (CF). Before taking Trikafta, the author had frequent hospital stays and stubborn respiratory infections. Trikafta greatly improved their situation, eliminating hospitalizations and reducing CF symptoms. However, weight gain was a downside due to the pancreatic blockage caused by CF. The timing of starting Trikafta during the pandemic was helpful in keeping hospital beds available for COVID patients and reducing the exposure of CF patients. The author also mentions that some people report experiencing extreme anxiety as a side effect of Trikafta, but their own experience was mitigated due to starting an anxiety medication at the same time.

 The article highlights the positive impact of the medication trifekta on individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Several family members of the author's wife have experienced a significant improvement in their lives after starting on trifekta, to the extent that the disease has minimal impact on their daily lives. The author considers trifekta to be a miracle and a breakthrough. However, there is concern that the compensation received by the individuals involved in the development of the medication is only $3 million, while the actual cost of a dose of trifekta is $10,000.

## 2. [Apple’s new Transformer-powered predictive text model](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37541093)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 Apple announced at WWDC that upcoming versions of iOS and macOS would include a new feature called "predictive text recommendations." The feature suggests words and completes individual words as users type. The author installed the macOS beta and discovered that the predictive text model is used by AppleSpell, an internal macOS application. After some investigation, the author located the predictive text model in a specific file bundle. The model appears to be similar to GPT-2, but with only 6 decoder blocks and about 34 million parameters, making it smaller and faster. The author also compared the model's output to GPT-2's output, showing that the model's limited size affects the quality of its suggestions. Overall, the author found the feature interesting and wonders how it will develop in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their surprise at seeing their post on HN (Hacker News). They offer to answer any questions about the details of the post.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the comparison between Apple's text prediction model and GPT2. The example given suggests that Apple's model may be better because although it generated garbage text, it still made some sense in the context of the word "Today". On the other hand, GPT2 generated random information about the US government, which was not what the user intended to type. Based on this evaluation, GPT2 performed poorly since it did not predict what the user wanted to say.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author needed a data structure with 32-bit integer keys and either FP32 or FP64 values. They didn't want to spend too much time designing one, so they copied and pasted a B+ tree from TLX on GitHub. They made some local changes to improve performance for their specific keys and value types, using AVX2 intrinsics for faster search within nodes and implementing a few other tricks. After these changes, the performance of the data structure became satisfactory for their application.

## 6. [Linear Book Scanner – Open-source automatic book scanner (2014)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37544628)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The Linear Book Scanner is an affordable and open-source machine that allows users to scan books. It works by moving a book back and forth while a vacuum sucks the pages from one side to the other. As the pages travel across two imaging sensors, they are scanned and the software creates a searchable PDF of the book.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a tool called bookbuilder that was created in Java. The tool allows users to manually turn pages, take photos, and then run an automatic process to build a searchable PDF. The tool used a Computer Vision library called BoofCV to detect page contours, deskew images, flatten them, and remove finger contours. It also integrated an invisible OCR layer to create a PDF with searchable text. The author recalls working on improving the flattening process with a line slope detection algorithm. The author mentions that they no longer have the source code for the tool as it was created before they started sharing their projects as open source.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the problem of outdated software in the field of digitizing scanned documents. Currently, hardware is being used instead of software to perform tasks that could easily be accomplished digitally. The author suggests that using multiple photos or stereo images, one could infer a flattened page and produce images that mimic those from a flatbed scanner. The article also mentions the potential of AI to improve the quality of scanned documents, making them indistinguishable from original formats on high-resolution monitors. The author reveals their experience with converting old formats and digital scans into modern font formats, emphasizing the need for software advancements in scanning text. In particular, they suggest the development of a ChatGPT equivalent that can reconstruct LaTeX source and produce accurate reproductions of each page. Additionally, the author mentions the desire for a successor to LaTeX that is more user-friendly and capable of handling fixed and flowable text.

 This article explains that, in Age of Empires tournaments, players are often placed in a separate room from the casters and audience, and their gameplay is live-streamed. This may be due to the fact that live audiences are not very common in these tournaments, so there is less need for players to be physically present in the same room as the audience.

## 8. [Pirates of the Caribbean (Metric Edition) (2017)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37540529)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 This article tells the story of Joseph Dombey, a French physician and botanist, who was intercepted by pirates in the Caribbean Sea in 1794. Dombey was on his way to Philadelphia to meet with Thomas Jefferson and deliver two new French measurement standards: a meter and a mass standard called a grave. The adoption of these standards could have led to the adoption of the metric system in the United States. However, Dombey died before being able to deliver the standards, and the U.S. ended up adopting a British-influenced measurement system instead. It took almost 100 years before the U.S. officially adopted metric standards. The fate of the meter and grave that Dombey had with him is unknown.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the distinction between privateering and piracy, particularly in the context of Britain's actions during its war with France. The author suggests that while some may consider it piracy, it can be seen as legitimate privateering since Britain was at war with France. The article also highlights the popular opinion that privateering is viewed more favorably when done by one's own country, while being labeled as piracy when done by others.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that most countries, excluding the US, Myanmar, and Liberia, use the metric system. Although the UK officially uses the metric system, it is not commonly used in everyday life, with measurements like distance often expressed in imperial units. However, teaching in schools and scientific endeavors mainly rely on the metric system. Temperature is also measured in Celsius. Some individuals, like Jacob Rees-Mogg, still prefer traditional imperial measures. The article also mentions that the speed limit of 112km/h is not commonly seen on speed limit signs in the UK, as it is commonly stated in miles per hour.
