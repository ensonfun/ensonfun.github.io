## 2. [Using S3 as a Container Registry](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40942732)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience developing a custom container image builder in collaboration with Outerbounds1. They share a surprising discovery that S3 can be used as a container registry, allowing users to docker pull from an S3 bucket. The author explains the technical details and benefits of using S3 instead of traditional container registries like ECR. They conducted a benchmark test and found that S3 is up to 8 times faster than ECR for uploading layers. The performance advantage is due to S3's ability to support parallel chunked uploads, which maximizes bandwidth usage. ECR, on the other hand, follows the OCI Distribution Spec and requires sequential uploads. The author also reveals that docker pull is essentially downloading files through HTTP, leading to the possibility of using any static file server as a container registry. However, the author notes that the use of S3 as a container registry is experimental and requires careful configuration.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The OCI Distribution Spec is criticized for not being well-designed. The specification states that layer pushes must happen sequentially, even when uploaded in chunks. However, chunked upload is broken in implementations such as DockerHub and GHCR, where the entire blob/layer is uploaded at once. The spec also does not follow the RFC7233 format for the `Content-Range` value. Additionally, there is no standardization for pagination of listing tags, as some text was accidentally deleted from the standard. As a result, different registries have implemented their own approaches.

This practice is deemed incompatible with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms unless there are active threats to national security or temporary measures overseen by a court. The article suggests that legislation should be implemented to make it illegal for service providers to keep these records.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 AT&T has 110 million customers, and if each customer only spends one extra minute managing their account due to a break-in, that would result in over 209 years of lost time. The article argues that laws related to data breaches should be more strict in order to encourage companies to take data security more seriously. Suggestions include criminally prosecuting those who are negligent in preventing breaches and implementing massive fines that would hold company leadership and stockholders accountable.

## 10. [Making Python Less Random](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40909094)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses a developer's experience with debugging a game prototype written in Python that relied on randomness. The author encountered difficulties in fixing a bug due to the randomness involved. Initially, they attempted to mock the random functions but discovered a third-party library that also had random calls. Instead of refactoring the code or using unittest.mock.patch, the author took a detour to modify system calls to getrandom using strace. They explain the process of using ptrace, a system call, to intercept and modify syscalls to achieve deterministic randomness without requiring code changes. The article provides examples and a link to the source code for implementation.
