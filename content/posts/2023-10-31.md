## 1. [German court prohibits LinkedIn from ignoring "Do Not Track" signals](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38081633)

**Total comment counts : 56**

### Summary

 LinkedIn has been prohibited by the Berlin Regional Court from ignoring "Do Not Track" signals and sharing users' profiles without their consent. The court ruled in favor of the Federation of German Consumer Organizations (vzbv), stating that LinkedIn's communication about tracking practices was misleading. The court also banned LinkedIn from automatically making users' profiles public upon account creation, requiring express consent for profile visibility. The vzbv hailed the decision as a victory for consumer control over personal data. However, while this ruling is a step forward, the author expresses skepticism, stating that real change requires sustained enforcement across the EU and rethinking how sites are built and monetized.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses enthusiasm for a potential solution to getting rid of per-site cookie notices. They propose making Do Not Track (DNT) legally enforceable, which would render cookie notices irrelevant for users who have enabled DNT. The author mentions that their agency, which builds websites for non-profits, already respects DNT by not tracking and not displaying cookie notices. However, they wonder if it might be necessary to present users with a one-time notice stating that tracking has been disabled, as some users may become suspicious if they don't see a cookie notice.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses confusion as to why websites do not use in-house ad solutions instead of relying on third parties. They argue that major websites often have poorly placed and thoughtless ads, and suggests that ads should be handled more like those in magazines or newspapers, with care taken in their selection and placement. The author also believes that tracking for "good ads" is not effective and that people with taste should choose products that consumers would like to buy.
