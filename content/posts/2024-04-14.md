## 9. [How do machines ‘grok’ data?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40020702)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 Researchers at OpenAI discovered a phenomenon called "grokking" in artificial neural networks when they accidentally trained a small network beyond the point of overfitting. Grokking refers to the network's ability to understand and solve problems beyond simply memorizing information. The overtrained network developed an understanding of mathematical operations and internalized the results. This discovery has led to further research and insights into the inner workings of neural networks. Machine learning models aim to transform inputs into desired outputs, and the learning algorithm searches for the best function to achieve this. Neural networks access a limited set of functions dictated by the number of parameters or connections between artificial neurons. During training, a network learns more complex functions, and the loss (discrepancy between expected and actual output) decreases for both training and test data. However, overfitting occurs when the loss on test data starts to rise, and that is when training usually stops. OpenAI's team was exploring how a neural network could perform modular arithmetic and found that when the network was accidentally trained beyond overfitting, it became accurate on unseen data. This discovery provides valuable insights into the understanding and functioning of neural networks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The researchers have come up with a unique algorithm called the "pizza" algorithm. This algorithm involves imagining a pizza divided into slices and numbered. To add two numbers, arrows are drawn from the center of the pizza to the numbers and the line that bisects the angle formed by the arrows is calculated. This line passes through a slice of the pizza, and the number of that slice represents the sum of the two numbers. However, there is confusion about how this algorithm works when applied to certain calculations, like 1 + 1 mod 8.
