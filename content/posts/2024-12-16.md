## 9. [Why is it so hard to buy things that work well? (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42430450)

**Total comment counts : 67**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of market efficiency, particularly challenging the cocktail party version of the efficient markets hypothesis which claims that market competition ensures efficiency, thereby preventing companies from maintaining significant inefficiencies. Here are the key points:

1. **Critique of Silicon Valley Hiring Practices**: The author argues against the notion that Silicon Valley companies are systematically discriminatory due to market pressures to find talent. Despite high demand for skilled workers, inefficiencies in hiring practices persist, suggesting that market forces do not always lead to immediate efficiency.

2. **Market Efficiency in Products and Services**: The article highlights that even in markets for products and services, consumers often make uninformed choices based on marketing rather than quality. Examples include the migration from iPhones to Android phones due to PR issues rather than actual product superiority, illustrating how market inefficiencies can persist due to consumer misinformation.

3. **Capital Markets vs. Labor Markets**: While capital markets might reflect all available information due to the actions of informed participants, the labor market shows different dynamics. Historical examples like Townsend-Greenspan exploiting labor market inefficiencies by hiring undervalued female economists demonstrate that inefficiencies can last long-term.

4. **Persistence of Inefficiencies**: Despite theoretical arguments for market efficiency, real-world examples show that inefficiencies in hiring, product selection, and service quality persist. These are not immediately corrected by market forces, suggesting that the efficient markets hypothesis has limitations in explaining all market behaviors.

In summary, the article argues that while the efficient markets hypothesis might hold in certain abstract or theoretical contexts, practical observations reveal ongoing inefficiencies in various markets, driven by factors like misinformation, lack of transparency, and systemic biases that market competition does not always correct promptly or effectively.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article addresses a misunderstanding about Fivetran's data handling capabilities in relation to PostgreSQL (Postgres). The author clarifies that contrary to a claim made by someone named Dan, Postgres does support maintaining historical data through logical replication, which allows each consumer to keep a bookmark in the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). This means Postgres does not immediately discard changelogs as Dan suggested, but retains them until the consumer acknowledges the data. The author suggests that Dan's quick assessment was incorrect due to a lack of in-depth understanding of the technology, and possibly an overconfident approach to critiquing others' work.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of deciding whether to build software in-house or to buy or use existing solutions, particularly focusing on the JavaScript (JS) ecosystem. Key points include:
