## 1. [Yann LeCun: AI one-percenters seizing power forever is real doomsday scenario](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38108873)

**Total comment counts : 53**

### Summary

 Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, has accused prominent founders in AI, including Sam Altman from OpenAI, Demis Hassabis from Google DeepMind, and Dario Amodei from Anthropic, of engaging in massive corporate lobbying and attempting to control the AI industry through regulatory capture. LeCun warns that if their efforts succeed, a small number of companies will control AI, which will have catastrophic consequences. He argues that the real danger lies in the development of AI being monopolized by private, for-profit entities, while the open-source community is sidelined. LeCun advocates for transparency and open-source development to prevent concentrated power and ensure cultural diversity and democracy are preserved.

## 2. [EU data regulator bans personalised advertising on Facebook and Instagram](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38111483)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The European data regulator has extended a ban on "behavioural advertising" on Facebook and Instagram to cover all 30 countries in the European Union and the European Economic Area. The ban, which targets users by collecting their data, is a setback for Meta Platforms, the owner of the two social media services. Meta could face fines of up to 4% of its global turnover if it fails to comply. The decision by the European Data Protection Board instructs the data regulator of Ireland, where Meta's European headquarters are located, to impose a permanent ban within two weeks. Meta has already announced plans to offer a subscription model to comply with regulations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article believes that personalized ads are more useful than ads that are irrelevant to their interests. They express annoyance towards ads that do not cater to their needs and interests, even though those types of ads are still the most common ones they encounter.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has announced plans to offer users in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) the option to provide consent for personalized ads. In order to comply with regulatory requirements, Meta will introduce a subscription model in November. Therefore, users in the EU who wish to use Facebook or Instagram will likely have to pay for a subscription, as the services won't be available for free without personalized ads due to legal restrictions.

## 3. [Last Chance to fix eIDAS: Secret EU law threatens Internet security](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38109494)

**Total comment counts : 50**

### Summary

 The near-final text of the eIDAS regulation, which regulates electronic identification and trust services in the European Union (EU), has been agreed upon by negotiators. New legislative articles have been introduced that require web browsers distributed in Europe to trust certificate authorities and cryptographic keys chosen by EU governments. This grants EU governments greater surveillance capabilities by allowing them to intercept encrypted web traffic across the EU. Each member state can designate cryptographic keys for distribution and browsers are not allowed to revoke trust in these keys without government permission. There is no independent oversight of these decisions, which is concerning considering the varying adherence to the rule of law among member states. The text also prohibits browsers from applying security checks to these EU keys and certificates, except those pre-approved by the EU's IT standards body, ETSI. ETSI has a worrying track record of compromised cryptographic standards and has a working group focused on interception technology. The introduction of this text behind closed doors and late in the legislative process raises concerns about democratic norms. Over 300 cybersecurity experts and researchers have signed an open letter urging the EU to abandon these plans. Civil society groups and companies in the internet industry have also expressed their opposition. The text will undergo a closed-door trialogue meeting in November 2023 and is expected to be ratified in the European Parliament in early 2024. European citizens and cybersecurity experts can voice their concerns through various channels.

## 6. [Lemming Suicide Myth: Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38106461)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 This article debunks the myth that lemmings commit mass suicide. The myth originated from a Disney documentary in the 1950s called "White Wilderness," which falsely portrayed lemmings jumping into the ocean. The lemming scenes in the documentary were actually staged using careful editing and throwing lemmings off a cliff. Lemmings are a species of rodent found in tundra and grasslands, and they do not have a compulsion to commit mass suicide. Their population fluctuations are influenced by predators, food availability, and climate. When they disperse, they may accidentally drown while crossing bodies of water. Overall, lemmings do not deliberately take their own lives.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the misconception surrounding lemmings and their alleged mass suicide behavior. Contrary to popular belief, lemmings do not intentionally choose to die in large numbers. Instead, their migratory behavior, driven by biological urges and high population density, may lead them to swim across bodies of water in search of new habitats. Many drown in the process, contributing to the false stereotype of lemmings committing suicide. This misconception can be traced back to the late 19th century but was popularized by the staged behavior shown in the 1958 Walt Disney documentary "White Wilderness." The film describes the lemmings' compulsion and obsession to move forward, which aligns with their migratory behavior.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author recalls an experience while hiking during a "lemming year." This particular year, there were thousands of lemmings' dead bodies scattered everywhere. The author describes accidentally stepping on them as they ran under their hiking boots mid-step. Furthermore, the lemmings would approach and attack if the author sat down off the trail. The author finds this behavior both cute and fierce, especially when a lemming exhibited a defensive stance by standing up on its hind legs and emitting a high-pitched shriek. The author concludes that lemmings are peculiar creatures.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the connection between the Raspberry Pi Foundation and ARM, noting that their offices are located near each other and that there are engineers from Broadcom (which previously owned ARM) working at the Foundation. The author believes that the idea of switching to the RISCV instruction set, similar to the "lets rewrite everything in rust" trend, will not gain much traction because ARM is a stable and reliable player in the industry. The cost of ARM licenses is not seen as a significant concern for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and their success is not threatened by sticking with ARM. The author suggests that the strategic investment by ARM is more like a marketing cost, which will help the Raspberry Pi Foundation reach a larger audience. The article concludes that this investment will not prevent the Foundation from exploring RISCV, as they would not have pursued it anyway.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses hope for a future desktop version of Raspberry Pi that improves upon the existing options. While the Raspberry Pi 400 exists, the author finds its use of an SD card as primary storage inadequate. They desire a version with NVMe storage and non-USB connected networking, as well as sufficient cooling and a good keyboard. They also hope that GPIO connections, similar to the Pi 400, are still available. While they do not expect a PCIe expansion slot, they want a more powerful version of the Pi 400 that can serve as a true successor to the BBC Micro. Finally, they emphasize the importance of proper HDMI ports and a high-quality keyboard design, such as that of the Amiga 600.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's partner, an astrophysicist who relies on Gnu Emacs for her work. She manages legacy code in various languages and needs a specific computing environment. Each time she gets a new Mac, she has to set up her environment from scratch because the migration assistant does not meet her needs. Despite having a powerful MacBook Pro, she avoids annual OS upgrades because they used to cause problems with her setup. She has been avoiding OS upgrades for around 7-8 years and using Docker as a potential solution. However, Docker still requires her to take on administrative responsibilities, which can be a distraction in her busy research life.
