## 1. [A startup doesn't need to be a unicorn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43609242)

**Total comment counts : 41**

### Summary

 Matt, a first-time entrepreneur and founder of Vizzly, shares insights from his experience in the startup world in his first post on Substack. After selling Vizzly to WPP in under three years and going through Y-Combinator, he reflects on fundraising and startup success. He critiques the prevalent narratives in B2B SaaS—either the venture capital (VC) path, which encourages aggressive scaling and significant fundraising, or the bootstrapper approach, which promotes sustainable growth without outside investment. 

Matt advocates for a "missing middle path" that involves raising a small amount of funding (less than $1M) while retaining majority ownership and focusing on profitability. This approach, which diverges from the VC model, is under-discussed yet can provide a balanced mix of returns with lower financial risk. He highlights the challenges of both the VC and bootstrapper pathways and argues that many startups fail due to raising too much capital prematurely. He concludes that there’s a critical opportunity for founders during the early funding stages that, if leveraged correctly, can lead to substantial outcomes without the burdens associated with larger fundraising rounds.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a model in Germany that allows entrepreneurs to present a business plan to the state's investment bank to access various financial aids. These include 1.5 years of universal basic income for the applicant and up to two others, up to 20,000 EUR in consulting fees, and discounted loans based on the business plan's outlook. Although many applicants realize their ideas aren't viable during the planning phase, some succeed and create stable, solvent companies rather than hyper-growth startups. The author emphasizes that organic growth and sustainability are the most admirable outcomes of this program, contrasting this with the allure of venture capital funding, which only a few startups pursue.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the prevalence of small, self-funded businesses outside of the venture capital (VC) startup bubble. It highlights that 82% of all U.S. businesses have fewer than 10 employees and that an overwhelming majority (99.976%) of new businesses do not rely on venture capital for funding. This illustrates a stark contrast between the typical VC-backed startup ecosystem and the reality of the majority of businesses, which operate on a smaller, often self-sustaining scale.

## 4. [We asked camera companies why their RAW formats are all different and confusing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580815)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article by Antonio G. Di Benedetto discusses the existence of a universal open-source RAW format for digital cameras, known as DNG (Digital Negative), which is supported by only a few manufacturers. Despite DNG's advantages—such as being open-source, flexible, and capable of storing metadata within the file—larger camera brands like Canon, Nikon, and Sony continue to use their proprietary formats (e.g., CR3, NEF, ARW). This leads to compatibility challenges for photo editing software, making it difficult for users to process RAW files from different camera brands.

Adobe's DNG was created in 2004 to streamline RAW file handling and enhance future compatibility, but it has not gained widespread adoption among major brands. While smaller manufacturers and those with ties to Adobe often utilize DNG, larger companies prefer proprietary formats for better control over image processing and optimization based on their unique hardware capabilities. The article highlights the contrast between the advantages of a universal format and the reasons manufacturers choose to maintain proprietary systems, emphasizing the ongoing fragmentation in the RAW format landscape.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the simplicity of RAW formats used in photography, highlighting that the camera firmware is usually developed in countries with limited open-source software traditions. It points out that the decoding process for RAW formats involves basic binary parsing, metadata reading, and decompression, averaging about a thousand lines of C++ code for each format. Unlike complex codecs like HEVC, these RAW formats only approach JPEG complexity when dealing with embedded thumbnails. While cameras could use the more standardized DNG format, doing so would face challenges such as coordination with Adobe and potential language barriers, which might hinder creative experimentation. Ultimately, photographers typically do not prioritize these technical aspects, as raw processing software is generally available shortly after new camera releases, and this does not significantly affect camera sales.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the complexities of raw decoding in image processing, highlighting that it’s an ideal stage for implementing specialized enhancements such as noise reduction and HDR processing. The author, who previously worked at a camera manufacturer, emphasizes the intensity and secrecy surrounding their raw decoder, noting that while third-party deinterlacers can achieve impressive results, they cannot fully replicate the company's decoder performance.

## 7. [Journey to Optimize Cloudflare D1 Database Queries](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43572511)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience working with Cloudflare Workers and the D1 database, highlighting the challenges faced, particularly with database performance and queries. It emphasizes that while both services are from Cloudflare, they do not inherently improve each other's performance. The author provides several key insights and strategies for troubleshooting database-related issues:

1. **Batch Operations**: For write operations, using D1's batch operations is more efficient than performing multiple individual queries, as it reduces REST requests.
2. **Care with IDs**: When updating records, exclude the ID field to minimize row reads, which can lead to unnecessary database load if foreign keys are involved.
3. **Pagination Strategies**: Switching to cursor-based pagination instead of offset-based can significantly reduce the number of rows read and improve efficiency.
4. **Avoiding Cartesian Products**: Complex joins can result in unexpectedly large result sets; therefore, breaking down queries to manage joins is recommended.
5. **Bulk Inserts**: Instead of multiple single inserts, combining records into a single SQL statement can enhance performance, although D1 has a limit on bound parameters requiring data chunking.

The author concludes that server-side issues require careful monitoring and thorough testing, acknowledging that solving one problem might lead to others. Continuous evaluation and adjustment are crucial in managing database performance effectively.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author evaluated the performance of D1 for a project and found it unsatisfactory, particularly noting poor time-to-first-byte (TTFB) metrics both in Europe and internationally. The TTFB exceeded 200ms even in Europe, which is considered unacceptable. The article suggests that frontend developers should be aware of database challenges but advises against using D1, recommending instead a hosted Postgres solution for better performance and capabilities.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a limitation in handling transactions in a database (referred to as D1), where a transaction cannot span multiple requests, meaning you cannot perform a select, execute application logic, and then write to the database atomically. Instead, you can combine multiple statements into a single batch request executed at once. To ensure atomicity in such scenarios, the author describes creating a batch request that includes a precondition check that triggers a JSON parsing error if the condition is not met, thereby aborting subsequent statements in the batch. However, for more complex transactions, it may require creating tables for temporary values and translating application logic into SQL statements to maintain atomicity.

## 8. [Reinventing Feathering for the Vectorian Era](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43577338)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 In a blog post by Chris Dalton, Head of Runtime at Rive, he discusses the development of a new vector-based feathering system for the Rive Renderer, addressing long-standing requests for glow and shadow effects in design software. Dalton criticizes the traditional method of using Gaussian blur for these effects, as it requires rasterizing vector shapes into bitmaps and applying computationally expensive convolution filters, leading to less efficient and non-scalable results. He highlights the historical misuse of Gaussian blur, initially designed for data smoothing rather than graphics, and proposes a more efficient approach that directly applies calculations to vector curves without rasterization.

Dalton recalls conversations with Rive's leadership, including CEO Guido Rosso's enthusiasm for this feature and the desire to build a renderer free from the constraints of outdated SVG specifications. He emphasizes the need for modern algorithms to match contemporary hardware capabilities and outlines Rive's mission to transform interactive design through its proprietary tools, consisting of the Editor, the .riv file format, and open-source Runtimes. The overarching goal of the project was to innovate beyond legacy design practices and create a more efficient vector rendering system capable of delivering high-quality visual effects.

## 10. [Data centers contain 90% crap data](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605695)

**Total comment counts : 49**

### Summary

 The article discusses the alarming issue of "crap data" generated and stored by organizations, which is harming the environment and contributing to a wasteful digital landscape. It highlights that over 90% of commercial or government data is deemed useless, often created without intention of being read or accessed again. The author notes the exponential increase in data, specifically the millions of digital files—photos, videos, reports—many of which are never viewed. Despite the ease of content creation due to digital tools and the cloud, organizations struggle to manage their data effectively, with vast amounts of unused content cluttering their systems.

The author shares examples showing that a significant percentage of content goes unvisited, asserting that many organizations lack awareness of their own data storage and are overwhelmed by copies of files. This rampant accumulation of "crap data" not only wastes resources but also hampers the effectiveness of AI models trained on such flawed information. Ultimately, the article calls attention to the environmental impact of unnecessary data storage and the urgent need for better content management practices.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the vast amount of data that organizations store, noting that a significant portion remains unused after being stored—highlighting a case where 1,500 terabytes were rarely accessed. It draws a parallel to car insurance, where many people pay for policies that they don’t utilize, suggesting that they could save money if they recognized this waste. The author uses sarcasm to emphasize that much data is kept for potential future needs, such as personal photos or business records that might be important later. While acknowledging that there is waste in data storage, the author argues that it often makes sense to keep data, as determining what is necessary can be more time-consuming and expensive than merely storing everything.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author recounts their experience working on a large data migration project at a FAANG company about fifteen years ago, where they migrated multi-exabyte data across many countries. After completing the migration, the old storage platform still contained some data, primarily because users were more focused on ensuring their data was successfully migrated rather than deleting everything from the legacy system. As they prepared to shut down the old storage clusters, they realized that some of the leftover data might be subject to litigation holds, which prevented its deletion. This concern led to several months of discussions with legal teams to navigate the complexities of the situation, as the leftover data spanned multiple jurisdictions and totaled dozens of petabytes. Despite their confidence that there was unlikely to be significant leftover data that wasn’t migrated, they found it impractical to thoroughly inspect such a vast amount of data. Ultimately, the team developed methods to categorize the data, which extended the project timeline by over six months, presenting an interesting challenge that had not been anticipated during the initial planning focused on technical aspects of the migration.
