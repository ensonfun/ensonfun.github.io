## 3. [Why is the volume of a cone one third of the volume of a cylinder? (2010)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36548684)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article discusses various methods of deriving the volume of a cone without using calculus. It mentions using Cavalieri's principle, a visual demonstration with water filling, and a geometric approach involving frustums. The conclusion is that the volume of a cone is equal to 1/3 of the product of its base area and height. The article also includes a personal observation about relating the dimensions of a cone to a triangle in a box.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the origin of the fraction 1/3 in geometric calculations. It suggests using Pappus' second theorem, which states that the volume of a solid of revolution is equal to the area of the original shape multiplied by the distance traveled by its centroid. The centroid of a triangle is determined by distances from its three sides, which explains the presence of thirds. The article mentions that the OP refers to this theorem and someone mentions Pappus in the discussion. The article also touches on the mystery of how Pappus figured out the relevance of centroid distances, considering that the proofs of the theorem rely on calculus. Overall, the article provides a satisfying explanation for the geometric origin of the fraction 1/3.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author ponders whether there is a deeper reason behind why a triangle's area is half of the base multiplied by the height. They assert that, from a calculus perspective, it makes sense that the number of dimensions becomes a divisor, regardless of whether there is a mathematical proof connecting the two.

## 4. [First 'tooth regrowth' medicine moves toward clinical trials in Japan](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36563590)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 A Japanese research team is developing a medication that could potentially allow people to grow new teeth. Clinical trials are set to begin in July 2024, with the goal of making the tooth regrowth medicine available for general use by 2030. The medication is intended for individuals who lack a full set of adult teeth due to genetic factors. In previous animal experiments, the medicine successfully prompted the growth of "third-generation" teeth. The lead researcher, Katsu Takahashi, believes that if successful, this medication could be a game-changer in the field of dentistry. It has the potential to provide an alternative to dentures and implants for individuals who have lost their teeth due to severe cavities or dental issues.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that a tooth regrowth medicine is being developed for individuals who are missing adult teeth due to congenital factors. However, using it to regrow teeth for those who have lost them is a different matter altogether. So, it is advised not to get too hopeful and to continue brushing teeth.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two different methods of tooth implantation. In medieval times, teeth were forcibly taken from healthy young individuals and implanted into gums with an unknown success rate. In contrast, the article suggests a safer and more efficient method of growing teeth from a patient's own stem cells in vitro and then implanting them, requiring minimal testing.

## 8. [Beyond Markdown (2018)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36556261)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses the limitations and complexities of the CommonMark spec, which is based on John Gruber's Markdown syntax description. The author suggests revising certain features that have led to bloat and complexity in the spec. They specifically address six pain points, such as the ambiguity and complexity of emphasis parsing, the difficulties in parsing reference links, the complications caused by indented code blocks in list items, and the challenges posed by block-level HTML in the spec. The author proposes solutions to each of these pain points, including simplifying the emphasis syntax, making reference links recognizable by their shape alone, removing indented code blocks, and reevaluating the handling of block-level HTML. Overall, the author encourages considering a new project under a different name to address these issues and create a more streamlined and user-friendly markup language.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests removing the doubled character delimiters for strong emphasis and using a single underscore (_) for regular emphasis and a single asterisk (*) for strong emphasis. The author expresses frustration with typing underscores on a screen keyboard and mentions that in the past, a forward slash (/) was commonly used as a delimiter for emphasis. The author proposes using the forward slash (/) as a better delimiter for emphasis, as it is easier to type on a US keyboard and iOS screen keyboard.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author respects the contributions made to Commonmark but questions why Markdown is the most widely used markup language for prose. Their opinion is that Markdown's lack of a well-defined specification allows for greater tolerance of formatting errors and inconsistencies. They argue that a perfectly-specified markup language would likely become unreadable due to committee-driven pursuit of precision. The author suggests that this theme of simplicity over complexity can be seen in other areas of technology as well.

## 9. [A Look at Bluesky](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36557378)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 Bluesky is a new social networking platform that competes with Mastodon. It uses the Authenticated Transfer Protocol (atproto) and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) to create a federated and decentralized network. Users' usernames are domain names that correspond to cryptographic URLs called DIDs. One advantage of atproto is that user accounts can be transferred between servers, even if the original server is down. User data is stored in data repositories, which are signed, public databases that can be verified by other sources. However, the system of using domains as usernames opens the possibility for people to claim domains they don't have access to. Furthermore, interactions on atproto are public, which can lead to harassment. The platform also allows for the creation of custom algorithms for timeline sorting, but this opens the risk of inappropriate or offensive content being displayed. While Bluesky has some advantageous features, such as server migration and custom algorithms, it is criticized for being overly complicated and could have been implemented as extensions to the existing ActivityPub protocol.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses uncertainty about ATProto but highlights a significant advantage it offers over ActivityPub: the ability to separate identity and content from an instance. They do not want to run their own Mastodon server, nor do they want to rely on someone else's server. They express frustration over the possibility of losing followers and quality posts if a server shuts down or behaves like Twitter. The author suggests that ActivityPub should explore ways to support this separation to keep up with the growing dissatisfaction towards centralized platforms and lack of data ownership.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article expresses skepticism about the launch of a federatable protocol and platform as a non-federated, centralized one. The limited registration policy is seen as creating a sense of exclusivity and increasing demand. The author also mentions that the project is led by Jack, who founded and managed pre-Musk Twitter 1.0 and funded Musk's Twitter 2.0. The author states that they have low expectations and hopes for the project.

## 10. [GPT-Migrate converts repos from one lang/framework to another](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36558032)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The article discusses a project called GPT-Migrate, which aims to help migrate codebases from one framework or language to another. Migration is often a difficult and time-consuming process, but GPT-Migrate aims to simplify it. The article provides instructions for using GPT-Migrate, including installing Docker, setting up the OpenAI API key, and specifying various options for the migration process. The article mentions that GPT-Migrate is still in development and has limitations, but they are actively working on improving it and seeking contributions from the community.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article raises concerns about the author, copyright holder, and copyright license of code generated by a tool. It emphasizes that using such a tool on any code, especially an employer's intellectual property, should only be done if the answer to all these questions is clearly "the original." The author warns that AI does not exempt users from copyright law, as they are essentially exchanging their code for new code under a third party's terms and conditions. It is advised to understand these terms before submitting any code, particularly if one does not own the code.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author believes that language models like GPT-3 (LLMs) could excel at tasks that involve detailed legwork but are not technically challenging. This could be particularly useful when dealing with legacy codebases in outdated languages or frameworks. The author suggests that while thorough testing and some manual work may still be necessary, it would feel more like polishing something new and maintainable rather than trying to fix a broken system. The author also ponders the potential future ability to instruct an LLM to make code look like their own or another developer's style, which could be beneficial for forming developer teams based on coding styles.
