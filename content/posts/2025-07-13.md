 The concept of "aesthetic completeness" refers to video games whose art direction is fully realized, meaning advancements in graphics wouldn't enhance the artistic value. The original Homeworld games exemplify this idea. The author reflects that creating artworks using modern tools instead of those from the original period would fundamentally alter the pieces, emphasizing that the medium is integral to the artwork itself.

## 2. [Bypassing Google's big anti-adblock update](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44544266)

**Total comment counts : 72**

### Summary

 Google Chrome is transitioning from Manifest Version 2 (MV2) to Manifest Version 3 (MV3), removing the webRequestBlocking permission crucial for adblockers. A developer discovered a bug in 2023 that allowed webRequestBlocking to function in MV3 by exploiting leftover JavaScript bindings, which should not have been possible. This bug let extensions spoof the opt_webViewInstanceId parameter, enabling adblockers to bypass permission checks. Despite its potential, the bug highlights how outdated code can lead to vulnerabilities, as the related code still exists in 2025, despite platform apps being deprecated in 2020.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

Additionally, it mentions that the xz breach was uncovered by a developer investigating unusual SSH login performance issues.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The Gravity Forms post clarifies that users who installed the plugin via direct download or Composer are considered compromised. Both installation methods use the same API as the plugin’s auto-update feature. It remains to be seen if the developers will engage a third-party security firm to investigate the incident, as no mention has been made yet.

## 4. [New Date("wtf") – How well do you know JavaScript's Date class?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44540241)

**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the complexities of handling local time in software development. It suggests prioritizing UTC ISO 8601 strings or Unix timestamps to minimize complications. While recognizing that some scenarios, such as dealing with daylight saving time, can be challenging, the author emphasizes that most projects can effectively limit their reliance on local time. They advise against passing raw user input to date parsers, indicating that this could lead to issues. Overall, the focus is on simplifying date-time management in applications.

## 5. [The fish kick may be the fastest subsurface swim stroke yet (2015)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44541576)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article explores the fish kick technique in swimming, which mimics the natural movement of fish and is believed to be the fastest subsurface swimming method. After a challenging initial attempt, the author receives guidance from Olympic gold medalist Misty Hyman. Despite being a struggle for humans, who are not natural swimmers, the fish kick focuses on precise body movements at the shoulders, ribs, hips, and knees. Historically, swimming has centered on surface techniques, but underwater strategies have gained attention for their speed potential, reshaping how the sport is approached.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The "fish kick," a variation of the dolphin kick performed on one's side, is faster due to reduced constraints from water movement. In the traditional dolphin kick, water moves up and down, influenced by the surface and pool bottom. By turning sideways, swimmers alleviate these restrictions, enhancing their kicking efficiency.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article compares terrestrial mammals’ natural abilities in running and swimming. Unlike running, which humans excel at due to our evolved body plan, swimming does not come instinctively or naturally for humans. It discusses how nearly all terrestrial mammals can swim to some extent and ponders which mammal might swim best if trained, while noting that human body design, suited for bipedal running, also permits reasonable swimming capability. However, it concludes by acknowledging that human swimming speeds are significantly slower than those of aquatic animals.

## 6. [Supreme Court's ruling practically wipes out free speech for sex writing online](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44543865)

**Total comment counts : 82**

### Summary

 The recent Supreme Court ruling has undermined the First Amendment for writers including sexual content intended for adult audiences. It permits conservative states to sue writers for damages based on claims that such content harms children, enabling felony charges for online speech without age verification. This decision poses a significant "chilling effect" on free expression and threatens writers with severe criminal and civil liabilities. The author calls for action against this censorship and emphasizes the need to protect free speech in light of these new laws, urging those affected to educate themselves and join the Free Speech Coalition.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes ID check laws, arguing that they improperly place the responsibility of child-rearing on the government and websites. It advocates for a secure method to verify age (18+) without sharing personal IDs or details. A suggested solution involves using biometric authentication, similar to Apple Pay, to confirm age transparently. Additionally, the author supports the idea of allowing single-user devices to auto-send age verification for convenience. The overarching concern is the protection of personal data and the impracticality of current ID verification methods.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article warns that implementing age verification for pornography could extend to requiring identity verification across much of the internet. This shift threatens the concept of a free internet, regardless of one's views on pornography.

 The author acknowledges the urge to cut government spending, which often appears excessive. However, they argue that certain programs deliver high value for the investment, acting as assets rather than wastes. The positive impacts of these programs extend significantly beyond initial investments. The article calls for a return to sound principles in evaluating and requesting budget allocations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author advocates for transferring global responsibilities to the United Nations rather than nation-states or private companies, arguing that collective global support is essential to prevent one nation's failure from impacting humanity. They propose a UN program for weather forecasting and satellite tracking utilizing open data, but express concern that the current structure and vested interests of Security Council members hinder this initiative, suggesting that the EU may be more likely to assume such roles instead.

## 8. [First malaria treatment for babies approved for use](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44500815)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 A new malaria treatment specifically designed for babies under 4.5 kg has been approved and will soon be available in African countries. Developed by Novartis, the drug, called Coartem Baby, addresses the "treatment gap" for young children who previously used older formulations that posed overdose risks. Malaria claimed approximately 597,000 lives in 2023, mostly among children under five. Novartis plans to distribute the medicine on a not-for-profit basis, marking a significant advancement in combating malaria’s impact on vulnerable populations. Experts believe this could greatly improve healthcare equity for affected children.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 An Italian physician, working in Africa, reported that treatments for babies over 6 months have been successful. A significant advancement with Novartis now allows safe treatment for infants under 6 months with the correct dosing.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article expresses surprise at a study that involved only 28 participants, questioning the adequacy of such a small sample size given malaria's widespread prevalence. While the study did include a 12-month follow-up, the author wonders why a larger group wasn't utilized.
