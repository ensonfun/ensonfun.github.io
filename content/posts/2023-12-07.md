## 1. [Building end-to-end security for Messenger](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38552789)

**Total comment counts : 52**

### Summary

 The article announces that Facebook has started upgrading personal conversations on Messenger to use end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default. The aim is to ensure that only the sender and intended recipients can access personal messages and to provide assurance that messages are from authentic senders. The implementation of E2EE on Messenger required rebuilding various aspects of the application protocols to improve privacy, security, and safety while maintaining popular features. The article also mentions that Messenger previously introduced end-to-end encrypted chats in 2016 through Secret Conversations. The ultimate goal is to protect people's communications and allow them to feel safe expressing themselves with friends and loved ones. The piece then explains eight overlapping concepts that contribute to achieving meaningful E2EE, including secure transmission of message contents, user verification and management of endpoint devices, device-to-device functionality, confidentiality of message content, security challenges, and defining the boundaries of message content protection.

 The article criticizes a new initiative to responsibly deploy generative AI models and experiences for not addressing the threat of prompt injection. The author finds it baffling that the issue is barely acknowledged in the Responsible Use Guide. They mention two research papers that only focus on related risks, such as generating insecure code and detecting toxic content, but fail to address prompt injection. The author argues that prompt injection is a significant challenge that needs to be overcome for the responsible deployment of applications built on large language models (LLMs), and highlights the risks associated with LLMs having access to private data and untrusted inputs. They criticize the AI safety announcement for not explicitly addressing the issue of prompt injection and suggest that Meta AI is hiding the biggest security threat to LLM systems.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses both disappointment and delight in response to a statement about tools to evaluate Language Model Models (LLMs) in the context of cybersecurity. They are disappointed because generating "malicious" code for research or demonstration purposes is a legitimate use of LLMs. However, they are also delighted because as long as not all LLMs assist in cybersecurity-related requests, their job security as a security researcher is ensured.

## 9. [23andMe updates their TOS to force binding arbitration](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38551890)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 This article discusses how 23andMe, a personal genomics and biotechnology company, is responding to a recent cybersecurity breach. Instead of enhancing security measures, 23andMe has chosen to implement binding arbitration for disputes as a legal shield. The company experienced multiple breaches, with the hacker claiming access to over 4 million genetic profile records initially and later confirming a total breach of 6.9 million users. Lawsuits were filed against 23andMe for negligence, and users criticized the company's handling of the situation. To further complicate matters, 23andMe is now updating its Terms of Service to require binding arbitration for resolving disputes, preventing users from pursuing lawsuits or participating in class action suits. Users have a 30-day window to opt-out of these new terms. The article highlights concerns about bias against consumers in arbitration processes, as shown by a study conducted by the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that there should be a "common law" solution for terms of service (TOS) agreements. They propose predefined categories for software services with preset rules to prevent abuse. They compare this to the societal framework in brick-and-mortar retail where stores must operate within certain rules. The current system incentivizes corporations to claim as much legal ground as possible in TOS, which leads to a de facto corporate-controlled state. This undermines the rule of law culturally, as many terms in TOS may be unenforceable when challenged in court, putting users at a disadvantage.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The user is summarizing an email requesting to opt-out of the updated Terms of Service for the website 23andMe. The email includes the user's name and associated email with their account, and formally requests to not consent to the terms outlined in the recent update. The user thanks the team for promptly processing their request.
