## 1. [Tell HN: Help restore the tax deduction for software dev in the US (Section 174)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44226145)

**Total comment counts : 69**

### Summary

 A major effort is underway to reverse a tax code change that prevents software development expenses from being immediately deductible. Luther Lowe from Y Combinator (YC) is organizing alumni and urging US taxpayers to support this reversal by signing a letter to lawmakers. The change classifies engineer salaries as capital investments, resulting in costly depreciation over five years, increasing the expense of hiring software engineers. This topic has generated significant discussion on Hacker News, reflecting a strong community consensus for action. US taxpayers are encouraged to participate, but non-US individuals should refrain from signing to maintain the letter's impact.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Section 174 limits how companies can deduct costs for software engineers on their taxes. Instead of treating salaries as immediate expenses, companies must capitalize them and depreciate over five years. For instance, a $200k salary becomes a $40k expense annually for five years, making engineers more costly. This rule, unique to software engineers and not applicable to other personnel, forces companies to effectively lend money to the government during this depreciation period, impacting cash flow even during unprofitable years. This provision was enacted during the Trump administration to offset corporate tax cuts.

 As workers flocked to the cities of Barmen and Elberfeld, which merged to form Wuppertal in 1929, the need for a public transport system arose. Due to the area's rocky terrain, a conventional underground system was impractical, leading inventor Eugen Langen to create the Schwebebahn, which began operation in 1901. Although Wuppertal was established later, the transportation project was planned and funded by both cities’ joint commission before the merger.

## 6. [I used AI-powered calorie counting apps, and they were even worse than expected](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44220135)

**Total comment counts : 50**

### Summary

 Calorie-tracking apps like Cal AI and MyFitnessPal's photo feature aim to simplify calorie counting by using AI to analyze food images. However, this approach suffers from significant inaccuracies; for instance, Cal AI misidentified a plain apple as tikka masala and underestimated its calories by 33%. In more complex meals, the app’s estimates were laughably low, often failing to account for hidden ingredients like dressing. This reveals a major flaw in photo-based calorie counting, as depth and volume cannot be accurately assessed through two-dimensional images, making accurate tracking highly problematic.

 The founder of SnapCalorie clarifies that the app is completely free, with the $79.99 price being a donation for research support. SnapCalorie’s algorithm is more accurate than visual portion size estimation, though both methods have limitations. Photo logging offers a quicker approach, while voice logging and a kitchen scale provide more accuracy, all available for free. The app encourages users to focus on sustainable habits rather than meticulous tracking to achieve their health and fitness goals.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Calorie tracking helps educate individuals on the calorie content of foods, enabling better dietary choices. For example, oil is high in calories, while greens are low. Once this knowledge is gained, tracking serves to maintain accountability, as one’s perception may be skewed when tempted to cheat, causing small lapses that can undermine a diet.
