## 7. [A beetle that heads for the ‘back door’ when eaten by a frog (2020)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36967829)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 A Japanese water beetle known as Regimbartia attenuata has been observed escaping from the digestive tracts of frogs after being swallowed, according to a study conducted by ecologist Shinji Sugiura of Kobe University. The beetles were able to survive and emerge unharmed by wiggling their way out of the frog's anus. This is the first time that researchers have witnessed prey actively escaping from their predator's body after being consumed. Sugiura speculates that the beetle has evolved this ability as a defense tactic against the frog. The beetles were observed to traverse the frog's inner organs, including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, in as little as six minutes. The study also found that the beetle relied on its legs and possibly stimulated the frog's cloacal sphincter to facilitate defecation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is expressing a connection between a German poem called "Storch und Schleiche" and a story about a stork and a blind slow-worm. In the story, the stork initially eats the slow-worm but the worm escapes through a back door. The stork then eats the worm again, but this time blocks the escape route. Despite the stork's efforts, the slow-worm finds another way out and the stork eats it again. Finally, the stork cleverly connects both doors to prevent any further escapes. The article provides a link to the German poem for reference.
