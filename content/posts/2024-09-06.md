### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author finds a particular image of a Teller-Ulam type weapon unusual because it includes channels that appear to transfer energy from the primary to the secondary device. The author suggests that these channels may be a superficial and unconfirmed addition, and without rigorous testing it is impossible to determine their validity. The author believes that the image is likely a hypothetical representation created by someone with limited physics knowledge, and showing it to North Koreans would not significantly advance their nuclear program.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of standardized models in computer simulation projects for the Navy, specifically in relation to battleships. These models have general properties that resemble real battleships but are not based on any specific design to avoid revealing classified details. The author speculates if a similar approach is being used by the Department of Energy (DoE) with a standardized notional warhead design to provide to outside researchers who may not have security clearance.

## 2. [What happens when you touch a pickle to an AM radio tower](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41462574)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The author conducted an experiment where they grounded a hot dog to an AM radio tower. They measured various factors such as RF output and signal demodulation. They also tested a pickle and a bratwurst, which produced interesting results. The vegan hot dog performed similarly to the all-beef hot dog, but with some differences in sound and appearance. The author emphasizes that this experiment should not be attempted without consulting experts and following safety measures.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article explains why videos about AM towers are common on YouTube. AM radio energy pulses, creating audio noise, while FM signals broadcast at a consistent power level. AM towers are larger because the wavelength of AM signals is longer, and they carry a higher amount of energy, making them more dangerous. AM can be operated on FM frequencies, such as in aviation radios.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author proposes that low-power broadcasting hobbyists should be allowed to use the band currently occupied by BBC and commercial AM radio stations in the UK, which are expected to close in the coming years. They argue that this would generate interest in radio as a technology and provide opportunities for enthusiasts to engage with various aspects of radio broadcasting. The author suggests that a minimal licensing regime could be implemented to ensure responsible use, along with a fee to PRS for music rights. The power of the transmissions could be limited to avoid interference with other countries, especially at night. The author believes that little content enforcement would be necessary, as the target audience would likely be limited to radio enthusiasts. They also mention the potential for preserving technology history and preventing old radio receivers from becoming e-waste.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In this article, the author discusses their experience using LwIP (Lightweight IP) for system testing in a project that involved multiple microcontrollers communicating over an internal LAN. They used an embedded kernel called MicroCOS, with LwIP as the IP stack. The author explains that they had cross-platform build tools, allowing them to build microprocessor applications for native execution or with gcc, compiling to x64 code. They implemented the lowest level link-layer part of LwIP using a mock that used standard TCP/IP. They also created a small TCP server and spooled up the micro-controller applications on developer machines, allowing them to communicate with each other as though they were running inside the actual system. The author concludes that this setup worked well and was used throughout the development effort for the project.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the capabilities of IP Stack, which is described as being more than just a regular IP stack. It can function as a HTTP client, HTTP server, or MQTT client. The author suggests that in practice, IP Stack is often used in these ways. It is compared to the busybox of embedded networking, but with a more convenient license.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the composition of the contemporary commercial merchant fleet, which consists of approximately 80,000 ships. About a third of these ships are bulk liquid carriers or oil tankers, a decrease from the 1970s/80s when half of all commercial ships were tankers. The majority of growth in the fleet has been in container ships. The article also mentions the significant loss of oil tankers by the US during World War II, with 129 tankers lost in American waters in the first five months of 1942. As a result of these losses, the US government built the "Big Inch" and "Little Big Inch" long-distance oil pipelines from east Texas to refineries on the Atlantic seaboard in New Jersey. These pipelines are still in use today. The author highlights the similarities in the circumstances required for both large-scale commercial shipping and whales, including the ability to rapidly load and unload cargo, widely-separated ports or feeding grounds, and the absence of significant predators or hazards. Finally, the article mentions the prerequisites for bulk shipping such as global markets, cargos that can be handled in aggregate, and the need for canals, safe shipping routes, and cargo handling capacity at ports.
