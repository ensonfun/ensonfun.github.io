### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on the issue of software bloat in various code editors, such as Emacs and Visual Studio. They mention that while some editors claim to be lightweight, their actual memory usage can increase significantly when extensions or plugins are installed. They provide examples of Visual Studio becoming slower with the installation of ReSharper and Visual Studio Code consuming a large amount of RAM and startup time when loaded with numerous extensions. The author also criticizes the approach of including all desired extensions in a shared Devcontainer, as it forces everyone on the team to have those extensions installed. They conclude by suggesting that the problem of bloat might lie with users adding too many plugins rather than the editors themselves.

## 2. [Let's Write a Reverb (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41253850)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 This article discusses a clean and flexible approach to designing a high-quality reverb using a feedback-delay network (FDN) structure. The author highlights the advantages of the FDN approach, which allows for a decent-sounding reverb with low CPU usage. The article explores the concept of a feedback loop, where the input signal is sent through a delay and then fed back into the delay input, creating a series of echoes. The article also introduces a multi-channel version of the loop, where each channel is delayed by a different amount to produce a complex and diverse reverb sound. To further enhance the complexity, the article suggests including a mixing matrix inside the feedback loop. The use of an orthogonal matrix is recommended, as it maintains the energy balance between the input and output channels. By introducing cross-mixing, the echoes become more frequent, resulting in a chaotic and reverb-like effect. The article cautions against excessive inter-channel mixing, as it can lead to cohesive tails and may require careful tuning. The goal is to design a feedback loop that produces a diffuse and long-lasting reverb effect.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

The author suggests that companies should invest more in research for user-driven systems rather than relying on auto-generated lists.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of recommendation systems that do not consider the actual content of what they are recommending, such as music, books, or movies. It questions whether track embedding vectors, which are used in recommendation systems, contain content-derived information or are solely based on metadata. The author expresses doubt about the ability of recommendation systems to provide meaningful results without "awareness" of the content. The analogy of a deaf DJ using charts data to make decisions is used to explain the limitations of such systems.

## 8. [Toasts are bad UX](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41298794)

**Total comment counts : 82**

### Summary

 The article discusses the common issue of toast notifications being displayed far away from the user's attention. It uses examples from YouTube and Gmail to illustrate problems with the placement and redundancy of toasts. A simple redesign of the "Save" interaction is proposed as a solution. The article also mentions the usefulness of toasts for undo functionality and when using keyboard shortcuts, but emphasizes that they are unnecessary when there is already confirmation in the interface. It concludes by stating that while toasts are better than no feedback at all, it is important to consider alternative feedback mechanisms.

 I apologize, but as a text-based AI assistant, I am unable to browse the internet or open specific links. Could you please provide me with the text from the article that you would like me to summarize?

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues against the notion that redundant user experience (UX) is bad. The author disagrees with the idea that having multiple ways of communicating the same information is bad UX. They believe that redundancy in communication is a feature, as it ensures the message gets through in less than ideal conditions. In the case of toasts (a type of notification), the author argues that having a standardized way of communicating the status of actions, along with additional indicators, is valuable for users. Removing the toast and relying solely on specific indicators would require users to learn multiple ways of understanding when an action is complete. The author concludes that unless toasts are hindering the user experience, they should not be considered bad UX, but rather redundant UX that can benefit certain user groups.
