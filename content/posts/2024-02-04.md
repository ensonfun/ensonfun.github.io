## 1. [Why is the mouse cursor slightly tilted and not straight?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39248225)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 This article discusses the reasons behind the tilted arrow cursor commonly used on computer screens. The cursor was initially designed to have a tilted arrow shape for easier recognition and drawing on low-resolution screens. The angle of the cursor also provides a vertical left edge, which helps when highlighting text. Additionally, the tilted arrow cursor is more easily found by the human visual system due to a phenomenon known as the popout effect. The article also mentions a subjective observation that the arrow cursor resembles pointing with a right hand, which may have influenced its design. Overall, the tilted arrow cursor has become the standard due to its practicality, visual recognition, and user experience considerations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author regrets choosing Xamarin.Forms for their startup's apps and believes they should have used Avalonia, Flutter, or ReactNative instead. The migration from Xamarin.Forms to MAUI and from .NETFramework to .NETCore was difficult and time-consuming. The main reason for choosing Xamarin.Forms was because Avalonia lacked mobile support, but it is unclear how Avalonia's mobile support is now. The author prefers mobile-focused development and believes desktop support should be an afterthought due to declining desktop usage.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Avalonia, which is a framework similar to Flutter for .NET. Both frameworks use Skia for UI rendering, but there are key differences. Avalonia uses .NET and XAML, while Flutter uses the Dart language. Although Flutter is better suited for mobile, Avalonia has recently expanded to mobile and offers a more mature desktop experience. For teams skilled in .NET and XAML, Avalonia is likely a better choice. It is recommended for .NET shops that don't require a platform-native look or feel and have a desktop-focused project.

## 8. [Browser extensions are underrated: the promise of hackable software (2019)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39251095)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 Browser extensions are an important and unique ecosystem that allow users to customize their apps in ways that were not intended by the original developers. Despite recent controversies, browser extensions offer users deep control over their software. They allow users to modify everything from visual design to core functionality, essentially creating their own personalized email clients or other applications. The popularity of browser extensions shows that many people are interested in customizing their software, not just power users. Extensions are widely used and offer a broad range of functionalities such as password filling, language support, design simplification, article annotation, and ad-blocking. The flexibility of browser extensions is possible because they can modify applications in ways that the original developers did not plan for. The web's deployment style, layout model, and standardized markup play a role in enabling this extensibility. Although it may require some clever tricks, extension authors are willing to put in the effort to create useful software. Website developers generally accept extensions that extend their sites creatively as long as they don't have to do extra work. Extensions also benefit application developers by allowing their users to get more value from their applications. Many browser extensions are generic tools that enhance the user's experience across all websites, providing leverage in different contexts. These extensions are often free and created by individuals or small communities. Overall, browser extensions offer users greater control and customization options, changing the way we interact with software.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses their evolving perspective on customizable software over the past five years. They mention that AI is becoming better at coding and could be useful for writing browser extensions. However, they also emphasize the importance of security when it comes to extension platforms. They suggest exchanging extensions with trusted parties or building your own to mitigate security risks. The author acknowledges that the limitations of browser extensions arise from their inability to access backend data and code. They propose a local-first approach to software development as a solution to this limitation, where data and code reside on the user's device. The article includes links to further reading on AI-assisted programming, resolving tensions in extension platforms, and the concept of local-first software.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In 2024, the framing of "browser extensions" is seen as problematic. Most of these extensions, particularly for Google Chrome, show that Google is willing to prioritize revenue over the safety of APIs. Developers should be aware that their efforts may be rendered useless by Google in the future. Instead, the focus should be on Firefox extensions, which, although not perfect, are a better alternative to deal with.

 This article is about the difficulties the author faced when trying to import a CPAP machine from the United States into Vietnam. The machine costs significantly more in Vietnam, so the author attempted to import one instead. However, they discovered that a prescription is required in the United States to import a CPAP machine. They obtained a prescription through an online service and had the machine sent to a freight forwarding service, but there were issues with the paperwork. The machine was held in Vietnamese customs for almost four months, and the author had to visit customs weekly to argue for its release. They faced various reasons for denial, including the machine appearing used and suspicion of reselling. Eventually, someone suggested bringing a prescription, but it was difficult to obtain one in Vietnam. After multiple attempts, the author was able to convince customs to release the machine based on their sleep apnea test, although nobody actually checked the test. Despite the frustrating bureaucracy, the author prefers it over American insurance.

 This article discusses the issue of compliance with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines in the US insurance system. Insurers often require access to the machine's usage logs before approving reimbursement. These machines have tamper-proof logging mechanisms, including cellular modems, which allow surveillance by insurance companies. This surveillance is seen as offensive and intrusive, and it also hinders sleep apnea treatment. Many people find it difficult to adjust to using the CPAP machine, particularly sleeping with the mask on, which can be attributed to psychological factors and the fear of financial consequences if they can't make it work. This fear can lead to poor sleep and people giving up on CPAP treatment. However, if used properly, CPAP can be life-changing for those with sleep apnea. It is recommended to consult a doctor if you suspect a breathing problem during sleep, as there are alternative treatment options available.
