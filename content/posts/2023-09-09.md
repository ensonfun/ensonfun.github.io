### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that when a person sits in the passenger seat of a Subaru that uses connected services, they have consented to the use and potentially sale of their personal information. This includes details such as name, location, audio recordings, and inferences about the person's characteristics and behavior. The article argues that simply sitting in someone's Subaru should not automatically grant consent for the use of personal information, especially for purposes like data brokering or targeted advertising. The article also points out that Subaru is not the only car company engaging in this practice. The reader questions the legality and validity of such consent, particularly when being a passenger in a friend's Subaru or an Uber.

## 3. [Newly discovered comet Nishimura could be visible to naked eye this weekend](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37413387)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 A comet called Nishimura, discovered just a month ago, may be visible to the naked eye this weekend. This is a rare chance for stargazers in the northern hemisphere, as comets usually take months or even years to reach peak visibility after discovery. Nishimura will pass closest to the sun on September 17th and will then pass by Earth at a safe distance. The best time to observe the comet is before sunrise in a northeastern direction, to the left of Venus, in a clear sky. People with small binoculars should be able to see it easily, and if conditions are right, it may even be visible without any equipment. The comet's tail appears greenish due to its high gas content.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 There is a bright comet called Comet Nishimura (C/2023 P1) in the morning sky. It is not visible to the naked eye, but digital cameras can capture its starlike head and long tail even with short exposures. The comet is getting closer to the sun and increasing in brightness rapidly. Its estimated magnitude is +4.5, which would be visible to the naked eye in a dark sky. However, since the morning sky is not dark, cameras are needed to observe the comet. Just a few seconds of exposure time can result in a beautiful picture.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article talks about a new discovery that could potentially cause problems if it gets closer. Despite feeling existential dread, the author plans to be on a hill, watching for this object which was previously unknown and will soon be visible to the naked eye.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article had success with converting raster images into vector images in Inkscape using the "trace bitmap" feature. They were able to clean up and make adjustments to the images, although this may require some manual work depending on the source. They give an example of converting a small, low-resolution GIF into a fully scalable SVG that became the official replacement for a government agency's logo. The author also praises Inkscape for its ability to easily create complete icon sets and mentions that it has an API for batch processing.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that in order to create a vector image from a raster image, one must use vector software that is capable of performing a bitmap trace, like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. The author expresses disappointment because it seems that the process does not directly create a vector image by itself, and wishes there was a method that connects the two parts of the problem.

## 5. [The Development of the C Language (2003)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37442810)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The C programming language was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, during the creation of the Unix operating system. The language went through several periods of development and changes, with the first widely available description appearing in 1972. By the mid-1980s, C was officially standardized by the ANSI X3J11 committee, and its use spread beyond Unix to become one of the most commonly used languages in the computer industry. The development of C was influenced by the desire for a higher-level language for system programming and the limitations of the hardware at the time. The language initially began as B, which was a simplified version of BCPL. B and C are both procedural languages oriented towards system programming and are designed to be "close to the machine." They have a single data type called "word" or "cell" and rely on library routines for input-output and other interactions with the operating system. B was later extended to include a character type and was renamed NB before evolving into C. The transition from B to C coincided with the creation of a compiler capable of generating efficient machine instructions, allowing programs written in C to compete with assembly language.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the discovery of some code that the author believes was written in NB. The code is compiled to threaded code like B, but has knowledge of characters like C. Though it doesn't perfectly align with the author's story, they are unsure of what else it could be. The article includes a link to the code.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the Amiga OS and its development from BCPL to C. Initially based on a port of TRIPOS to the Motorola 68000, Amiga OS eventually transitioned to using C. In AmigaOS 1.x, AmigaDOS was still written in BCPL, which made application development challenging. AmigaOS 2.x introduced C and attempted to maintain compatibility with BCPL. It wasn't until AmigaOS 4 that the BCPL heritage was completely abandoned. The author reflects on the capabilities of AmigaDOS at the time, noting its surprising capability and modern features. The transition to PC from Amiga felt like a step back in time, as DOS lacked multitasking in a visual environment and other advanced features found in Amiga OS.

## 8. [FTC judge rules Intuit broke law, must stop advertising TurboTax as “free”](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37441982)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The Federal Trade Commission's chief administrative law judge ruled that Intuit, the company behind TurboTax, violated US law with deceptive advertising. The judge stated that Intuit should be required to clearly display all conditions of its "free" offer to consumers. Intuit plans to take the matter to federal court but will be subject to an order if it loses the appeal. The judge found that Intuit falsely advertised that consumers could file their taxes for free using TurboTax when, in reality, this was only true for a third of taxpayers. Intuit must not represent its product as "free" unless it actually offers it for free to all consumers or clearly discloses any fees at the beginning of the offer. The ruling sets strict requirements for how disclosures must be conveyed in various formats. Intuit also previously settled a separate case and agreed to pay $141 million in restitution to consumers. Intuit believes the FTC's decision is improper and ignores the facts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that the entire tax filing software industry is unnecessary and suggests that the IRS should develop and offer its own online filing system to all Americans free of charge. It criticizes companies like Intuit for lobbying to create an industry that is financially beneficial to them.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues against the outsourcing of primary responsibilities by public institutions. While public service outsourcing is limited in Turkey, the author believes it is a good regulation. However, certain responsibilities such as the maintenance of roads should not be outsourced. The author also mentions that tax filing and return processes should not be outsourced as they are primary responsibilities of the government. The author contrasts this with their experience in Estonia, where they can easily fill in tax returns in under 10 minutes. Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of public institutions fulfilling their job descriptions and providing efficient services to the public.
