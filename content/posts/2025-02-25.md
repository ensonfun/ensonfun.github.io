## 1. [Hyperspace](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43173462)

**Total comment counts : 52**

### Summary

 The article traces the author's fascination with file systems, beginning with his early experiences with the Macintosh and its unique file handling features. His enthusiasm continued through various operating system developments by Apple, particularly focusing on the introduction of the Apple File System (APFS) in 2017, which replaced the older HFS+. APFS introduced features like point-in-time snapshots and copy-on-write clones, which significantly improved file management and backup processes.

The author discusses how APFS's clone feature allows for nearly instant file duplication without consuming additional disk space, as the cloned files share the same data blocks. Motivated by space constraints on his Mac, he developed a script to identify and convert duplicate files into clones to save disk space, which led to the creation of his app, "Hyperspace." This app, now available on the Mac App Store, uses APFS's capabilities to reclaim disk space by converting duplicate files into clones without deleting any files, appealing especially to users who hoard digital files.

The development of Hyperspace involved modern technologies like SwiftUI and Swift 6, marking it as a significant project in the author's portfolio. Despite its potential risks due to modifying system files, the author sees it as a valuable tool for many Mac users.

Tim Callan from Sectigo has criticized DigiCert for these delays, suggesting that DigiCert should enforce clearer revocation policies and ensure clients can promptly replace their certificates. The issue has raised concerns within the WebPKI community about the potential misuse of legal measures to delay revocations, with Sectigo being particularly vocal. There is a growing call for DigiCert to manage these delays more effectively to avoid legal and community backlash.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the high stakes involved in the management of Web Public Key Infrastructure (Web PKI), particularly focusing on Certificate Authorities (CAs) like DigiCert. The author finds the dynamics of power in this sector fascinating because any CA can be swiftly removed from trust stores by entities that oversee which CAs are trusted, potentially devastating their business. The scenario where DigiCert, described as the largest CA on the Internet, might face such consequences is highlighted as particularly dramatic and chaotic. While the author believes this outcome is unlikely, they find it amusing to imagine the repercussions for any DigiCert employee who might have initiated a risky legal action. The article suggests that DigiCert's recent actions in a legal dispute are more damaging to its reputation than any statements made by their opponent, Collan.

## 4. [It’s still worth blogging in the age of AI](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43166761)

**Total comment counts : 52**

### Summary

 The article discusses the perceived diminishing value of blogging in the age of AI tools like ChatGPT, which can quickly synthesize and regurgitate information from blogs without giving due credit. Here are the key points:

1. **Learning and Reflection**: Blogging serves as a tool for personal learning and reflection. The act of writing helps solidify knowledge regardless of whether the content is widely read or used by AI.

2. **Visibility and Engagement**: Despite the potential for AI to overshadow individual bloggers, engagement from readers, although rare, provides a personal satisfaction or "dopamine hit." However, building a personal brand through blogging alone is challenging, as fame typically requires additional achievements outside blogging.

3. **Altruism vs. Personal Gain**: While blogging can be altruistic, there are personal benefits like recognition and community engagement. However, the author notes that most people do not delve into personal details of bloggers, focusing instead on the content itself.

4. **AI and Content Consumption**: AI tools might use blog content to answer queries, often without proper attribution, which diminishes the direct traffic and recognition for bloggers. This raises concerns about the future of blogging when AI can deliver synthesized information directly.

5. **Encouragement for Interaction**: The author encourages readers to engage with bloggers by leaving comments or reaching out, emphasizing the importance of human interaction in the digital content space.

6. **Realistic Expectations**: Blogging isn't likely to make someone famous by itself; it's one part of a larger body of work or achievements that might lead to recognition.

In summary, while AI might reduce the traditional benefits of blogging in terms of traffic and direct reader interaction, the intrinsic value of blogging for personal development and occasional community engagement remains significant.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's casual approach to blogging compared to others who use it as a strategic tool for networking and career advancement. The author finds it interesting how some people on Hacker News (HN) utilize blogging to market themselves and build a professional persona, while he himself blogs purely for personal amusement, with little expectation or concern for readership or professional gain. He mentions that AI or broader implications do not influence his decision to continue blogging.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of active thinking through personal expression in writing and drawing, rather than passively absorbing information from external sources like teachers or AI systems. It critiques the educational system observed by physicist Richard Feynman in Brazil, where students merely memorized facts without understanding. The author suggests that tools like AI can assist in enhancing our thinking and creativity, but warns against losing our individuality and critical thinking skills.

It recommends two books that explore the connection between physical actions like drawing and hand usage with cognitive development and cultural evolution.

## 5. [Clean Code vs. A Philosophy Of Software Design](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43166362)

**Total comment counts : 65**

### Summary

 The article details a discussion between software design experts Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin and John Ousterhout, focusing on their differing views on software design principles as outlined in their respective books, "Clean Code" by Martin and "A Philosophy of Software Design" by Ousterhout. Here are the key points:

1. **Philosophical Agreement**: Both authors agree that the primary goal of software design should be to make it easier for programmers to understand and modify code. They emphasize reducing complexity, which involves minimizing the amount of information developers need to understand the system.

2. **Method Length**: A significant point of contention is method length. Martin advocates for extremely short methods (ideally two to four lines) to enhance readability and modularity, arguing that even blocks within control structures should ideally be one line long. Ousterhout, while agreeing with the concept of modular design, argues that too much subdivision can lead to "shallow" interfaces that don't significantly reduce cognitive load and might even complicate understanding.

3. **Discussion Approach**: The dialogue is structured to explore their differences in opinion through specific topics like method length, comments, and test-driven development (TDD). However, the summary provided only touches on method length before the text cuts off.

4. **General Principles**: Martin adds that the ease of reading code is paramount since programmers spend more time reading code than writing it, which aligns with his advocacy for concise methods.

This discussion highlights the nuances in software design philosophies, focusing on how different strategies for code structuring can influence the maintainability and understandability of software systems.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 **Summary:**

Structural Dynamics Research Corporation (SDRC) was an early adopter of the Software as a Service (SaaS) model in the 1970s by providing engineering software like ANSYS and NASTRAN on timesharing systems. However, the company faced significant challenges in the 1990s:

- **Financial Scandal**: In 1994, SDRC had to restate its financials from 1992 to mid-1994 due to a $30 million discrepancy in sales from its Asian operations. This led to the termination of a vice president involved in these operations. The sales discrepancies involved misrepresenting software sales by storing products in a warehouse rather than selling them, and insiders selling their shares before the issue became public.

- **Recovery and Acquisition**: Despite the scandal, SDRC managed to recover and was eventually acquired by EDS.

- **Product Development**: SDRC's software, I-DEAS, was praised for its user interface which was considered advanced for its time, featuring intuitive icon menus that were easier to navigate than competitors' systems. Although it might seem outdated now, the interface was user-friendly and well-designed for mechanical design and analysis.
