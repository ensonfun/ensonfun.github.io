**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 The author of the article discusses their ongoing battle with spammers on a free-to-use platform called Bear. The low barrier to entry attracts spammers who try to exploit the platform for backlinks. To combat this, the author has implemented mechanisms such as reviewing all content before it is visible and using a spam detection tool called Akismet. However, some spammers have found ways to bypass the system and post spam in less regulated areas. To frustrate spammers, the author has created a "Frustration Loop" where, instead of blocking spam, a fake system error is presented to waste the spammers' time and make them give up. This approach has significantly reduced the amount of spam on the platform. The author acknowledges that there are still improvements to be made, but overall, the system is working effectively.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Mike Davidson, a former ESPN co-worker who founded a community news site called Newsvine in 2006. Newsvine was similar to Reddit, focusing on news and featuring comments, upvotes, and link submissions. To combat spammers and trolls, the team implemented a system where users could be flagged as trolls on the backend. Once flagged, a random 10-60 second delay was added to every page load for the troll's account. This approach proved effective in solving the problem.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author worked inside Akismet for over 6 years, a software system that is effective in detecting comment spam. However, it is not as effective in detecting signup spam, which is why there are many spam blogs on Wordpress.com.
