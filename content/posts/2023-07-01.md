## 6. [TabDB: Using browser tabs as a database like only a maniac would](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36548055)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article discusses using browser tabs as a database, specifically an in-browser database that utilizes tab titles for storage. Whenever an SQL query is run, the database grabs data from neighboring tab titles, combines it, unzips it, and loads it into an in-memory sqlite database. After executing the command, the state of the database is converted into a string, compressed, and distributed across available tabs. The article acknowledges that the code is not well-structured but clarifies that it is a simple project rather than a production-ready solution.

### Top 1 Comment Summary
