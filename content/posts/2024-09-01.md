### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the difference between "actually a startup" mode and "a growing, professionalizing company" mode. The author highlights that when there are three layers of management between them and the CEO, the company has transitioned out of startup mode. The author argues that startups require individuals who can do the work and fill in when needed, rather than "professional managers" whose primary skill is managing. They caution against moving to a professionalizing stage too early, as it could lead to the displacement of those who have in-depth knowledge and commitment to the product.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that the dichotomy between a "founder" and a "manager" is false. It suggests that the difference lies in understanding the intricacies of a business and being able to utilize that understanding to navigate beyond the organization's hierarchy. The article further emphasizes that leaders who lack a comprehensive understanding of the business and aren't willing to engage with all aspects of it are less effective compared to those who view the business as more than just a financial tool.

## 4. [Einstein's Other Theory of Everything](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41415647)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses Albert Einstein's attempt to develop a unified field theory, which combines space, time, energy, and matter. Einstein wanted to explain matter as a deformation of spacetime, similar to how he explained gravity. He tried to find equations that would have solutions corresponding to fundamental particles like electrons but ultimately failed. Einstein's knowledge of the properties of matter was limited at the time, with only gravity and electromagnetism to work with. He believed that electromagnetism could be described in a similar way to gravity. However, he concluded that his approach did not work because the quantity that could be interpreted as mass could take on any value, while actual particles have specific values. Einstein also explored black holes, but his attempt to use them as a clue for his unified theory was unsuccessful. Overall, Einstein's unified field theory remained unfinished.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the views of physicist Sabine Hossenfelder are not widely accepted among the majority of physicists. While she is considered a legitimate physicist, she has been criticized for portraying her views as more accepted than they actually are and for ignoring counter-arguments. The article also states that her ideas about topics like the explanatory power of entanglement in relation to processes such as moon orbits around Jupiter are considered outside the realm of regular astrophysics. The author advises readers to proceed with caution when considering Hossenfelder's perspectives.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that an alternative model to explain gravity is by imagining twisting a lump out of a sheet of silly putty. This model shows that the surrounding putty is pulled along with the twisted lump, causing a distortion similar to how gravity acts on objects.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the functionality and limitations of the Link Preview API. The author praises the tool for its ability to display previews in the default interface of different platforms. However, they note that the behavior of the meta-crawlers may vary across platforms, and the previews may not always match what is seen elsewhere. The author suggests that it would be helpful to report any redirects that occur when following links. They also mention that the target URL should be included in the URL query parameters or fragment. Without specifying data in the URL, the tool is seen as a cute web page feature, but with data controlled by the URL, it becomes a native and shareable web utility. The author updates their thoughts based on a tweet they received.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article appreciates a helpful tool but requests that they not be required to type out the full URL when referencing a website. Instead, they suggest that the tool automatically add the necessary format when a more concise reference like "example.com" is entered.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the boiling points of various elements, with beryllium having the lowest boiling point at 2742K and zirconium having the highest boiling point at 4650K. It also mentions that the temperature in a TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) process can reach temperatures close to 3000K, which is higher than the boiling point of beryllium. This suggests that beryllium vapor was likely produced in the process. The author speculates that the beryllium vapor may not have escaped from the apparatus due to various factors, but warns about potential risks of beryllium condensation. The article also mentions similar issues with silicon refining. Lastly, a table is provided with the melting and boiling points of several elements.

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 error

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the problem with Maproulette, which is the gamification aspect of the platform. Some users prioritize earning imaginary internet points, leading them to edit OpenStreetMap (OSM) in a careless manner. They disregard ground truth, fail to analyze tasks properly, and often make slight mapping errors worldwide. Additionally, the default setting in Maproulette is such that when a task is completed, the system takes users to another task randomly. This further exacerbates the issue, as users may delete tags or make incorrect changes without verifying their accuracy to earn more points.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses tasks that the author finds confusing. They mention one task about traffic lights at an intersection that doesn't actually have traffic lights. The other tasks involve instructions about highways not being on the ground and lacking elements like tunnels, bridges, or covered tags. However, the author notes that these tasks are not related to highways or roads.
