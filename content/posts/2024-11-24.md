## 1. [Frosted glass from games to the web](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42225481)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 The article discusses a UI developer's experience working on "Forza Horizon 3" and "Forza Motorsport 7," focusing on the creation of a frosted glass effect in web design. Here are the key points:

1. **Inspiration and Goal**: The developer was inspired by the frosted acrylic design elements used in the games and wanted to replicate this effect using HTML and CSS.

2. **Techniques Used**:
   - **Gaussian Blur**: The primary method to achieve the glass effect is through a Gaussian blur, which is implemented in CSS using `backdrop-filter: blur()`. There are browser compatibility issues, particularly with Internet Explorer not supporting this feature.
   - **Box-Shadows**: To enhance the glass appearance:
     - **Edges**: `box-shadow: inset` is used instead of borders to create the illusion of glass edges without affecting the element's size or its children's layout.
     - **Depth and Elevation**: A traditional box-shadow gives the glass a raised look from the background.
     - **Subsurface Scattering**: Simulated with another `box-shadow: inset` to mimic how light disperses within translucent surfaces.

3. **Challenges and Solutions**: 
   - The article addresses the limitation in cross-platform compatibility, offering alternatives for platforms where `backdrop-filter` isn't supported.
   - It also goes beyond a basic blur effect to make the glass look more realistic by adding depth, light interaction, and reflective qualities.

4. **Educational Content**: The developer provides sample code and assets for others to experiment with the frosted glass effect. Additionally, there are links to tutorials for creating similar visual effects.

5. **Conclusion**: The article concludes by showing how these techniques can be combined to create a visually appealing and interactive glass effect in web design, enhancing the user interface's aesthetic appeal.

## 4. [Which power plant does my electricity come from?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42183747)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Western Energy Crisis of the early 2000s, focusing on the 2000 power outage in the San Francisco Bay Area which was part of a series of blackouts in California. This crisis was primarily triggered by economic factors rather than technical failures:

1. **Market Manipulation**: The deregulation of the electricity market allowed companies like Enron to manipulate prices, causing a significant spike in electricity costs. Utilities had to buy power at these inflated prices but were limited in how much they could charge customers, leading to financial distress.

2. **Economic Impact**: The crisis resulted in billions in economic losses, with utilities like PG&E filing for bankruptcy due to unsustainable financial losses.

3. **Complexity of the Grid**: The electricity market's complexity is highlighted, involving not just engineering challenges but also intricate economic and regulatory frameworks. The article explains that electricity's unique nature as a commodity that cannot be easily stored requires real-time production and consumption, which adds to the complexity of managing supply and demand.

4. **Historical Context**: Previously, utilities were vertically integrated, controlling generation, transmission, and distribution, which meant they operated as monopolies. Over time, the necessity for utilities to interconnect led to the formation of power pools and eventually large interconnected grids across North America, aimed at reducing variability and risk.

5. **Regulation and Deregulation**: The shift from regulated wholesale electricity pricing to a deregulated market where manipulation could occur is critiqued, suggesting that while interconnection helped in managing supply, the economic aspects of power trading needed better oversight.

The narrative underscores the need for understanding both the technical and economic dimensions of the power grid, especially in light of how economic manipulation can lead to widespread energy crises.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how localized energy pricing could benefit consumers and the energy market by aligning supply and demand more effectively:

1. **Local Energy Contribution**: Solar panels or batteries in homes contribute power to the local grid, but this isn't always reflected in energy pricing or distribution efficiency.

2. **Resistance from Power Suppliers**: Traditional power companies oppose flexible pricing because it would make their more expensive energy sources less competitive.

3. **Example of the UK**: The UK's uniform national energy pricing leads to inefficiencies. Scotland, with its abundant wind power, often has to curtail its excess energy while gas plants in the south run to meet local demand, resulting in high prices for all despite the surplus in some areas.

4. **Benefits of Local Pricing**: If Scotland had local pricing, energy costs would decrease due to the availability of cheap wind power. Conversely, areas with high demand might see incentives to develop local generation or attract energy-intensive industries to where energy is cheaper, optimizing the use of resources.

This scenario highlights the potential for more dynamic energy pricing to better match where and when energy is produced with where it's needed, potentially lowering costs and reducing waste.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the economic dynamics of renewable energy sources when connected to the electrical grid. Here are the key points:

- **Incentives for Renewables**: Renewable energy producers, particularly those like solar farms, receive substantial incentives for every megawatt-hour (MWh) they generate. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers incentives up to $33/MWh.

- **Negative Bidding**: Due to these incentives, renewable energy providers sometimes submit negative bids, essentially offering to pay to remain connected to the grid. This strategy reflects the financial incentive they receive rather than an actual willingness to pay. If a solar farm is guaranteed $18/MWh, it might bid -$18 to ensure they still make a profit after accounting for costs.

- **Impact on Traditional Power Plants**: This practice can disadvantage traditional power plants like nuclear facilities, which must run continuously. These plants might end up having to accept these negative prices, leading to financial losses unless they receive compensatory payments from the market or government.

- **Market and Policy Implications**: The system of incentives and negative bidding creates a market where renewable energy sources have a financial advantage, potentially distorting energy pricing and affecting the viability of other energy sources that do not receive similar support. 

This dynamic shows how government policies and market mechanisms are designed to promote renewable energy, sometimes at the expense of other forms of energy production.

 The article criticizes the decision to connect Large Language Models (LLMs) to potentially dangerous machinery like flamethrowers or cars. It argues that due to the well-known unpredictability of LLMs, such as through "jailbreaks" or "prompt injections," those responsible for these setups should be held accountable for any resulting damage or injuries. The author suggests that using LLMs in such applications is reckless and compares it to using a random number generator (RNG) for control, emphasizing that the hype around LLMs does not justify negligent behavior in managing hazardous equipment.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses whether there are ongoing efforts to implement Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics into real-world robotics:

1. **First Law**: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. **Second Law**: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. **Third Law**: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

The author of the article is seriously inquiring if these laws or a better model for robot behavior are being developed. The reasoning behind this interest is that if robots had a deep understanding of how harm can occur to humans, they could prioritize human safety above all else, theoretically preventing dangerous behaviors or "jailbreaks" by rejecting any instructions that might cause harm. This would align with the core principle of the Three Laws where human safety supersedes all other directives.
