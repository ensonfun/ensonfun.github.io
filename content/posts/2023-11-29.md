### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two incidents involving airplane crashes. The first incident involves the shootdown of Iran Air Flight 655 and is detailed in the Admiral Cloudberg blog. The second incident involves the crash of Air France Flight 447, which was caused in part by a User Experience (UX) mistake. The crash occurred because the inputs from two control sticks were averaged, causing conflicting inputs to be minimized. The pilots' contradictory actions had little effect on the plane's recovery, and by the time the problem was identified, it was too late to prevent the crash. The captain had re-entered the cabin just before the crash and realized the problem, but it was too late to take corrective action.

## 4. [Rust std fs slower than Python? No, it's hardware](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38457247)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The article discusses an investigation into the slower performance of OpenDAL's Python binding compared to Python itself. The author refactors the code and discovers that the Python binding for OpenDAL is slower than Python, even when OpenDAL is implemented in Rust. The author analyzes the syscalls using strace and realizes that Python's use of mmap for memory allocation is a contributing factor to its faster performance. The author then tests the code with jemalloc, a proficient memory allocator, and notes that it improves the performance significantly. The article concludes by mentioning that the slower performance of Rust compared to Python was only observed on the author's machine and could be due to CPU vulnerabilities or system settings.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a comparison between different Python wrappers around native code in terms of performance. The author finds it odd to describe one wrapper as "slower than Python" since the Python standard library is not exclusively written in pure Python. They expected the functions in the library to be native code and optimized individually. The conclusion of the article also took some effort to understand, as the phrasing of "C is slower than Python with specified offset" gave the impression that C code was slower than Python even with the same offset. However, it is actually the opposite, as specifying the offset in the C code made it faster than Python. Despite the confusing start and conclusion, the article remains interesting.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Seafile is a file sync storage system that stores files using a structure inspired by Git. Instead of directly storing files, Seafile divides them into blocks using a Content Defined Chunking algorithm. This allows for deduplication of data between different versions of frequently updated files, improving storage efficiency and enabling parallel data transfers between servers. It is generally compatible with older PCs, but it's recommended to have a backup in case of data corruption in the Seafile repositories. For more information, you can refer to the Seafile manual and a research paper on the topic.

## 9. [To move fast, quantum maze solvers must forget the past](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38433990)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Researchers have long wondered if it is possible to find the exit of a maze quickly without forgetting the way, in a world governed by the strange laws of quantum physics. A recent study by Matthew Coudron and his colleagues showed that no algorithm in a broad class of fast quantum algorithms can find a path through a special maze called a welded tree graph without temporarily losing track of the entrance. This finding suggests that forgetting is inevitable in quantum algorithms. Quantum computers owe their power to superposition, which allows them to explore many options simultaneously. However, not all computational tasks can benefit from a quantum speedup. In the past, quantum algorithms have been successful in factoring large numbers and solving search problems. While the speedup achieved by Grover's algorithm was modest, it demonstrated the value of quantum superposition.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of forgetting the past and compares it to solving a maze by pouring water into it. The author finds it amusing how leaving the task of figuring out the outcome and fixing any resulting issues to future science is akin to this process.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author mentions their observation that academic papers often "bury the lede" or the main point of the research beyond the abstract. They express their opinion that it would be more effective to highlight the main point explicitly and then provide a recap linking it back to the original idea. They believe that both computer science and math papers could benefit from a more structured outline throughout the paper.
