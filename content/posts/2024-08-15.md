## 2. [Font with Built-In Syntax Highlighting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41245159)

**Total comment counts : 49**

### Summary

 The author of the article explores the challenges of hand-coding websites using HTML and CSS without relying on frameworks or third-party scripts. They specifically focus on the roadblock of syntax highlighting when displaying code snippets. Traditional syntax highlighters require external scripts and add complexity to the page. To overcome this, the author proposes embedding syntax highlighting directly into a font using OpenType features. They modify an open-source font to include colored versions of each character and use contextual alternates to replace specific strings of code syntax. They provide instructions on how to implement this method and acknowledge its limitations. The article also explains the features of OpenType that make this possible, such as the COLR table and contextual alternates. The author provides examples of substitution rules for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS keywords.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a small issue with the use of OpenType features in a post. It points out that the "colr" feature tag is meaningless in the font's OpenType layout tables, and it does not need to be activated using the "font-feature-settings" property. Additionally, the "calt" feature is supposed to be active by default, so there's no need to explicitly set it. The font works in Firefox and Chrome but not in Safari.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article believes that the power of substitution rules has been underestimated. They suggest that it should be possible to recognize any regular language by dragging a state machine along. The article provides an example code snippet that handles quoted strings, but it has not been tested. The author is unsure if context can be carried between different lines.

## 9. [The Myth of the Product-Market Fit (2013)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236351)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 Product Market Fit (PMF) is a concept that was popularized by Marc Andreessen, but its application in the real world is often misunderstood and abused. PMF is not a discrete event, and founders may struggle to articulate when it has been achieved. Furthermore, PMF in one market does not guarantee success in another market. Even if PMF is achieved, there is no guarantee of business success, as startups can lose PMF over time. Additionally, using Google Adwords to establish PMF before developing a product is not a reliable validation process. Startups are constantly validating and face various challenges at different stages. PMF is just one piece of the puzzle, and factors like distribution channels, partnerships, and technological advancements also influence startup success. The journey of a product to scale should be seen as a continuous series of PMF points, as the product evolves to meet the changing needs of the target market. Fixating on PMF as the sole metric can limit product managers from understanding the complexity of the ecosystem and hinder progress.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article argues that the concept of product-market fit is often misunderstood. It suggests that many mediocre products can still sell and make money with enough sales effort. Product-market fit is not simply about finding someone who wants to buy a product or having satisfied customers. Instead, it refers to having a product that fills a deep need in the market and leads to exponential growth. This is achieved when a self-reinforcing loop is created, such as a viral app or a platform where users generate content, making the platform better and attracting more users. The article points out that most businesses and startups do not have this kind of product-market fit, but those that do can achieve significant success. Startup investors often focus on product-market fit, network effects, and viral growth.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article argues against the existence of Product Market Fit (PMF) or claims that it is unclear when it is achieved. It also suggests that even if PMF is achieved, it does not guarantee success. The author expresses skepticism towards arguments presented in this structured manner and compares it to people promoting vegan diets. However, the author also acknowledges their personal experience of achieving PMF at a startup, leading to increased sales and usage. They mention that PMF is a useful framework to evaluate a product's value proposition and suggests taking feedback from the market to determine if there is a demand for the product.
