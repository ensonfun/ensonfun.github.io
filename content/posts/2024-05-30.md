### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience running a multi-million dollar non-profit while also having a full-time job. They explain that it is common for individuals to both chair a non-profit and work a regular job since non-profits are typically structured to allow for this balance. However, if the non-profit were to transition into a for-profit enterprise, the author states that they would have had to choose between the two. They mention that if the non-profit had commercialized a specific service, they would have likely quit their full-time job to focus on it. The author admits uncertainty about whether they would have proactively quit one or the other, and suggests that depending on the workload, they may have attempted to work both roles simultaneously for a period of time. They conclude by stating that they do not find a tweet by Paul relating to this situation to be strange.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author finds it strange that Paul G learned about OpenAI's for-profit arm through an announcement without seeking advice from Sam or Jessica. This aligns with Helen Toner's narrative that Paul kept the board uninformed, and they learned about things through announcements.

The author reflects on their generosity and how it can come back to them.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a common pattern in population dynamics where a system tolerates bad behavior up to a certain threshold before everyone switches to the bad behavior. This pattern can be observed in various situations such as line formation, traffic, stealing, and hoarding office supplies. The author provides personal anecdotal evidence of resorting to bad behavior in traffic and cutting lines when returning to their home country. The author expresses curiosity about what percentage of people engaging in bad behavior is needed for everyone to abandon the desired behavior.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In this article, the author recalls an incident at the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus in the 1980s. During that time, satirical parties often won student elections and engaged in peculiar actions, such as covering the campus with plastic flamingos. One satirical party became upset that the cafeteria only had three-tined forks, so they partnered with friends at Northwestern University to exchange their cafeteria's forks for UW's three-tined forks. Though successful in the trade, both universities' administrations were displeased and the exchange was eventually reversed.

## 3. [After 6 years, I'm over GraphQL](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40521518)

**Total comment counts : 119**

### Summary

 The author begins by expressing their initial enthusiasm for GraphQL and how it was a refreshing change from using untyped JSON REST APIs. However, as time went on and they encountered issues related to security, performance, and maintainability, their perspective on GraphQL changed. In this article, the author shares their reasons for not recommending GraphQL to most people and suggests alternative solutions. They discuss the increased attack surface of applications when using GraphQL due to the exposure of a query language to untrusted clients. They mention the need to properly authorize every field against the current user and highlight the challenge of handling large queries and estimating their complexity. The complexity estimation becomes even more difficult when dealing with cyclical schema graphs. The author also mentions the potential for denial-of-service attacks and discusses rate limiting as a mitigation strategy. They conclude by emphasizing the simplicity of rate limiting REST endpoints compared to GraphQL.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses disappointment and frustration with their experience implementing GraphQL. They feel that the permissions/authentication aspect is particularly difficult to manage and that it leads to performance issues. The author suggests that GraphQL may be more suitable for frontend developers who are not responsible for the backend. However, they still find it necessary to save queries as files or abstract them, making it similar to using REST endpoints. In hindsight, the author believes that writing REST endpoints would have been a better choice for their project.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience working on two GraphQL projects and how they were initially drawn to the hype but quickly became disillusioned. They found that as the projects progressed, the requirements became more complex and specific, leading to more time spent debugging. The author also noticed that both projects had signs of "learning-on-the-go" and had bad practices, particularly related to the N+1 problem. Issues were harder to find in logs and performance problems appeared in unexpected places. Interestingly, the original developers who set up the projects were no longer involved. The author concludes by stating that RPC and REST are easier to monitor, log, cache, authorize, and debug compared to GraphQL.

**Total comment counts : 38**

### Summary

 The article discusses how actors learn and remember their lines by focusing on deep understanding and meaning instead of rote repetition. They engage in elaborative rehearsal by studying the script, understanding their character, and relating their lines to that character. By asking goal-directed questions and analyzing the script, actors develop a deep understanding that allows them to recall lines naturally during performances. The article also mentions a septuagenarian actor who memorized all 10,565 lines of Milton's "Paradise Lost" through deep understanding and insight. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of deep understanding in enhancing memory and retention for everyday tasks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The Meisner Technique is a method of acting that emphasizes truthfulness and responding to the other actor. Instead of simply reciting lines, actors are encouraged to genuinely behave and engage with their scene partner. The technique helps actors get out of their heads and into their instincts. Warm-up exercises focus on the importance of responding to the other person in front of you, which also enhances communication skills in everyday life. Remembering lines becomes easier with the presence of another person, as it establishes a connection that aids memory recall.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of deeply understanding material and developing a speaking or writing style in order to effectively communicate. It mentions that these efforts are also crucial for actors.

The project already includes SVGO bundling, so the author suggests that adding SVGR bundling should not be a problem. The article provides links to the relevant GitHub pages for reference.

## 7. [Fast Shadow Stacks for Go](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40509535)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 The article discusses the potential benefits of software shadow stacks in improving stack trace capturing in the Go runtime. The author explains that capturing a stack trace involves traversing call frames on the stack and collecting return addresses. The traditional method of adding a pointer to the previous frame to each function has limitations, so alternative approaches like using DWARF or other unwind tables have been employed. However, the author introduces the concept of shadow stacks, which maintain a cache of return addresses to avoid duplicate work. One way to implement shadow stacks is by pushing return addresses to both the normal and shadow stacks. While hardware shadow stacks exist as a security feature for modern Intel CPUs, they are not accessible in user space. The article presents a potential alternative approach of populating a shadow stack during stack trace capture and using a trampoline function to manage return addresses. Overall, software shadow stacks offer potential improvements in stack trace capturing, but their widespread implementation and availability are still limited.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that in an ideal situation, an ABI (Application Binary Interface) should keep code and data in separate stacks. This would make profiling easier because profiling could then be done by simply copying the code stack.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses accessing stacks from userspace using a tool called ShadowStackWalk, which can be found on GitHub.
