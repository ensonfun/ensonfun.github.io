Feature flags, which are checked frequently during requests, may benefit from local SQLite databases due to their complex query requirements and the tolerance for delays in updates.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the performance characteristics of Redis, particularly in relation to read/write latencies, which scale linearly with the number of queried keys. The author reflects on their experience using Redis alongside Postgres in a monolithic application, noting that while it was easier to add new features in Redis, its single-threaded nature can lead to slowdowns if a feature performs bulk reads (e.g., 100K+ keys). 

They suggest that Redis is effective for operations involving single keys or small sets of keys. The author speculates that Redis excels at simple key lookups, such as for IP addresses, but may struggle with more complex queries, contrasting this with the performance of SQLite. Overall, the piece highlights Redis's strengths and weaknesses, and presents unexpected findings regarding SQLite's performance compared to Redis.
