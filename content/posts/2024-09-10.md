## 1. [Radiology-specific foundation model](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41496699)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article introduces Harrison.rad.1, a cutting-edge radiology-specific foundational model. This model performs exceptionally well in radiology exams and outperforms other foundational models in benchmarks. The Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists' 2B Rapids exam, known for its difficulty, sees a pass rate of only 40-59% for human radiologists on their first attempt. In comparison, Harrison.rad.1 scored 85.67% on this exam. Other competing models scored much lower, below 30, which is statistically no better than random guessing. Harrison.rad.1 offers revolutionary capabilities and has the potential to improve clinical excellence and quality in global healthcare. The model is specialized and fine-tuned for healthcare data, ensuring accuracy and clinical usefulness. The goal is to create more capacity in radiology through this technology. The article invites collaborators to gain early access to Harrison.rad.1 and be a part of the conversation on its responsible integration into clinical practice.

 The author believes that the reason the general public cannot access a certain technology is due to greed and a lack of understanding. They suggest that allowing public access, with a strong disclaimer, could help many people and generate revenue through subscriptions and analysis fees. The author also suggests integrating a directory or referral service for medical professionals. They hope that non-profit organizations will recognize the potential of this model and collaborate to create an open dataset, possibly by recruiting volunteers or offering waivers and discounts to medical providers. Though challenging, the author believes it would be worthwhile.

 The author had an MRI on their ankle and despite having painful symptoms, the doctor initially said there was nothing wrong. The author requested the MRI images and received a CD in the mail with a formal diagnosis of a swollen retrocalcaneal bursa. The author believes that if they hadn't requested their records, they wouldn't have received a diagnosis. They eventually found treatments online and got better. The author wonders if an AI model would have been able to detect the issue better than the doctor.

## 2. [Apple must pay 13B euros in back taxes, EU's top court rules](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41498358)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 The European Court of Justice has ruled against Apple in a 10-year court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland. The case began in 2016 when the European Commission ordered Ireland to recover €13 billion ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple. Apple has stated that it will incur a one-time income tax charge of about $10 billion in its fourth fiscal quarter ending September 2024. The Irish government has said that it will now transfer the assets in the escrow fund to Ireland. Apple claims that it has always paid the taxes it owes and that the European Commission is retroactively changing the rules.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that taxation is not within the jurisdiction of the European Union (EU), meaning that Ireland has the ability to set its own tax levels without interference. However, the issue at hand is whether Ireland applied the same tax rules to all companies, as offering special exceptions to certain companies could be seen as providing state aid, which is prohibited. Ireland argued that it did not provide such exceptions, but the current ruling contradicts this claim. It is important to note that this case pertains to tax rules from the past and that the rules have since been tightened, eliminating the previous exemption.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The reason Apple lost the tax case is not due to the profit shifting scheme itself, but because they did not set up the scheme correctly. Apple used two separate branches within a single Irish company instead of two separate Irish companies like the traditional Double Irish structure. The European Commission alleged that this "branch structure" was illegal state aid since it was not offered to other multinationals in Ireland. If Apple had set up two separate Irish companies, their tax scheme would have been legal and not considered state aid.

## 3. [A good day to trie-hard: saving compute 1% at a time](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41501496)

### Summary

 Cloudflare has announced the release of a new open-source Rust crate that helps reduce CPU utilization and allows their CDN to handle more web traffic. One of the services responsible for transmitting non-cached requests needed optimization, as it was consuming over 1.7% of CPU time. By benchmarking and optimizing code, Cloudflare was able to improve the function's runtime from 3.65µs to 1.53µs, resulting in a 2.39x speed improvement. However, further optimization is still needed. Cloudflare also explored using different data structures to store header names, with the goal of improving performance.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Cloudflare stores and removes internal headers. The author suggests various options that they would have considered, such as using a separate dictionary or a single header for internal metadata. However, the author finds it surprising that Cloudflare uses a scheme where headers in a particular list are considered internal. They raise concerns about potential issues with this approach, such as conflicts with other names, forgetting to sanitize, disagreements between simultaneously running programs, and slow set-difference algorithms. The author concludes by expressing their bewilderment that a company of Cloudflare's scale would use such a tedious and error-prone mechanism internally.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the effectiveness of mapping UTF8 characters into a bitmask. It mentions that using 32 bits could accommodate lowercase letters and six special characters, while 64 bits could accommodate uppercase letters and six more special characters. This approach allows for efficient matching algorithms and is reminiscent of older optimization techniques like Bloom Filters. The author points out that computing was more resource-constrained when these techniques were developed and notes that they are still applicable in certain real-world scenarios.

## 6. [DOJ claims Google has "trifecta of monopolies" on Day 1 of ad tech trial](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41496254)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has started a new trial against Google, challenging the tech giant's ad tech dominance. The DOJ argues that Google broke competition in the ad tech space by seizing control of tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers. According to the DOJ, Google takes at least 30 cents of each advertising dollar, resulting in website creators earning less and advertisers paying more. The trial is expected to last four to six weeks and could potentially result in the divestment of Google's Ad Manager suite of services. This trial is seen as more consequential than previous monopoly trials Google has faced, as the remedies sought by the DOJ in other cases were unclear. If the case goes against Google, it could potentially lead to the splitting of the company into separate search and advertising companies. The DOJ aims to restore competition by enjoining Google's anticompetitive practices and unwinding its anticompetitive acquisitions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a lawsuit against an adtech giant, noting that the case focuses on its monopolistic practices and harm to publishers, rather than its privacy violations and harm to society. The article criticizes the fact that the lawsuit only briefly mentions the detrimental societal effects, such as the diminishing availability of local newspapers. It argues that advertising has corrupted various forms of media and has played a significant role in the decline of journalism. The article also mentions that Google has accused the Department of Justice (DOJ) of having an outdated view of the ad tech market. The author finds this claim ironic, given that adtech companies have kept their practices hidden and the general public uninformed about data collection and monetization.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Google recently published a blog post cautioning against breaking up its ad business, as it may disturb customers who find its ad technology "simple, affordable, and effective." The writer questions the validity of this claim, stating that in past instances of monopolies being dismantled, it has generally proven beneficial for customers.
