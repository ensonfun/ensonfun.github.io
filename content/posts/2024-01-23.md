## 1. [FTC bans TurboTax from advertising 'free' services, calls deceptive advertising](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39097356)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has ruled that TurboTax, a popular tax filing software, engaged in deceptive advertising and has banned the company from advertising its services as free unless it is free for all customers. The FTC found that TurboTax's ads for "free" tax services misled customers who did not qualify for the free service, such as those with gig economy income or farm income. The FTC Administrative Law Judge announced the initial decision in September, which was upheld by the commission. Intuit, the owner of TurboTax, has appealed the decision outside of the FTC. As part of the ruling, Intuit cannot market any goods or services as free unless it truly is free for all customers and must clearly disclose the percentage of customers that actually qualify for the free service. The FTC also ordered Intuit to disclose all terms, conditions, and obligations required to obtain the "free" service and prohibited the company from misrepresenting any material facts about its products or services. This ruling comes after a 2019 ProPublica report that accused TurboTax of steering eligible clients away from free tax-filing services.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a TurboTax ad where a person is happy to discover that roughly 37% of taxpayers qualify for something. The author finds the commercial funny because 37% seems like a small percentage and TurboTax is presenting it as if it is a majority. The author also notes that this is one of the few times they have seen a company embrace the negatives in their fine print and openly acknowledge it as a positive.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a decision made by a Commission that is accused of being biased and broken. The Commission acts as an accuser, judge, and jury in a case, followed by serving as an appellate judge. However, this argument is seen as a distraction from the fact that the company lied in their advertising. The Commission suggests that the company should disclose the percentage of customers who actually qualify for the free service, which contradicts the claim they advertised. The company may attempt to work around this issue by featuring a character in their advertisement who receives the service for free.

## 2. [Backlog size is inversely proportional to how often we talk to customers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39081876)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The author of the article reflects on their experience running a venture that provides event and ticket management services for comics. They emphasize the importance of involving customers in the development process to create value and avoid making assumptions. They recommend focusing on building features based on customer input rather than spending excessive time planning and designing UIs. The author also highlights the significance of observing how customers use the app and implementing their feedback to improve it. They suggest investing in account spoofing to effectively test and diagnose issues in the production environment. Additionally, the article mentions the importance of presenting relevant and concise information to customers on the first page of the app.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that organizing possible features and improvements in a structured way is crucial. Rather than throwing every idea into a ticket, it is recommended to have tickets that have a chance of being completed in the near future, while storing other ideas elsewhere. This approach helps to avoid creating a giant backlog of tasks that will never be addressed. The author believes that this backlog is a sign of weak project managers who are hesitant to reject ideas and prefer to generate tickets as a default response.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the size of the backlog in a company is directly related to the turnover of project managers. For experienced project managers, the backlog represents past discussions and unfulfilled tasks. However, new project managers may view the backlog negatively and want to clear it entirely as they may not understand its purpose.

**Total comment counts : 101**

### Summary

 The author discusses the need for configuration management in Kubernetes and questions why YAML is being used for templating instead of generating JSON. They explain that as the complexity of managing applications and infrastructure increases, templating YAML becomes complicated and unwieldy. The author argues that tools like CloudFormation and Helm have made things more difficult by requiring convoluted syntax and forcing strict whitespace rules. They advocate for generating configuration files instead of manually writing them in order to simplify the process.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses frustration with configuration files written in YAML, stating that they are the worst part of Github Actions. They also dislike proprietary configuration languages such as HCL for Terraform and ASL for AWS Step Functions. The author prefers generating configuration programmatically, citing the AWS CDK as an example of a superior experience where configuration is written in a type-safe language with good IDE support.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is in favor of using real programming languages instead of YAML templating. They suggest using programming languages like Ruby or Python to handle complex logic and generate the desired output format (such as YAML or JSON). The author argues that using real programming languages instead of pseudo-languages like Jsonnet or Go templates would eliminate obscure issues and lead to a better experience.

## 9. [Forging signed commits on GitHub](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39086334)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article discusses a bug in an internal GitHub API that allowed the author of a commit to be forged. The bug was found by exploiting the fact that the API checked the authenticity of the author line in a commit using a regular expression that did not account for zero-length names. By creating a commit with a zero-length name for the first author line, it was possible to trick GitHub into signing the commit as any user. The bug was fixed by changing the regular expression to account for zero-length names.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes a vulnerability in GitHub Codespaces that allows users to create GitHub-signed commits with any author name and email. This is possible because Codespaces looks at the second author line while Git looks at the first, resulting in a desynchronization and different states between the two parsers.
