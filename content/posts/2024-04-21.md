## 1. [Programming Is Mostly Thinking (2014)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40103407)

**Total comment counts : 65**

### Summary

 This person is expressing agreement with a blog post about Tim Ottinger's thoughts on software development. They mention that there are various things and artifacts that can be produced to ensure quality, such as literate coding, commenting code before writing, and using data modeling and UML diagrams.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article disagrees with the quote that says "Really good developers do 90% or more of the work before they ever touch the keyboard." They argue that most people can't keep all the necessary information in their head and that the amount of pure thinking without writing anything is limited. The author's solution is to start writing code almost immediately when they have possible solutions to a problem, instead of fully developing them into a well-specified design. They believe that many times, what they initially thought was the best solution turned out to be worse than a less promising one. They suggest that putting ideas into code helps to better understand the consequences they have on the final product. The author sees this approach as part of the thinking process and compares it to software prototyping or throwing away the first iteration.

 The article discusses the two-step process of computer programming: understanding the universe and explaining it to a three-year-old. The first step emphasizes the importance of learning as much as possible about various subjects, as solutions to problems can come from unexpected places. The second step involves communicating information to a computer, which has a rigid view of the world, similar to a young child. The article highlights the need for flexibility and the ability to make inferences in programming, as computers do not possess these skills.

## 9. [Racket Language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40102912)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the features and capabilities of the Racket programming language. Racket is a mature and stable language that supports cross-platform graphical programming. It includes a rich set of libraries for various purposes, such as web server apps and mathematics. Racket allows programmers to define their own loops using powerful macros and even create domain-specific languages. It is the first language to support higher-order software contracts and safe gradual typing. Racket comes with support for major editors and provides an innovative and extensible interactive development environment. The language also allows programmers to add new syntactic constructs through macros. The article provides an example of defining a new syntax for measuring the time a task takes. Racket offers a comprehensive suite of libraries, including a cross-platform GUI toolbox and a web server. Thousands of additional packages are available with a single command. Racket's macro system allows developers to create co-operating macros for implementing various functionalities. The language combines functional programming with object-oriented components. Racket is known for its ability to create new languages on the fly, with no setup or external tools required. The article highlights Racket's own IDE, DrRacket, which supports alternative languages and provides useful features like identifying where an identifier was defined. Racket's syntax is flexible, allowing developers to build languages with conventional surface syntax or parenthetical languages. Racket's ecosystem also provides parsing packages for mapping any syntax to a parenthesized language.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses joy about Racket's popularity. They have used Common Lisp for research programming for a long time but now prefer Racket. They mention that they dislike most parts of Racket except the compiler, package management system, GUI IDE, Emacs bindings, and find it a fun language to use. They also mention not caring for the programming language research aspects of Racket and feel like a freeloader on the project. However, they have contributed a book about Racket.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author likes the Racket programming language, but finds the workflow it imposes to be challenging. Unlike Python where they write code in an editor and run it from the shell, Racket takes too long to start that way. Instead, the recommended approach is to interact with a long-running virtual machine (vm) through a REPL. However, this means that the code being worked on doesn't start with a clean slate, but rather with the state the vm is currently in. The author believes this workflow is suitable for things like Jupyter notebooks, but not ideal for larger programs in their opinion.
