## 2. [Is the world becoming uninsurable?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42732728)

**Total comment counts : 100**

### Summary

 The article discusses the growing issue of insurability in the face of increasing natural disasters, particularly focusing on the author's personal experience with hurricane insurance and broader trends affecting insurance globally. Here are the key points:

1. **Rising Global Risks**: The author notes an increase in global risks, particularly from climate change, which is making parts of the world potentially "uninsurable" as insurance companies face rising costs due to frequent and severe weather events.

2. **Insurance Industry Response**: Insurers are responding to these heightened risks by withdrawing from high-risk areas, reducing coverage, and increasing premiums. This is evident in places like California where wildfires have led to significant insurer pullbacks.

3. **Political vs. Real-World Solutions**: The article critiques the common political approach to these issues, which often involves forcing insurers to provide coverage or having the government act as an "insurer of last resort." However, these solutions do not address the root problem of increasing risks and only transfer the financial burden.

4. **California's Example**: In California, legislative measures like a moratorium on policy cancellations in fire zones show attempts to mitigate the immediate impact on homeowners. However, the state-run FAIR plan, meant to be an insurer of last resort, is nearing insolvency due to the increased frequency and severity of wildfires.

5. **Systemic Risks**: The article warns about the systemic risks where transferring losses to the government or the broader economy could lead to systemic failure if not managed properly. The idea of an "insurer of last resort" might not be sustainable as it assumes an unlimited financial capacity to cover all potential losses.

6. **Future Concerns**: There's a looming question about the sustainability of rebuilding in high-risk areas, especially if taxpayer money is used to subsidize such rebuilding efforts without addressing why these areas are becoming uninsurable in the first place.

The piece ends abruptly, but the overall theme suggests a need for a deeper understanding and perhaps a rethinking of how society manages and responds to escalating climate risks beyond mere political or technological fixes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses concerns about insurability in disaster-prone areas, specifically mentioning the situation in the United States where natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires are common. The author notes that while some regions face significant risks making them potentially "uninsurable," this is not a global issue as other parts of the world do not face similar threats or construction practices that exacerbate these risks.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the evolution of building materials in response to natural disasters, using historical and personal examples. After the Great Chicago Fire, the city switched from wood to brick construction to prevent future fires. However, the author points out that brick buildings aren't resistant to earthquakes unless reinforced with steel. The author lives in a house built in 1950 by a commercial builder, made of steel-reinforced cinder block and concrete, which withstood the 1989 earthquake. This type of construction, while effective, isn't popular in modern U.S. residential architecture due to aesthetic and possibly other preferences.

## 3. [Supreme Court upholds TikTok ban, but Trump might offer lifeline](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738464)

**Total comment counts : 128**

### Summary

 The Supreme Court has upheld a law that requires ByteDance, the China-based owner of TikTok, to divest its ownership of the app by Sunday or face a potential ban in the U.S. ByteDance has not agreed to sell, which means U.S. TikTok users might lose access to the app this weekend, although existing installations might still function. The decision supports the "Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act," which addresses national security concerns related to TikTok's data practices and its ties to China. President-elect Donald Trump, who previously supported banning TikTok but has since changed his stance, will have the final say post-inauguration. Trump has asked for time to review the situation and has hinted at working towards a political resolution. Meanwhile, TikTok's CEO has expressed optimism about finding a solution with the incoming administration.

 The article discusses a cyber conflict between the U.S. and China, where China is accused of hacking major U.S. telecommunications companies and regulatory bodies, including the Treasury Department. The hacks were allegedly used to collect geolocation data and to spy on Americans by exploiting wiretap capabilities. Despite these actions, there is debate about whether to allow Chinese companies to install apps on American phones, with the suggestion that public awareness might be low due to platforms like TikTok possibly suppressing related news stories.

## 4. [Bypassing disk encryption on systems with automatic TPM2 unlock](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42733640)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 **Summary:**

The article discusses vulnerabilities in disk unlocking systems using TPM2 (Trusted Platform Module) with tools like `systemd-cryptenroll` and `clevis`. Here are the key points:

1. **Vulnerability**: Many setups that use TPM2 for disk decryption are susceptible to a "filesystem confusion attack." An attacker with brief physical access (around 10 minutes) can decrypt the disk by:
   - Analyzing the initrd (initial RAM disk) which resides on an unencrypted boot partition to understand the decryption process.
   - Creating a fake LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) partition with a known key that mimics the original partition's structure, thereby tricking the system into executing malicious code during boot.

2. **Attack Mechanism**: The attack involves:
   - Identifying how the initrd decrypts the disk and the expected filesystem type.
   - Recreating the LUKS partition with a known key, which does not alter the TPM state, allowing the attacker to unseal the original key from the TPM.
   - Restoring the original disk state and decrypting it with the obtained key.

3. **Security Measures**: Systems are secure if:
   - A PIN is used in addition to TPM for unlocking, or
   - The initrd is configured to verify the LUKS identity of the decrypted partition, which typically involves manual configuration.

4. **TPM2 Disk Decryption Concept**: 
   - The TPM stores a LUKS key, which can only be retrieved if the system's state, as recorded in PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers), matches a known-good state from when the key was enrolled.
   - PCRs are updated during boot to reflect the state of various system components, ensuring a chain of trust.

5. **Best Practices**: 
   - Binding encrypted volumes to PCRs 7, 11, and 14 is recommended for updates. Binding to PCRs 0 and 2 can be problematic due to frequent changes with firmware or OS updates.
   - Using only PCR 7 might suffice for integrity if custom secure boot keys and a Unified Kernel Image are used.

The article emphasizes the importance of understanding and securing the TPM-based disk unlocking mechanisms to prevent such vulnerabilities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's initial enthusiasm and subsequent disappointment with the implementation of Trusted Platform Module (TPM)-based Full Disk Encryption (FDE) on Linux by systemd. Initially, the author was excited as this seemed like a step towards simplifying encryption, similar to BitLocker on Windows or FileVault on macOS, where FDE is straightforward to enable and use. However, upon delving into the specifics of how it's implemented, the author found the process to be overly complex, filled with numerous steps and potential vulnerabilities. The author feels that the process should be much simpler, ideally involving just a few secure steps to ensure a secure boot and login environment.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a configuration for enhancing security on a system using Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0:

1. **Configuration**: The author modified the `/etc/crypttab.initramfs` file by adding `tpm2-measure-pcr=yes` to enable PCR (Platform Configuration Registers) measurement for the TPM.

2. **Enrollment**: They used `systemd-cryptenroll` with specific parameters to bind the encryption key to certain PCRs (0, 2, 7, and 15) with a hash value of all zeros for SHA-256.

3. **Security Measure**: Upon decrypting a volume, the `initrd` (initial RAM disk) writes the `volume-key` to PCR 15. This action ensures that once the volume is decrypted, any subsequent executables cannot retrieve or use the key from the TPM, thereby securing the data against unauthorized access.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with the "Masking Views" functionality in a Rails application, highlighting several issues:

1. **Conventional Challenges**: Using 'Masking Views' goes against typical conventions in Rails, making it cumbersome, especially in environments with database schema migrations.

2. **Implementation Issues**: At the author's former employer, this functionality was isolated from the development team, likely for segmentation reasons. This separation meant that necessary schema changes for tables containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) were overlooked.

3. **Environment Discrepancy**: The functionality was only implemented in the production database, not in development, testing, or staging environments. This led to:
   - Inability to test or catch migration issues before deployment.
   - Releases often failing, requiring manual intervention by the operations team to temporarily remove and then recreate the views during updates.

4. **Recommendations**: 
   - Ensure the extension and its views are uniformly set up across all environments (development, testing, staging, and production).
   - Integrate the initialization and creation of views into the framework's database migration process for better documentation and reproducibility in new environments.

Overall, the author advises caution and careful planning when implementing 'Masking Views' in environments with dynamic schema changes to avoid operational and release issues.

1. **Shift in Direction**: The author mentions that their project, Nue, is shifting to become a standards-first web framework, focusing on leveraging modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly rather than through heavy abstractions.

2. **Critique of Modern Frameworks**: The author critiques the modern era of web development for moving away from web standards, leading to over-complicated applications with excessive dependencies, even for simple tasks. This complexity not only slows down development but also creates a cultural shift where developers spend more time learning frameworks than solving actual user problems.

3. **Loss of Design Focus**: There's a lament over how JavaScript-centric development has overshadowed design principles. The author points out that the focus on technical aspects like type safety and JavaScript optimization has led to a neglect of systematic design approaches, causing a disconnect between designers and developers.

4. **Technical Debt**: The constant evolution of frameworks leads to accumulating technical debt in developers' knowledge, as patterns and best practices change rapidly.

5. **Proposed Solution**: The author advocates for:
   - **Standards First**: Utilizing the advancements in browser technology to build with less code.
   - **HTML First**: Using semantic HTML as the base for all web structures, enhancing accessibility and SEO.
   - **Content First**: Employing Markdown for content which keeps it separate from the logic.
   - **Design Systems**: Emphasizing modern CSS capabilities for systematic design, which can lead to cleaner, more maintainable interfaces.

6. **Benefits of the Proposed Approach**: This approach promises faster development cycles, cleaner code without the need for extensive JavaScript or state management, and significantly faster page loads since the content is delivered without the overhead of framework initialization.

In summary, the article calls for a return to web development fundamentals, focusing on web standards and design principles to create more efficient, maintainable, and user-centric web applications.

## 8. [The Family Bass - Music with an NES](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42735413)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses a custom technical project where the author modified a Family BASIC keyboard to interface with a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) through a controller port, rather than its intended Famicom expansion port. Here's a summary:

- **Setup**: The Family BASIC keyboard uses a 9x8 key matrix, with an additional blank row for cycling, controlled by a 4017 decade-counter chip. This setup differs significantly from the NES's standard controller protocol which uses a shift register for button states.

- **Custom Adapter**: A custom adapter was necessary because the NES controller ports only provide limited signals (OUT, CLK, and one data line), not directly compatible with the keyboard's needs. The author connected the NES's OUT line to the keyboard's row selection and clock line.

- **Microcontroller Integration**: An AVR ATtiny85 microcontroller was used to manage the data transfer. It converts the parallel data from the keyboard into a serial-like bitstream that the NES can interpret, despite the NES not being designed for such an interface.

- **Signal Timing and Software**: The ATtiny85 was programmed in assembly to ensure precise timing of data transmission, with each bit lasting 6 microseconds. On the NES side, software had to be developed to interpret this bitstream, dealing with signal timing and synchronization issues.

- **Performance and Presentation**: The project was completed to allow live performance of music using the NES's unique sound capabilities, showcasing the technical setup in a video presentation and a live performance of an original tune.

This project highlights the ingenuity involved in adapting hardware for creative uses beyond their original design, focusing on the technical challenges and solutions in interfacing different electronic systems.

## 9. [Issues with Color Spaces and Perceptual Brightness](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734851)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of the CIELAB color space, particularly its inability to accurately represent the perceived brightness of colors due to the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect. Here are the key points:

1. **Perceptual Uniformity**: CIELAB aims to be perceptually uniform, meaning numerical changes in its values should correspond to perceived changes in color by humans. However, this isn't always the case.

2. **Helmholtz-Kohlrausch Effect**: This effect describes how highly saturated colors, like red, appear brighter than their lightness value in CIELAB would suggest. For example, a red with the same L value (lightness) as other colors seems much brighter.

3. **Modeling Efforts**: Recent research has been trying to model this effect more accurately by introducing concepts like "Predicted Equivalent Achromatic Lightness" (L_EAL), which provides a better estimation of perceived lightness for use in applications like image desaturation.

4. **Practical Application**: The author has experienced issues with CIELAB when desaturating game screenshots for evaluating art assets. Reds appeared darker than they should, which could mislead designers in adjusting the brightness of red assets.

5. **Search for Better Models**: The author notes a lack of readily available color spaces that account for the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect in their standard calculations, expressing a desire for such models.

6. **Conclusion**: The article highlights the discrepancies between theoretical models of color perception and actual human perception, particularly with vivid colors, and the ongoing efforts to refine these models for more accurate applications in digital media.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses several interesting aspects of human auditory perception:

1. **Logarithmic vs. Linear Perception**: Sound pressure is measured logarithmically (in decibels), where every 3dB represents a doubling of sound pressure, but human hearing perceives these changes on a linear scale, making higher volumes seem less impactful when adjusted linearly.

2. **Volume and Frequency Range**: At lower volumes, the range of audible frequencies narrows, focusing more on midrange sounds. The concept of "loudness" attempts to correct this by adjusting the audio output to compensate, although it's often misunderstood as simply boosting bass and treble.

3. **Frequency Response**: Instead of aiming for a flat frequency response, which might seem logical for even sound reproduction, the Harman curve provides a more natural listening experience by shaping the sound in a way that's pleasing to human ears.

4. **Directionality of Bass**: Bass frequencies below about 110Hz are omnidirectional, meaning they do not help in locating the source of the sound. This property is utilized in audio setups where subwoofers can be placed out of sight yet still provide the sensation that bass is emanating from the main speakers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses **tone mapping** in high dynamic range (HDR) rendering, a technique used in video games like Cyberpunk 2077 to manage the transition between different lighting conditions:

- **HDR Rendering:** Pixels are initially computed with a high range of values (up to 16 bits or floating-point numbers) which exceed what typical screens can display. These values are then transformed into a displayable format through tone mapping.

- **Eye Adaptation Simulation:** When moving from dark to bright environments, or vice versa, there's a delay in how the human eye adjusts to light changes. Games simulate this by making the screen blindingly bright or overly dark initially, then gradually adjusting.

- **Tone Mapping Challenges:** Beyond mere intensity adjustments, tone mapping must account for the human eye's varying sensitivity to different colors. This technique also has to balance visual realism with user comfort, as some visually impaired individuals find these adjustments disorienting or uncomfortable.

- **Example from Cyberpunk 2077:** A video clip is referenced where the game's environment changes from a dark tunnel to bright daylight, demonstrating how the screen's brightness adapts to simulate eye adjustment.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The provided URL links to a Hacker News discussion thread about the importance of code duplication in software development. Here's a summary of the key points discussed:

- **Code Duplication as a Tool**: The discussion highlights that code duplication isn't always negative. Sometimes, duplicating code can be beneficial for clarity, reducing complexity, or when the duplicated code serves different purposes or has different future maintenance needs.

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle Critique**: There's a critique of the DRY principle, suggesting that while it's good to avoid unnecessary duplication, blindly adhering to DRY can lead to overly complex or abstracted code which might be harder to maintain or understand.

- **Contextual Duplication**: Participants in the thread argue that sometimes duplication is necessary due to different contexts or requirements, even if the code looks similar at first glance.

- **Refactoring**: The discussion touches on when and how to refactor duplicated code, indicating that sometimes it's better to leave things as they are if the abstraction to avoid duplication would complicate the codebase.

- **Software Design**: There's an emphasis on thoughtful software design where duplication might be a sign of deeper architectural issues, but not necessarily a problem that needs immediate solving.

This thread essentially debates the nuanced approach to code duplication, suggesting that while it's often seen as bad practice, there are scenarios where it makes sense or even adds value to the codebase.
