## 2. [How a startup loses its spark](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37098483)

**Total comment counts : 41**

### Summary

 The author discusses why engineers often find working at a seed stage startup "intoxicating" compared to larger companies. They explain that the fun and enjoyable aspects of working at a startup diminish as the company scales and more employees are added. They argue that this is inevitable due to the nature of growth and increasing user demands. However, the author suggests strategies to slow down the loss of fun, such as avoiding the acceleration of corporatization by emulating larger companies' processes. They propose that large companies should instead try to operate more like startups. Additionally, the author advises cleverly designing incentives and hiring at a slower pace to mitigate scaling challenges. They also mention that as tools and technology improve, future founders may not face the same scaling pains, leading to a more enjoyable work experience for everyone.

 The article praises Netflix's approach 10 years ago when they hired experienced individuals and eliminated unnecessary processes. This resulted in a culture where things happened naturally and non-events were expected. Examples include the quick implementation of active-active regions, the development of an easy deployment tool called Asgard, and the transition away from the monolithic Tomcat app. Engineers had minimal meetings and were given the freedom to be productive. The managers and directors took on the responsibility of setting the right context for the team.

## 4. [80% of bosses say they regret earlier return-to-office plans](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37093854)

**Total comment counts : 61**

### Summary

 According to new research from Envoy, 80% of bosses regret their initial decisions to bring employees back to the office and say they would have approached their plans differently if they had a better understanding of what their employees wanted. The study interviewed over 1,000 U.S. company executives and workplace managers, who expressed challenges in measuring the success of in-office policies and making long-term real estate investments without knowing how employees might feel about returning to the office. Some business leaders are backtracking on earlier pledges to allow employees to work from home, while others are requiring employees to spend more time at the office, citing the need for in-person collaboration. The sunk cost of unused office space has been a major factor in companies' decisions to change their return-to-office approach. Companies that put pressure on employees to return to the office without seeking employee input are more likely to experience turnover issues. On the other hand, companies that involve employees in decision-making are seeing more success in returning to the office. For example, Ernst & Young rolled out a fund to reimburse commuting, pet care, and dependent care costs for its employees, resulting in a 150% increase in office attendance since the benefit was introduced. It is expected to take at least another year or two for companies to settle into an office routine that both employees and bosses are content with.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the author's view on the guilt tripping used by employers regarding remote work. The author argues that some employers have a misconception of lazy remote workers and an inflated sense of the importance of their workplace. They argue that the majority of jobs are not people's passions and do not have the potential to make a significant impact. The author dismisses the idea that remote work is bad because employees cannot interact with colleagues and engage in deep work, stating that it is an overvaluation of the company's importance. They believe that companies that truly make a difference are the minority and smart employers would recognize the benefits of a hybrid work policy.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that some leaders are finding it challenging to measure the success of in-office policies and make long-term real estate investments without knowing how employees will feel about returning to the office in the future. It also highlights that the objections to return-to-office policies, such as productivity and employee opinions, were valid and could have been avoided with a brief moment of reflection. However, the article notes a positive aspect that 80% of executives admitted they could have done a better job, which is surprising considering the common belief that they would claim flawless execution.

## 8. [tRPC – Build and consume typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37098875)

**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 The article discusses the benefits and features of using tRPC, a tool that boosts productivity for full-stack applications using TypeScript inference. It highlights that TypeScript provides warnings for errors before saving the file, eliminating the need for build or compile steps. tRPC is compatible with various JavaScript frameworks and runtimes, and can be easily integrated into existing projects. The tool has zero dependencies and a small client-side footprint, making it lightweight. It offers adapters for popular frameworks and platforms. The article also explains the steps to create a tRPC API, set up an HTTP server, and create a client for querying data. Overall, tRPC aims to remove the need for a traditional API-layer while maintaining code integrity during rapid iteration. The article concludes by mentioning positive feedback from developers and expressing gratitude to sponsors.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is currently removing tRPC from their codebase. They describe it as a nightmare of tight coupling and mention that it discourages junior developers from considering interfaces and data access patterns. While it is useful for rapid prototyping, it becomes difficult to decouple the codebase later on.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Notion has been using an API style similar to tRPC for several years. It explains how to build this type of API using Typescript's mapped types, by creating an object type with API names as keys and request/response types as values. The server is structured to handle each API as a function, taking the appropriate request type and returning the corresponding response type. A client is then built to expose each API as an async function with the same arguments and return type. The article mentions that this strategy is used for Notion's internal API, real-time APIs, Electron-Webview APIs, and Native-Webview APIs. For native APIs, the server side is written in Swift or Kotlin, and the request and response types are manually rewritten from Typescript. The article also mentions the possibility of switching to a binary-based format with its own IDL in the future.
