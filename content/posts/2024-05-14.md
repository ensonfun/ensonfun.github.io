**Total comment counts : 62**

### Summary

 The article introduces Veo, a generative video model developed by Google. Veo is capable of generating high-quality, 1080p resolution videos in various cinematic styles. It accurately interprets prompts and offers creative control, allowing users to create cinematic effects like time lapses or aerial shots. Veo aims to make video production accessible to filmmakers, creators, and educators. Select creators can access some of Veo's features through the experimental tool VideoFX. Google plans to bring Veo's capabilities to YouTube Shorts and other products in the future. The model demonstrates advanced understanding of both text prompts and visual semantics. It can generate coherent videos by combining textual information with relevant visual references. Veo also supports video editing commands, such as adding elements to a scene, and masked editing for making changes to specific areas of a video. It can even generate videos based on both an image and a text prompt, following the style of the image. Veo is also capable of producing longer videos, up to and beyond 60 seconds, and can stitch together a sequence of prompts to tell a cohesive story. The model uses latent diffusion transformers to minimize inconsistencies and maintain visual consistency across frames. Veo builds on previous generative video model work and incorporates Google's Transformer architecture and Gemini. To enhance its accuracy, detailed captions have been added to the training data, and the model utilizes compressed representations of videos for efficiency.

 This article criticizes a video's lack of impressive clips compared to another one called "Sora." The author notes that while "Sora" had longer clips with a lot of rapid movement, the shots in this video are only a few seconds long and mostly feature slow motion or slow panning shots. The author suggests that these clips were chosen because they lack movement. The only clip that comes close to the quality of "Sora" is a cyberpunk video that is deemed inconsistent.

## 2. [A review on protein language models](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40350954)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the similarities between protein language and human language and explains how transformer models have been used to analyze protein data. Protein sequences, composed of amino acids, determine the structure and function of proteins. Proteins consist of motifs and domains, which are like words and phrases in human language. Like human language, protein language also has the concept of information completeness, meaning that a protein's structure is contained within its sequence. The article discusses the use of language models, such as BERT-like architectures and GPT-x models, in protein language modeling. These models are trained to generate protein sequences and have been used for various downstream tasks in protein engineering. The article also mentions the development of conditioned transformer language (CTRL) models, which allow targeted text generation without requiring input sequences. One example is ProGen, which achieved similar performance to high-quality English language models when generating protein sequences.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is excited about the potential of Alphafold and is interested in exploring a different approach to modeling proteins called ab-initio. They are curious about creating simulations of charge density around atoms to study protein folding using electric force models. The author mentions that current models used by chemists are computationally intense and may not scale well as the electron count increases. They express suspicion that reasonable models of charge density can be developed by solving the Schrodinger equation and incorporating various solutions. The integration of spin proves challenging, but the author believes there may be shortcuts that do not require exchange terms. Modeling electron-electron interaction is also difficult due to the feedback loop between different variables. The author acknowledges that this approach is both fringe and probably intractable, but still worth pursuing. They highlight the challenge of solving differential equations and suggest that the validation of solutions can be a valuable outcome. The author concludes by speculating on the connection between the rules of quantum mechanics and nature's preference for differential equations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a misconception about ISLisp. Back in the day, there was a belief that ISLisp limited the `cdr` fields of cons cells to only be `nil` or `cons`. However, this is not true, as even the 1997 draft of ISLisp does not support this claim. In fact, ISLisp requires all atoms to be considered as list terminators. It is documented that the `length` function in ISLisp returns 2 for `(length '(a b . c))`. The article concludes by questioning where this misconception originated from.

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 This article discusses the ancient Roman playwright, Plautus, and the challenges in understanding his life and work. Plautus was a famous comedic playwright in ancient Rome who lived and wrote in the late 200s and early 100s BCE. However, little is known about him personally, as theater was considered disreputable at the time and citizens were not allowed to become actors. Plautus only gained fame after his death, and even his name is believed to be a pen name. Many of his plays are reworkings of earlier works, and most of his plays are incomplete, with only fragments remaining. Additionally, ancient Roman humor differs greatly from modern humor, making it difficult to fully appreciate Plautus' comedic works. The article also includes a relatable passage from one of Plautus' fragments, in which a character complains about the tyranny of the clock. The author reflects on how the measurement of time has come to dominate and dictate our lives, both in terms of work and daily activities. Finally, the article mentions that the development of timekeeping machines will be explored in the following week's newsletter.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a few interesting facts. It mentions that a "stick" on a sundial is called a gnomon. It also explains that early hours were not uniform in length due to the use of sundials. The Babylonians and Egyptians divided the daylight into twelve equal regions and the time between sunset and dawn into twelve equal periods. However, these day and night hours were not the same length and varied between different days. The article also mentions that having a parasite was a kind of job in ancient times. If a person was rich, they would pay for someone to accompany them, showcasing their wealth and generosity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two lines of microarchitecture from Intel: the P6-derived line (Golden Cove, Redwood Cove) and the Atom-derived line (Gracemont, Crestmont). The author believes that the Atom-derived line is more interesting because it represents Intel's innovation and experimentation with new approaches. The author speculates that Intel may drop their P-Core line in the near future. The Gracemont cores are comparable to the Golden Cove cores in terms of performance on integer workloads, but they are smaller. If the FPU (floating-point unit) width is increased, the "mont" cores could have similar performance on FPU workloads. The "mont" uarch (microarchitecture) has an advantage over the "cove" uarch because of its clustered instruction decoding approach, which allows it to sustain six instructions per cycle. The Crestmont cores have improved this approach further by combining the instruction streams from two 3-wide instruction decoders, allowing them to match the performance of the "coves" with simpler decoders. Additionally, the Crestmont cores can handle one complex instruction every six instructions without needing a uop cache. The approach is scalable, meaning Intel could potentially add more instruction decode clusters to further increase performance.
