## 3. [Report Phone Spam â€“ Shut down robocallers and text spammers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38507446)

**Total comment counts : 54**

### Summary

 The article explains how to report abuse to a telecom carrier to have them terminate a spammer's service. It advises reporting the phone number that the spam call or text instructs you to contact, rather than the number that appears on Caller ID, as it is often spoofed. The article recommends using free websites or carrier lookup APIs to find the name of the telecom carrier responsible for the number. It emphasizes the importance of being professional and respectful when contacting the carrier. The article also suggests reporting the abuse to your own wireless provider and recommends ensuring that the carrier investigates the abuse and not just remove your number from the abuser's list. It distinguishes reporting abuse to the carrier from using "Report Junk" or "Block & report spam" buttons, noting that those reports go to your wireless provider or phone manufacturer, while reporting abuse to the carrier can lead to the spammer's phone number being shut off. The article mentions that blocking the number is not very effective because the originating phone number is often spoofed or constantly changing for text messages. It suggests using Twilio or Plivo APIs to discover the carrier routing the abusive number. Finally, the article mentions that the abusive messages could be Apple iMessages.

## 5. [Paper vs. devices: Brain activation differences during memory retrieval (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38513617)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 In this study, researchers investigated how different methods of encoding memory, such as using paper notebooks or mobile devices, affect retrieval processes. Three groups of participants were compared: one group used paper notebooks, another used electronic tablets, and the third used smartphones. After a retention period, participants were tested on their recognition memory using visually presented questions while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results showed that the Note group, which used paper notebooks, had shorter writing durations, higher accuracy in easier questions, and higher brain activations compared to the Tablet and Phone groups. These findings suggest that the use of paper notebooks promotes deeper and more solid cognitive processes during encoding, leading to better retrieval performance and increased activation in specific brain regions. The study also discussed previous research highlighting the benefits of longhand note-taking and the use of paper for conceptual understanding and reading comprehension. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that the utilization of paper notebooks enhances memory encoding and retrieval processes, particularly in the hippocampus for associating episodic and spatial information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that there is currently no control group of individuals who have solely used electronic devices throughout their lives. Despite the increasing use of tablets in schools, note taking and exams are still done on paper. This means that any future studies comparing paper and electronic methods will focus on individuals who have spent their formative years writing on paper. The article emphasizes that the ability to write on paper is important for entry into society, and any conclusion favoring paper over electronic methods should be considered with this caveat.

## 9. [A whale that's known only by the sound of its voice](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38506507)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses the discovery of an unknown species of beaked whale known as the Cross Seamount beaked whale. Scientists have been recording the sounds of this mysterious whale for 18 years, but its true identity remains uncertain. Some believe it could be a known species, while others think it may be a previously undiscovered species. Researchers recently analyzed nearly 20 years of recordings and have determined that the Cross Seamount beaked whale is a type of beaked whale, but its behavior differs from known species. Beaked whales are known for their stealthy nature and deep dives, often reaching depths of 3,000 meters. To further understand this whale, scientists rely on its calls, as beaked whales use echolocation to find prey. The researchers have discovered that the Cross Seamount beaked whale ranges from Guam to Mexico and predominantly echolocates at night. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior and habitat of this mysterious species.

### Summary

 Geneticist and chronobiologist Michael Rosbash, who recently won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on circadian rhythms, discussed his research in a recent interview. Rosbash explained that circadian rhythms are the 24-hour changes in our physiology that synchronize with the day-night cycle. He mentioned that not only humans, but also bacteria, plants, and insects like fruit flies have biological clocks. Rosbash also mentioned that recent research shows that at least 70% of our genes are regulated by circadian rhythms, compared to the previous estimate of 50%. He emphasized the importance of basic research and encouraged young researchers to pursue interesting projects. Rosbash also discussed the similarities between the circadian rhythms of fruit flies and humans and explained that studying flies helps understand general questions about brain science and behavior. When asked about the purpose of sleep, he admitted that it is still not fully understood but speculated it could be related to metabolic processes.
