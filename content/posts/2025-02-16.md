### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of continued fractions as an efficient way to represent both real and rational numbers. It mentions a historical skepticism about the possibility of performing arithmetic operations on continued fractions, which was later contradicted by Bill Gosper in 1972 when he demonstrated that arithmetic operations could indeed be performed perfectly with continued fractions. The author is developing a Python library named "reals" aimed at providing a drop-in replacement for Python's Decimal or Fraction types by implementing these arithmetic operations on continued fractions, although the library is still a work in progress and has encountered various challenges.

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 Archaeologists in London have discovered a significant part of the city's first basilica, dating back to about 80 AD, under an office building at 85 Gracechurch Street. This basilica was a key public building in Roman London, used for major political, economic, and administrative activities. The excavation revealed sections of the basilica's stone base, made from Kent limestone, and other artifacts like a stamped roof tile. The site, which was initially set for demolition and redevelopment, will now incorporate these historical remains into the new office design, allowing public access. This discovery provides insights into the early development of London and its role in Roman Britain. The find has necessitated adjustments in the architectural plans to preserve the archaeological site, reflecting a broader effort to integrate London's rich history with modern urban development.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a building in London which was constructed following the destruction caused by Boudica's revolt against Roman rule. The revolt was triggered when the Roman Emperor Nero ignored the will of Prasutagus, a Celtic king who had left his kingdom to be shared between his daughters and Nero upon his death. Instead, Romans took over the area, leading to the uprising by Boudica. The building mentioned is thus part of the "re-beginnings" of the city after this significant historical event.

## 10. [Product Development Processes You Might Not Have Heard of (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43038794)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article by Richard Holmes discusses alternatives to traditional project management methodologies like Scrum, focusing on two innovative approaches:

1. **ShapeUp**: 
   - **Shaping**: This phase involves designers, engineers, and product managers exploring potential solutions before committing to development. It emphasizes rough, not perfect, designs and setting boundaries on what features will be included or excluded.
   - **Betting Table**: Instead of maintaining a backlog, teams pitch ideas which are then "bet" on by stakeholders for investment. This method avoids the issue of endless backlogs by making immediate decisions on what to build.
   - **Building**: The development cycle lasts for 6 weeks, aiming to create fully functional, integrated features rather than partial functionalities that require later iterations. 

   ShapeUp is designed to allow for deeper work and more meaningful product development, avoiding the rush often seen in shorter sprint cycles.

2. **Plan, Build, Ship**: 
   - This methodology, inspired by but lighter than traditional Waterfall, involves:
     - **Plan**: Outlining the feature or project scope.
     - **Build**: Developing the feature.
     - **Ship**: Releasing the feature to the market.
   - It's a streamlined version of waterfall where each feature is managed from conception to delivery by a small team or individual, aiming for quick turnaround times.

The article highlights that while methodologies like Scrum are effective in certain environments, startups or teams needing more flexibility might benefit from these alternative approaches which allow for different paces and methods of product development. These methods are gaining traction among modern product teams looking for more adaptive or thorough development processes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a team of three developers who have adopted the Shape Up methodology since January and found it highly beneficial. They appreciate the freedom from traditional project management constraints like Scrum, which allows for creativity, task autonomy, and direct feature delivery without the need for product managers or excessive meetings. The author highlights the liberating aspect of this approach, though notes it might be too unconventional for larger corporate environments.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential market for internal betting and prediction market software within large software companies. The main issue highlighted is psychological; employees find it distressing to lose bets on project outcomes like feature delivery dates, which can negatively impact their perception of their own performance, even if they also have successes.
