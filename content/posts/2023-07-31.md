## 5. [Banished to a remote Idaho valley, beavers created a lush wetland](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36936008)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Beavers relocated to a remote valley in Idaho have created a lush wetland and a natural defense against fire and drought, according to satellite imagery. Beavers in the region were previously trapped and relocated to remote areas to prevent them from causing nuisance by chewing trees and building dams that flood yards and fields. Satellite imagery from NASA shows that beavers in the Baugh Creek area have created dams that have formed ponds and flooded meadows, supporting the growth of grasses and shrubs. These wetlands have also proved resistant to drought and fire. NASA is now using satellite data to introduce more beavers to the landscape and monitor their impact on water flow and plant growth. The aim is to restore beaver populations to their historic levels to increase drought resilience and restore stream areas in Idaho and beyond.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Beaver dams play a crucial role in preventing floods by holding water and releasing it slowly downstream. The accumulation of thousands of such dams results in a longer period for rainwater to dissipate, reducing the risk of rivers bursting their banks and preventing damage to homes and cities. Additionally, the presence of beaver dams helps to maintain wet areas for longer periods, reducing the risk of drought and fires. The solution proposed is to allow beavers to build their dams whenever possible.

## 6. [A Year in Review of 0-days Exploited In-the-Wild in 2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36937047)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 Google's fourth annual year-in-review of 0-day exploits in-the-wild in 2022 revealed some key findings. While there were 41 in-the-wild 0-days detected and disclosed, marking a 40% drop from 2021, the report suggests that the reality is more complicated. Some takeaways include the use of n-days on Android due to long patching times, a shift towards 0-click exploits and new browser mitigations driving down browser 0-days, a high number of bug collisions, and over 40% of the 0-days discovered being variants of previously reported vulnerabilities. The report emphasizes the importance of comprehensive and timely patching, broader mitigations, transparency, and collaboration in addressing these issues.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the existence of gaps between upstream vendors and downstream manufacturers in the technology industry. These gaps allow publicly known vulnerabilities, also known as n-days, to function as 0-days because there is no available patch for the user to protect themselves. In the case of Android, these gaps are more prevalent and last longer. The article suggests that acknowledging this issue may prompt action to improve the ecosystem with downstreams.

## 7. [Ice core scientists in East Greenland reach bedrock](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36944978)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 A team of ice core scientists from the University of Copenhagen has successfully drilled to the bottom of an ice stream, which will provide valuable information about past climate change and help in projecting rising sea levels. The drilling, which took seven years to complete, reached a depth of 2,670 meters. The ice core retrieved contains material that has not seen the light of day for approximately one million years and will be analyzed for insights into how the planet's climate has changed over the past 120,000 years. The research has already provided valuable data, including information about volcanic eruptions and the presence of heavy metals in the atmosphere throughout history. The ice core also revealed that the ice is melting at the bottom. The ice stream, which flows like a river of ice, has a significant impact on the surrounding sea and is important for fishing in Greenland. The researchers expect to begin analyzing the ice core in the fall and anticipate documenting climate changes over the past 11,700 years. The project, called EGRIP, is an international collaboration involving 12 nations and has received support from various foundations and institutions.
