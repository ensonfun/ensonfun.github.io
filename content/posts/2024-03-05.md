 The article discusses the idea of embedding project metadata into Git itself to address certain functionalities that are currently missing in Git. The author suggests that Git is already open-source and peer-to-peer, so there is no need to use additional binaries. They mention that Git lacks features such as code issues, wikis, discussions, GitHub pages, and a developer profile network. The author proposes adding independent references like Git notes to handle these missing functionalities. They provide a link to the Git notes documentation for further reference.

## 2. [Sell for half a billion and get nothing (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39598903)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The article discusses the acquisition of FanDuel by Paddy Power Betfair and its impact on the founders and employees. Despite the high acquisition amount, the founders and most employees did not receive any proceeds due to the strong liquidation preference rights held by the lead investors. Liquidation preference determines who gets paid first and how much they receive in an acquisition. The preference multiple and participation are the two components of liquidation preference. In this case, the lead investors had a liquidation preference that entitled them to the first $559M in the acquisition, leaving the founders with nothing when the deal was only for $465M. The founders were unable to stop the deal due to drag along rights granted to the lead investors. The article emphasizes the importance of building a healthy startup to secure favorable terms and better valuations during fundraising.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of building a healthy and fundable startup. It suggests that a healthy startup attracts more investors during fundraising, allowing founders to negotiate for better terms. These healthy startups also receive better valuations and can raise funds with less effort. However, the reader's takeaway is to bootstrap or self-fund instead of seeking investment.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a venture capitalist's perspective on liquidation preferences. The author suggests that a 1x preference is fair and necessary to protect investors from unscrupulous behavior by founders. Without a liquidation preference, a founder could potentially cash out their shares at a discount immediately after fundraising. The article also acknowledges that liquidation preferences greater than 1x can be the fault of either the founder or the VC, sometimes resulting in an exploitative situation. It gives an example of a founder negotiating a higher valuation in exchange for a higher liquidation preference. The article emphasizes the importance of both sides having good lawyers during fundraising, as they will have a better understanding of terms and benchmarks.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an issue with text generated by a program. Although the program spells words correctly and lays them out properly, the text always appears overly bright and does not blend well with images. This creates a amateurish and unprofessional look, as if the text was simply added on top of the image using Photoshop.

## 5. [European crash tester says carmakers must bring back physical controls](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39598189)

**Total comment counts : 77**

### Summary

 The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) is calling for the automotive industry to change the way controls are implemented in vehicles by 2026. Euro NCAP argues that the overreliance on touchscreens for various functions is a problem as it diverts drivers' attention from the road and increases the risk of distraction-related crashes. The organization proposes using separate physical controls for basic functions, such as turn signals, hazard lights, windshield wipers, the horn, and emergency features like the European Union's eCall. While Euro NCAP cannot mandate carmakers to adopt physical controls, achieving a five-star safety score from the organization is highly valued in the industry and may encourage carmakers to make the change.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Euro NCAP's stance on physical controls in cars. Although they do not require everything to have its own button, they do insist on physical controls for turn signals, hazard lights, windshield wipers, the horn, and any SOS features. The author agrees with this requirement, stating that while touchscreen controls for other functions are acceptable as long as they are responsive, the lack of physical controls for windshield wipers and turn signals in Teslas is seen as a design flaw. Overall, the author supports the need for physical controls for safety-critical functions that are frequently or urgently used.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's frustration with touch controls in cars, which they believe are unsafe while driving. They refuse to buy cars that have replaced physical buttons with touch controls. Additionally, the author criticizes car makers in the US for using flashing red lights as turn signals instead of yellow lights. They argue that red lights are harder to see in sunlight and can be confused with brake lights. The author suggests that all turn signals should be yellow to avoid confusion.
