### Top 2 Comment Summary

 According to the provided information, the board of directors is mostly independent and does not hold equity. The article suggests that the language used in the press release implies the possibility of a personal scandal. The term "not being candid" is interpreted as a form of deceit, or lying. The only significant reason given for such consequences is if Sam, presumably a member of the company, made a decision or progress towards a decision that goes against the company's Charter without the board's knowledge. The speculation is that Sam possibly pursued a commercial agreement, such as a sale, with Microsoft without informing the board, which would have violated the company's open nature.

## 4. ['Energy independent' Uruguay runs on 100% renewables for four straight months](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38301480)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 Uruguay has been able to power its economy solely with renewable energy for nearly four consecutive months. From July to September 2023, the South American nation generated all of its electricity from renewable sources, with wind power being the largest contributor. This trend is expected to continue for an additional month. Uruguay achieved the same milestone in 2022 during the spring months, but had to rely on imported oil over the summer due to a drought that limited hydroelectric output. The country has made significant progress in transitioning to renewable energy due to the need for additional generating capacity. To reduce reliance on volatile imported oil and gas, Uruguay focused on developing solar, wind, water, and biomass waste resources, ruling out nuclear power due to the need for uranium imports. Through clean power auctions and attracting investment of $6 billion in renewable energy, Uruguay has reduced power production costs and created 50,000 new jobs. The rapid increase in wind power capacity has largely displaced oil and gas use, leading to renewables contributing to 97% of the electricity mix between 2017 and 2020. Uruguay's energy independence has shielded it from the impacts of geopolitical events and energy commodity fluctuations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses skepticism towards the headline stating that Uruguay generated all of its electricity from renewable sources in the three months leading up to September 2023. The reasons for skepticism include the reliance on wood for heating, the exclusion of other energy sources like petroleum-powered vehicles, and the failure of a similar initiative in Germany. The author argues that while the article focuses on electricity generation, it does not cover all forms of power and heat exchange. Despite the skepticism, it is seen as a positive development that Uruguay has replaced fossil fuels in its energy infrastructure with low carbon energy production. The author suggests that doubting such progress only portrays one as resistant to change unless it is perfect and immediate.

 According to an individual's personal observation, a significant portion of Montevideo, Uruguay may rely on wood burning for heating. This practice negatively impacts air quality during winter, based on the person's experience of living there for three years.

## 5. [Ethernet Is Still Going Strong After 50 Years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38302283)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The article discusses the invention and development of Ethernet, a networking technology that allows high-speed data transmission over coaxial cables. The development of Ethernet began in 1973 at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in California. The researchers, Robert M. Metcalfe and David Boggs, designed the first version of Ethernet, which transmitted data at up to 2.94 megabits per second. They used coaxial cables and vampire taps to connect computers, printers, and file servers to the network. In 1980, Ethernet was released commercially and quickly became the industry LAN standard. It was adopted as a standard by the IEEE 802 Local Area Network Standards Committee in 1983. Ethernet has since become the standard wired local area network worldwide and is widely used in businesses and homes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of using Ethernet for wired internet connections and setting up access points or jacks for a more stable and consistent connection. However, in situations where running Ethernet is not possible, the author found that using coaxial cables, which were already installed in their current home, can provide data transfer speeds up to 2.5gbps using the MoCA standard. This allows for wired networking connections in various rooms for devices such as computers, televisions, and more.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet, made a prediction in 1995 that the internet would collapse the following year due to its inability to scale. However, this prediction turned out to be incorrect, and he subsequently had to eat his own words. For more information, you can refer to the Wikipedia page about Robert Metcalfe.
