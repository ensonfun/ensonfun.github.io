**Total comment counts : 64**

### Summary

 Google has introduced Gemma, a new generation of open models for developers and researchers to build AI responsibly. These lightweight models are built from the same research and technology used to create Gemini models and are designed to be safe, reliable, and adhere to Google's AI Principles. Gemma models surpass larger models on key benchmarks while maintaining rigorous standards for responsible outputs. Google has also released tools and a Responsible Generative AI Toolkit to support developer innovation and guide responsible use of Gemma models. Developers can access Gemma through platforms like Kaggle and Colab, and researchers can apply for Google Cloud credits. Google plans to expand the Gemma model family and encourages developers to connect, learn, and build with Gemma.

## 2. [Insecure vehicles should be banned, not security tools like the Flipper Zero](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39452494)

**Total comment counts : 68**

### Summary

 The article discusses the federal government's proposed policy to ban security research tools, particularly those used to steal vehicles by copying wireless signals for remote keyless entry. The article argues that this policy is ill-advised, overbroad, and counterproductive. It states that security tools like Flipper Zero, which are essentially programmable radios known as Software Defined Radios (SDRs), have legitimate uses beyond vehicle theft and are necessary for improving product safety. The article suggests that instead of banning these tools, efforts should be focused on enhancing communication channels between cybersecurity experts, car manufacturers, insurers, and the judiciary system to improve the security of automotive keyless entry systems. It also highlights the potential negative impact of the proposed policy on legitimate analysis and repair use-cases, and mentions recent bills that support consumers' rights to repair and interoperability. Overall, the article argues against the proposed ban and advocates for a more constructive approach to addressing the issue of vehicle theft.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the Flipper Zero, a security tool that is considered a programmable radio or Software Defined Radio (SDR). However, the author argues that the Flipper Zero is not as capable as a typical SDR and is actually a fairly weak hacking tool. It can open car doors, but the process is impractical and requires recording the keyfob code out of range of the car and in range of the Flipper. The author also mentions a more advanced attack called rolljam that the Flipper Zero may not be capable of. Although the Flipper Zero is fun, affordable, and popular, the author suggests that real thieves already have better tools for their criminal activities.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that it is unfair and illogical to ban the Flipper Zero, a device that is not even a part of the problem it is accused of contributing to. Similarly, it is also unreasonable to ban insecure vehicles, as consumers have the option to not purchase them or invest in aftermarket security measures. The article also criticizes the use of the term "negligent" when discussing the failure to prevent other people's crimes. The author questions why law-abiding entities like Kia and individuals are labeled as negligent, while criminals are often treated with leniency. The article concludes by stating that it is foolish to discuss the issue of car thefts without focusing on enforcing existing laws and proposing effective solutions, instead of simply making more things illegal.

### Summary

 Japan is investing billions of dollars in an effort to revive its chip-making industry and reduce its dependence on the US-China tech rivalry. The government aims to mass produce state-of-the-art 2 nanometer logic chips by 2027 through a new venture called Rapidus Corp. This move comes as the US and China are competing for access to chipmaking expertise and equipment. Japan plans to attract foreign chipmakers with generous subsidies and has already succeeded in luring Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to invest in production facilities in southern Japan. However, the success of the Rapidus project, which aims to restore Japan's position as a leader in chip technology, is uncertain.

## 5. [Planner programming blows my mind](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39444282)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses Picat, a research language that combines logic programming, imperative programming, and constraint solving. It explains the concept of logic programming, where equations are provided and assignments are found to satisfy those relationships. The article showcases Picat's planner module, which is used to find variable mutations that reach a certain end state. It demonstrates this through an example of solving a pathing problem on a grid. The article also discusses the syntax and features of Picat, including pattern matching and defining actions for the planner.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article explains how they used Picat's planning mode at work to prototype a system for managing maintenance on fleets of devices. Rather than specifying how tasks should be carried out, the system would take high-level instructions and constraints to generate optimal plans. The author found that Picat worked well for smaller problems but struggled to scale to larger ones. They attempted to improve the system by using heuristics, random forests, and symmetry breaking constraints, but still faced challenges. The author concludes that it is still difficult to solve complex planning problems using artificial intelligence.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that HN user hakank has a lot of Picat resources and examples available on his website, which can be found at http://www.hakank.org/picat/.
