## 1. [ISPs should not police online speech no matter how awful it is](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37313349)

**Total comment counts : 98**

### Summary

 The article discusses the risks of entrusting our online expression to private companies that control internet infrastructure. It focuses on the role of Tier 1 ISPs, which can have a significant impact on internet content due to their reach. The article raises concerns about Hurricane Electric, a Tier 1 ISP, allegedly interfering with traffic to a site called Kiwi Farms. Although Kiwi Farms is a forum for hateful speech and planning attacks, the article argues against censorship by infrastructure providers. It highlights the dangers of giving ISPs the power to block content, the lack of alternatives for users, and the potential for censorship to be expanded to other contexts. The article suggests that enforcing existing laws, holding perpetrators accountable, and enacting strong data privacy laws are better approaches to tackling online harassment and abuse. It calls on Tier 1 ISPs to resist becoming chokepoints and emphasizes the importance of content-neutral internet infrastructure.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of private companies acting as "moral police" and potentially censoring free speech on the internet. It mentions examples such as Cloudflare, Visa, Mastercard, and app stores like iOS and Play Stores. The article argues that these companies, along with ISPs blocking traffic for non-illegal sites, are essentially writing the laws about what is allowed online and in society. It highlights the concern that this could be used as a loophole to censor free speech based on personal preferences. While the article acknowledges that the site in question may not be reputable, it suggests that similar actions could be taken against other sites that more people agree with, based on the opinions of individuals or groups within ISPs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the unprofessional behavior of Hurricane Electric (HE) in response to a complaint filed by IncogNet LLC. The complaint alleges that HE prevented access to an entire subnet of IPv6 without sending any abuse reports. Despite this action, the website in question remained online. The author questions HE's decision to block the website, as it does not affect their target market. They argue that HE should remain neutral and prioritize their duties as a transit provider rather than moderating content.

## 2. [Intel shows 8 core 528 thread processor with silicon photonics](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37315802)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 Intel showcased a direct mesh-to-mesh optical fabric at Hot Chips 2023, along with an 8-core processor capable of 66 threads per core. The motivation behind this technology was the DARPA HIVE program's focus on hyper-sparse data workloads. Intel found that these workloads were massively parallel but had poor cache line utilization. The processor is a RISC ISA, not x86, and Intel is using optical networking and on-packaged EMIBs for high-speed connectivity between chips. Silicon photonics engines were added to enable direct connections between chips. The power consumption of the processor is around 75W, with more than half of it being used by silicon photonics. The technology is still in the lab, and it is unclear if it will be commercially available or have a marketing name.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that a processor with 66 threads per core resembles a barrel processor. While these threads may not be very fast, it is expected that if the processor has sufficient tasks, it should stay busy and be productive instead of waiting for memory.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Marvell's development of an SMT8 ARM CPU with "768 Threads Per Node". The CPU is aimed at database workloads and the idea behind it is to have the core work on another thread while waiting for RAM access. The article also mentions that IBM and Zen4C address this demand, but suggests that more SMT16 cloud instances specifically designed for low IPC loads would be beneficial.

## 3. [Fomos: Experimental OS, built with Rust](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37316309)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 The article describes an experimental operating system (OS) built with Rust. The author explores non-Unix OS ideas and aims to create an OS-App ecosystem that requires no implicit configuration. They propose using a context-based approach where apps only need to handle their explicit start context argument, which provides access to OS functions and resources. The author discusses the challenges and possibilities of this approach, including memory management, app cooperation, and data security. The article concludes by acknowledging the influence of Philipp Oppermann's blog and expressing gratitude for advice received.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author argues against the notion that cooperative scheduling is bound to fail. They suggest that apps are already cooperative to some extent and provide an example of how a preemptive system can encounter issues with excessive resource usage. They explain that in a cooperative system, the machine effectively stops if a process does not yield control, which could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities. However, they admit that they may not have a deep understanding of operating systems development and invite corrections from experts.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an app called Fomos, which claims that an app is just a function and nothing else. The author finds this claim to be impressive and wonders if a kernel could be written in this way. They mention that Smalltalk/Squeak may work similarly. The author hopes that the project continues and mentions different features they would like to see, including file systems, task management, safe memory stacks, and resource sharing. They also mention running DOOM as a proof of concept.

### Summary

 Google has introduced a new suite of Environment APIs, including Solar, Air Quality, and Pollen, as part of its efforts to promote sustainability. The Solar API helps solar companies provide homeowners with accurate information for solar installations using artificial intelligence and data from Google Earth imagery. The Air Quality API offers reliable air quality data, heatmap visualizations, and pollutant details to help companies make informed decisions and advocate for change. The Pollen API provides current pollen information, localized pollen count data, and allergen information to support individuals with allergies. These APIs aim to encourage the development of innovative solutions to climate change.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article warns against building large projects on top of Google Maps due to the high costs. The pricing for using Google Maps is described as insane, with even the simplest static map costing $2 per 1,000 requests. Basic map interactivity, such as adding pins using the JavaScript API, increases the cost to 7 times more. For example, creating a map with pins showing current wildfires could cost $14 per every 1,000 requests, resulting in a hefty bill for popular pages. Adding additional functionality, such as geocoding and place details, can further increase the cost, potentially reaching over $5,000 in just one month. The article suggests that the expenses are too high compared to the value provided and advises against using Google Maps for large projects.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is excited about an API that provides pollen information. They suffer from severe seasonal allergies and have tried various treatments. They have had difficulty finding location-specific pollen forecasts and historical data, which they believe is important for timing medication. They plan to build something for themselves using the API to access the data they need.

This technology utilizes algorithms to analyze glucose data and program insulin pumps. The DIY community has been instrumental in pushing the technology forward, with thousands of people now using open-source systems. Commercial systems have also emerged, but many advocates believe that the DIY community continues to innovate and personalize the technology more effectively. The FDA recently granted regulatory clearance to an open-source algorithm for the first time. The article explores the challenges and potential future developments for open-source systems in diabetes care.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential use of shelf-stable glucagon as a hormone that can be injected to raise blood glucose levels, similar to insulin. Currently, Beta Bionics is the only company working on commercializing this technology with dual pumps. The author suggests that having the ability to control both insulin and glucagon levels could be a significant advancement, but it is surprising that there is not much talk about it. The lack of hardware for dual hormone pumps may be a limiting factor in the development of such systems.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights two main drawbacks of insulin-pump systems. Firstly, subcutaneous insulin does not act immediately like it would if injected directly into the blood. It peaks after an hour and gradually decreases after 3-4 hours. Secondly, the pump cannot automatically account for external factors such as carbohydrate intake or exercise plans. These need to be manually entered. The author mentions that not having to worry about counting carbs and predosing insulin would be a dream scenario.

## 8. [Making life (even) harder for proprietary modules](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37319537)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The article discusses the ongoing conflict between the kernel community and creators of proprietary kernel modules. Proprietary modules, which cannot be debugged or fixed by anyone other than their creator, are often seen as a violation of the kernel's license and copyrights. The kernel community has implemented mechanisms such as GPL-only exports to restrict access to kernel functionality by proprietary modules. However, creators of proprietary modules have continuously sought ways to bypass these restrictions. One such method involves using a macro called symbol_get() to obtain addresses from a proprietary module without going through the normal import mechanism. This allows proprietary modules to access kernel functionality despite the restrictions. In response to this workaround, a patch has been proposed to change the behavior of symbol_get() and prevent access to symbols that are not marked GPL-only. The article acknowledges that the conflict between proprietary and open-source modules will likely continue, but efforts to make life uncomfortable for proprietary module creators have often been successful in promoting freely licensed solutions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of this patch commented that symbol_get should be restricted to modules using internal symbols and prevent Nvidia from circumventing access controls lawsuits. This is seen as an attempt to claim protection from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's anti-circumvention law for the open-source Linux kernel. It also implies that EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is a DRM scheme. While the author does not defend Nvidia's behavior, they find it strange that the DRM anti-circumvention law would apply to an open-source project, as it goes against the values of the open-source community.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, may have a legal claim against Nvidia for circumventing copyright protection. The author acknowledges that this is unlikely and would negatively impact the open-source community, but expresses a desire to see it happen due to Nvidia's actions in the past.

They found that deploying Jitsi with the Helm chart was simple and didn't require much memory. The author also mentions that their RAM usage is around 2 GB on idle when running videobridge, web-ui, prosody, and oauth2-proxy atop k3s in its default configuration. However, they highlight the need to open a large range of ports to UDP traffic for videobridge. Overall, the author finds self-hosting Jitsi to be a reliable solution that doesn't require users to create accounts with big tech companies.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the perk of becoming an associate member of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), which grants access to a Jitsi server that the FSF runs. Accessing the server is easy, and the article expresses gratitude for its reliability in conducting webcam classes.

## 10. [Bad Apple Font](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37317055)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 This article discusses the idea of embedding an animation into a font using the experimental wasm shaper in Harfbuzz. The author explains the complexity of standard fonts, giving examples such as ligatures and symbols that have evolved over time. They then describe their process of creating a font with an animation, using SVG files and private use areas in Unicode. The author modifies code and follows a guide to achieve their goal, using the example of a calculator to replace text snippets with frames of the animation. They use Gimp and a patched version of HarfBuzz-git to record and showcase the animated font.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the animation in a text was not playing automatically but was achieved by holding down the "." key. By swapping a series of dots in the font code with glyphs representing different frames of the animation, the illusion of an animated text was created.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article raises concerns about the potential safety risks of incorporating WebAssembly (WASM) into font files. It ponders whether there have been any notable instances of malware hidden in fonts, noting that font layout engines are already capable of running complete Turing programs. The author considers the entire font stack as a potential target for attacks, particularly in light of the fact that Windows used to render fonts in the kernel layer.
