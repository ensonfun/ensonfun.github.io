### Summary

 The author of the article purchased a new laptop and wanted to avoid the hassle of setting it up from scratch. Their colleague suggested copying the entire disk from the old laptop to the new one. The author explains the steps they took to accomplish this, which involved exposing the disk using NVME over TCP, connecting it over the network, and performing a full disk copy using the dd command. They encountered some challenges, such as relying on WiFi for the transfer and adjusting the partition table and file system on the new laptop. However, after resizing the LUKS container and BTRFS file system, they were able to successfully boot into the new laptop with everything working fine. The author concludes that this process saved them time and allowed them to quickly adjust to their new laptop.

## 3. [Simpson's paradox](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39673754)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Simpson's paradox is a phenomenon in statistics where a trend appears in separate groups of data, but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. The paradox is commonly observed in social and medical sciences and can lead to misleading results if causal interpretations are given to frequency data. The paradox can be resolved by appropriately addressing confounding variables and causal relations in statistical modeling. The phenomenon was first described by Edward H. Simpson in 1951, but similar effects were mentioned earlier by statisticians Karl Pearson and Udny Yule. The paradox is also known as Simpson's reversal, the Yule-Simpson effect, the amalgamation paradox, or the reversal paradox. One well-known example of Simpson's paradox is a study of gender bias in graduate school admissions at UC Berkeley. The admission figures initially showed a bias in favor of men, but when considering department information, it was revealed that women tended to apply to more competitive departments with lower rates of admission, while men applied to less competitive departments with higher rates of admission. When the data were pooled and corrected, a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women was found. Another example involves a medical study comparing the success rates of two treatments for kidney stones. The paradox arises because the size of the stones is a confounding variable that affects the results. Treatment A appears more effective for both small and large stones when considered separately, but treatment B appears more effective when considering both sizes together due to its higher frequency of use in small stone cases, which are easier to treat. Simpson's paradox can also be observed in professional baseball batting averages, where one player may have a higher batting average than another player each year, but a lower batting average when considering all the years. This can occur when there are large differences in the number of at-bats between the years.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recounts a personal experience where their marketing team claimed that their marketing cost of goods sold had been declining across every product category. However, at the end of the year, it was discovered that the cost of goods sold had actually doubled. Upon investigation, it was found that while the marketing spend on each individual product category had decreased, the overall mix of product categories had changed significantly, with one category experiencing substantial growth. This resulted in the aggregate marketing costs percentage increasing, despite improvements in every category. The author had to explain the Yule Simpson paradox to the accountants to clarify the situation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of Simpson's paradox and quotes mathematician Jordan Ellenberg who argues that it is misnamed. Ellenberg suggests that Simpson's paradox is not a contradiction but rather two different ways of interpreting the same data. He emphasizes the importance of considering both the parts and the whole simultaneously. The article highlights the significance of this approach in the context of various scientific discoveries made by Epicureans centuries ago. It concludes by emphasizing the relevance of this analytical method in data analysis.

## 4. [Breaking down tasks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39675249)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 This article discusses the process of breaking down tasks in software projects. The author starts by explaining that the previous articles in the series assume a clearly defined task list, but in this case, the manager needs help with the initial step of breaking down a project. The author then uses an example of building a personal streak tracker to illustrate the process. They start by creating a visual mockup and then break down the task into constituent pieces. The author acknowledges that there may still be uncertainty and further breaks down the tasks to add more detail. They conclude by summarizing the interactive process of breaking down tasks and defining key terms.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author acknowledges that they, like everyone else, often fail to follow through with their planned steps and encounter boredom in their work.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that distance measures are dependent on the metric they implement and that if we believe in the manifold hypothesis, these metrics should be local. It points out that using an ordinary dot product to compare straight lines on a map of the globe is a mistake because the lines are not actually straight and do not account for the curvature of the manifold. The article compares this error to the fallacy of believing in a flat Earth.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article argues that taking cosine similarity between two features in a learned embedding can lead to arbitrary and non-unique results. The author questions whether uniqueness was ever guaranteed, considering that cosine similarity is a distance metric. They suggest that it is reasonable to assume that two features can be equidistant to the ideal solution of a linear system of equations. The author is unsure if they are missing something.

## 10. [See 'horned' comet 12P/Pons-Brooks in the night sky](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39674107)

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks is set to arrive at perihelion on April 21 and has been exhibiting sudden flare-ups in brightness. To catch sight of this comet, you will need binoculars or a telescope and a sky map. It is named after two renowned comet hunters, Jean-Louis Pons and William R. Brooks. Pons discovered it in 1812, describing it as a shapeless object that later became visible to the naked eye. Brooks rediscovered the comet in 1883 and it was realized that it was the same comet discovered by Pons. Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks has an orbital period of approximately 71 years and is considered a "Halley-type" comet. It displayed favorable apparitions in 1883-1884 and has a history of sudden flare-ups in brightness. There is evidence that ancient records of bright comets may have been referring to 12P/Pons-Brooks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses disappointment that a certain phenomenon will not be visible during the eclipse, contrary to what was previously thought.
