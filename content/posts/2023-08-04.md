### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article suggests that they do not see any evidence of superconductivity in the video. They explain that if the material being shown is a type-II superconductor, there should be evidence of flux pinning, where the material would be stuck in place when moved with a tweezer due to magnetic flux lines being pinned to defects. The author also mentions that the critical field of a small flake of the material is relatively low, and suggests using an electromagnet to increase the field strength and observe if the material drops once the critical field is reached. They propose that a more convincing test would be to observe the breakdown of diamagnetism with an increase in field strength without hysteresis. The author suggests that another test could be to produce a Josephson junction and measure Shapiro steps at high frequency, which is a characteristic of superconducting quantum materials. They also mention the possibility of using microwave irradiation and measuring reflectivity/transmittance to detect an intrinsic Josephson effect. However, the author concludes by stating that without more details about the material, it is difficult to determine if it is indeed a superconducting material.

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The "pipe" value that appears in the rtt statistics when using the ping command indicates the maximum number of echo request packets that were sent without receiving an echo reply. It increases each time a new echo request is sent before the previous ones are answered. The pipe value can be observed by pinging a system with a longer round trip time (rtt) and decreasing the interval time between requests. Systems on slow or distant links, such as those in New Zealand, can be used for testing.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The "pipe" number refers to the maximum number of echo request packets that were sent but not answered by an echo reply packet, before eventually receiving a response.
