### Summary

 The article discusses Microsoft's recent blog post about Windows system components beginning to respect the default web browser setting. However, the author claims that after extensive testing, they have not found any changes in the new Windows Insider version. The confusion seems to stem from a highlighted but vague entry in the changelog for a recent Windows 11 Insider preview build. The author, who developed the EdgeDeflector program, tests the changes but finds that web links still force-open in Microsoft Edge instead of the default browser. Despite positive press attention, the author questions whether the change actually worked, as they have not found any confirmation or checks from users or news sites. The author also mentions that Microsoft has not made any statements to media outlets regarding the vague changes. It should be noted that the author is an employee of Vivaldi Technologies, a competitor to Microsoft Edge.

## 4. [HDMI ISA graphics card for vintage PCs by improving the Graphics Gremlin](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462947)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Graphics Gremlin (GG), an open-source project that allows vintage PCs to connect to modern HDMI monitors without additional adapters. The GG uses scan doubling for Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) and increases the vertical refresh rate for Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) to output to a VGA port. However, the GG has limitations, such as the inability to use the VGA and Composite video ports simultaneously and the need for a VGA-to-HDMI adapter, which can result in a loss of video quality. The author modified the GG design to connect natively to an HDMI monitor while still servicing the internal composite-based CRT. The modifications include incorporating a dedicated DVI transmitter and integrating RGBI signals with the TFP410 chip. The author also added test points and made code modifications. Various tests were conducted using tools like a logic analyzer and an FPGA test project. The author encountered challenges with signal compatibility and emulating certain colors. Ultimately, the modified GG card was tested and installed in an IBM5155, successfully outputting HDMI to a monitor and composite to an LCD display. The author acknowledges the original GG designer, Eric Schlaepfer, and provides a link to the open-sourced PCB design and Verilog code.

 The article discusses the HDMI protocol and its similarities to VGA. HDMI is a digital protocol that replaces the analog signals of VGA with digital signals. It uses an HDMI encoder chip instead of a RAMDAC. To set the HDMI encoder chip in the right mode, control of an i2c interface is typically required.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The retrocomputing community has faced challenges in creating display controllers, as it is not practical to use 74xx/54xx parts due to their limited capabilities. Instead, projects such as the Commander X16 utilize FPGA or microcontrollers as display controllers since they do not have the volume to justify creating an ASIC. Notably, older systems like the ZX80 used a trick to make the microprocessor function as a video controller, allowing video display only when the processor was not busy. This technique can still be employed today to use a secondary microprocessor as a display controller.

## 6. [UK air traffic control meltdown](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461695)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 The UK's air traffic control operator, NATS, experienced a major technical incident on August 28, 2023, resulting in the cancellation of over 2,000 flights and an estimated cost of over £100 million GBP. The incident was caused by a faulty flight plan entered into the system, which prevented the extraction of the UK portion of the flight plan. The software used to process the flight plans was unable to handle duplicate waypoint names located outside of the UK, resulting in a critical exception being raised and the system shutting down. The backup system also failed to process the flight plan correctly. The issue was eventually resolved with assistance from the system manufacturer, Frequentis AG. The incident highlighted the need for improved procedures for handling errors and better system resilience. NATS is considering working with ICAO to address duplicate waypoint names in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article mentions a bug related to a flight navigation system. They emphasize the importance of including a geofence to prevent this bug from occurring.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a problem at NATS where the primary system failed, causing them to switch to a secondary system that also failed for the same reason. The author suggests that failover should only occur if it is known that the problem is with the primary system and not with the software itself. The author also criticizes the lack of a method called "ValidateFlightPlan" that would handle errors when parsing input, and mentions their own experience with handling bad input in a simple way.

## 8. [How could the early Unix OS comprise so few lines of code?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37462806)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 The article discusses the size and complexity of the original UNIX operating system. The author questions the claim that UNIX was written in only 13,000 lines of code and wonders how they managed to keep it so small. The article explains that while modern operating systems have millions of lines of code, most of it is dedicated to supporting various hardware devices and features. The core of the original UNIX system consisted of basic memory management, process implementation, and a file system, which could be implemented in relatively few lines of code. The article also mentions that the increasing complexity of computer systems over time has led to larger operating systems. The author provides references to books and resources for further reading on the topic.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the difference in code size between a basic regular expression matcher and a more complex one. The author uses an example of a 35-line code in C by Rob Pike versus the ~20597 lines of code in the Ruby 3.2.2 regular expression engine. While the Ruby engine is much larger and supports a more complex syntax, the initial 35 lines of code provide a significant boost in functionality. The article emphasizes the importance of starting small and gradually adding features as needed, especially for small systems and teams. The author suggests that many developers today are not accustomed to considering the constraints of small systems and tend to design for numerous features from the start.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article believes that most programs that are currently 100,000 lines of code could be rewritten to just 10,000 lines, making them more reliable. They argue that feature creep is responsible for the excess code and that developers who prioritize speed over conciseness end up with more lines of code. Lack of time and rushed coding also lead to workarounds and sub-optimal abstractions, resulting in even more bad code. The author suggests that having foresight and taking the time to plan and brainstorm before coding can help reduce the number of lines required. Visual aids and playing devil's advocate with ideas are also recommended. In conclusion, the author emphasizes the importance of time and planning in developing efficient and concise code.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests a simple solution for improving dishwasher performance. By replacing dishwasher pods with powder detergent and adding detergent to the prewash cup or the dishwasher door, the dishwasher gets detergent for two cycles instead of one, making a significant difference in cleaning difficult dishes. The article highlights that pods are similar to powder detergent but are more expensive and do not allow for adjusting the amount of detergent based on water hardness, potentially causing a film on clean dishes. It also provides a video link for more information and suggests testing the method by adding an extra pod initially before switching to powder detergent to save costs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a recent rule change regarding energy efficiency standards for residential dishwashers. Currently, dishwashers are required to use no more than 307 kWh per year and 5.0 gallons of water per cycle for the "Normal" cycle. However, manufacturers are finding it challenging to meet these standards without having very long cycle times. The Department of Energy (DOE) has recognized this issue and is considering allowing more water and energy usage for faster dishwashers. The author also mentions their personal preference for a freshwater rinse at the end of the dishwasher cycle and questions the use of kWh per year as a measurement standard.
