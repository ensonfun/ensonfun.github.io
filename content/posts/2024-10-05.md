## 3. [Mitmproxy 11: Full HTTP/3 Support](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41744434)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article announces the release of mitmproxy 11, which includes full support for HTTP/3 in both transparent and reverse proxy modes, alongside significant DNS improvements. Gaurav Jain, a Google Summer of Code student, highlights his contributions to enhancing low-level networking features, particularly for HTTP/3 and DNS.

Key updates include:

1. **HTTP/3 Support**: mitmproxy now works seamlessly with HTTP/3, allowing it to handle both TCP and UDP packets across various clients like Firefox and Chrome. A known limitation affects Chrome's trust in user-added Certificate Authorities for QUIC, necessitating a trusted certificate or specific command line adjustments.

2. **DNS Enhancements**: The DNS functionality has been revamped using the Rust-based Hickory DNS library, enabling the resolution of various query types beyond A/AAAA records, such as HTTPS records for HTTP/3 support. Mitmproxy now also supports DNS-over-TCP, enhancing flexibility in managing larger queries.

3. **Privacy Features**: Support for Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) improves privacy by encrypting the initial handshake, although it complicated mitmproxy's certificate generation process. Mitmproxy now strips ECH keys from HTTPS records to maintain functionality.

The work was part of the Google Summer of Code, with mentorship from Maximilian Hils. Mitmproxy is maintained by a core team with contributions from the community.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses appreciation for the ongoing development of Mitmproxy, which played a significant role in their career. In 2011, they used Mitmproxy to learn about API development by intercepting requests from a mobile app. This led them to discover a vulnerability in Airbnb's API related to Rails mass assignment. After modifying some harmless attributes and contacting the company, the author secured an interview, ultimately shaping their professional journey.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a decision by the Chrome team not to trust user-added Certificate Authorities (CAs) for the QUIC protocol. They explain that this restriction aims to prevent the potential deployment of QUIC interception software or hardware, which could adversely affect the protocol's future development. Users who need to use non-publicly-trusted certificates are advised to utilize TLS over TCP instead. The author expresses confusion about how banning custom certificates relates to the long-term adaptability of QUIC and seeks clarification on the reasons behind this policy.

## 4. [It's Time to Stop Taking Sam Altman at His Word](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41749371)

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article critiques OpenAI's recent actions, suggesting that CEO Sam Altman is preparing for a quick exit rather than focusing on long-term goals like AGI or the next generation model, GPT-5. Key points include the hype around GPT-5 being overstated, the dissolution of the safety team, and a shift to for-profit status while promoting AGI. The author believes these decisions indicate a lack of commitment to future advancements and an awareness of an impending decline in hype. While acknowledging AI's significant impact, the author predicts that Altman will exit before the technology reaches its full potential.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the unrealistic hype surrounding technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) by comparing them to a hypothetical 3D printer that can produce any car part for free. While this technology could revolutionize the car industry by eliminating the need for manufacturers and distributors, it would not erase the necessity for skilled mechanics and engineers to correctly utilize these parts. The author argues that simply being able to generate components (like code or images) does not equate to being able to apply them effectively. This limitation parallels the ongoing challenges in the practical application of LLMs, suggesting it might serve as an inherent solution to alignment problems in these technologies.

## 5. [How were 70s versions of games like Pong built without a programmable computer?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41745032)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article discusses the nature of 1970s video game implementation, particularly focusing on how games like Pong were created without programmable computers. It explains that early game systems, such as Pong, relied heavily on specialized hardware like timers and simple logic circuits to manage game mechanics. Timers determined the positions of the ball and paddles, while collision detection was facilitated through basic AND gate operations. The author reflects on their own understanding as a Computer Science graduate and shares a valuable online resource for visualizing Pongâ€™s mechanics. They also draw parallels to other industries, noting that traditional methods (e.g., relays) were still in use years later, despite advancements in technology. The discussion emphasizes the ingenuity behind hardware implementations of games and control systems, highlighting the difference between hardware-focused and software-based approaches.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In an episode of "That '70s Show," characters Kelso and Red attempt to modify the game Pong by making the paddles smaller, which leads to a misunderstanding about modding software with a soldering iron. The author recalls debating this with a friend, only to be corrected by the friend's dad, who explained that Pong lacks software. Ultimately, the author discovers that the modification was actually feasible, requiring only a simple soldering adjustment to accommodate different TV sizes, rather than being a complex task.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author, a Computer Science graduate without an Electrical Engineering background, reflects on the necessity for CS curricula to emphasize digital logic before delving into complex computer architectures. They reference a series of articles that reverse-engineer the AY-3-8500, one of the first Pong integrated circuits, as a resource for understanding these fundamentals.
