## 2. [Escaping the Chrome Sandbox Through DevTools](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41866802)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 In the blog post by ading2210, the author discusses the discovery of two significant vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-6778 and CVE-2024-5836) in the Chromium web browser that permitted a sandbox escape from a browser extension with minimal user interaction. These vulnerabilities allowed malicious extensions to execute any shell command on a user's PC, potentially leading to severe malware installation and full system compromise—not just unauthorized access to browser data.

Chromium employs a sandboxing mechanism that isolates untrusted code, which typically limits it to interacting only with its own environment and specific granted APIs. Privileged WebUI pages, such as chrome://settings and chrome://history, utilize private APIs to interact with the browser's native code, and untrusted JavaScript on these pages poses a major security risk as it can bypass sandbox restrictions.

The author, while investigating Chromium's enterprise policy system, uncovered an edge case that developers hadn’t accounted for. This system allows administrators to enforce policies on Chrome devices, which can be set locally across platforms and requires root permissions for modifications. An undocumented feature in the WebUI for viewing policies seemed to offer a path to manipulate these settings, leading to the discovery of the vulnerabilities. Google later rewarded the author with $20,000 for the report.

## 3. [Why birds do not fall while sleeping](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41846471)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 Scientists from the National Museum of Natural History (MNHN) and CNRS have published research explaining how birds can sleep while standing, attributing this ability to a property called tensegrity, which refers to stability achieved through the interplay of tension and compression in a structure. While horses and cattle can stand without losing balance due to their four legs, the mechanism in birds, which share a common structural blueprint, is different due to their bipedal nature.

The study focused on bird feet, noting that birds maintain a 'crouched' position that allows them to rest and conserve energy. To understand this, researchers created a digital model based on the anatomy of a small bird, the mandarin diamondbird. Initially, their model was unstable; however, they improved its stability by adding multiple cables to replicate the birds' natural balance.

These findings shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that enable birds to maintain posture, sleep, and thrive in various environments, emphasizing their unique anatomical features compared to other living beings.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article raises a question about why certain animals, like horses, cows, giraffes, and birds, have evolved to use passive mechanisms for maintaining their position instead of developing a more active brain function dedicated to this task. It suggests that this approach may limit the benefits of sleep for these animals, proposing a deeper inquiry into the evolutionary choices that led to their current adaptations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses why standing birds do not fall asleep while perched. It also touches on a related topic: how some flying birds, like frigatebirds, can sleep while in the air. These birds practice hemispherical sleeping, allowing only one half of their brain to rest, and typically do so while ascending in thermal updrafts, which is considered the safest part of their flight.

Additionally, the article references a notable video where a paraglider collides with an eagle mid-flight. It suggests that the eagle might have been dozing while flying. However, verifying this is challenging. Both the pilot and the eagle appeared to be unharmed after the incident.

## 4. [Using Cloudflare on your website could be blocking RSS users](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41864632)

### Summary

 The article discusses the issues RSS feed readers face when accessing websites protected by Cloudflare's security features. Many users rely on RSS readers to stay updated with content, but Cloudflare's Bot Fight Mode and other similar settings often inadvertently block these legitimate readers. When an RSS reader attempts to access a site, Cloudflare may present it with challenges meant for bots or outright block it, making it impossible for the reader to retrieve website content.

To resolve this, website owners can create custom rules to whitelist RSS readers, either by their user agent or IP address. However, this process is cumbersome, especially since user agents can be disguised. Cloudflare has a bot verification program that allows RSS readers to apply for exemption from blocking, but the application process is criticized for being ineffective and poorly managed, as verified readers may still face blocks.
