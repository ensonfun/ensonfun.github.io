### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article titled "I made epitaphs! AMA" discusses the author's creation of epitaphs and invites readers to ask them anything (AMA stands for "Ask Me Anything"). Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the content.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests using Git for running a process where changes need to be tracked. The recommended approach is to use Git along with a cron job to automatically commit and record changes made to a source of information. The article provides an example command that utilizes curl to fetch data and then commits it to a Git repository. By using this method, a commit history is created, allowing users to track changes over time by using the "git log" command. The article also mentions that this approach is frequently used in scheduled GitHub Actions. For more details, refer to the provided link.

## 3. [What's new in the Postgres 16 query planner](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39310837)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses improvements made to the query planner in PostgreSQL 16. It specifically focuses on 10 improvements and provides comparisons between PostgreSQL 15 and PostgreSQL 16. Some of the improvements include incremental sorts for SELECT DISTINCT queries, the planner forming a plan with pre-sorted input for aggregate functions, and the use of Memoize for parameterized Nested Loop queries. The article highlights the performance benefits of these improvements and provides examples from the EXPLAIN output.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses a desire for the PostgreSQL query planner to have the ability to replan a query during execution. They explain that slow queries often occur because the query planner lacks knowledge about the data distribution and cannot accurately estimate the cost of planning the query. This can result in a significant impact on execution time. The author suggests a solution where the query starts execution and if progress is slower than expected, the current progress information is fed back to the planner for replanning. If the updated plan shows that discarding current results and starting with a new approach would be quicker, this should be done. However, the author acknowledges that implementing this feature would require significant infrastructure changes in PostgreSQL due to its streaming queries and the ability for clients to reverse the direction of a query.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their frustration with the Just-In-Time (JIT) feature in newer versions of Postgres. They found that the JIT, which is meant to improve query execution, actually made the queries slower in some cases. They mention a specific scenario where a straightforward query with multiple joins took significantly longer to execute with JIT enabled compared to without it. The author suggests disabling the JIT as a workaround, but highlights that this default setting can give a negative impression to users who are not familiar with its impact on performance.

## 4. [Permutation City (1994)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39313696)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 The article discusses a character named Paul who creates software simulations of his brain and body in virtual reality. These simulations run slower than real time and are meant to be used for experiments on artificial intelligence, time, and causality. However, the simulations keep shutting down and refusing to participate in the experiments. Another character, Maria, is addicted to a virtual world called the Autoverse and is offered a job by Paul to design a seed for a virtual biosphere within the Autoverse. The catch is that a simulation of the Autoverse large enough to support the biosphere is beyond the capabilities of current computers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

It also discusses the security implications and features of different configuration options. The team behind Sudo for Windows is planning to expand documentation and gather feedback from users.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article announces that Sudo, a command commonly used in Linux to run commands as an administrator, is coming to Windows. It explains that it is not simply a straight port from Linux, as there are differences in the permissions structure between the two operating systems. However, the goal of being able to run admin commands in the same terminal window is being achieved. The author has been working on this development for the past few months and is excited to discuss it further.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the reason for Funimation's existence over the past year was because they did not want to negotiate moving licenses to Crunchyroll. As a result, the remaining content that is owned by Funimation and not Crunchyroll will most likely have its licenses expire instead of being transferred. Additionally, there is concern that purchased digital copies from Funimation will not be migrated over to Crunchyroll, causing some users to lose access to content they have paid for. Crunchyroll currently does not support Funimation Digital copies, but they are continuously working to improve their anime streaming offerings.

However, they found it cool to have a year's worth of imagery at 10-minute intervals.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with software-defined radio (SDR) and their attempt to write an SDR tuner in JavaScript. They encountered a bug that caused the tuner to fail when attempting to tune to a different frequency. The author considers revisiting the project to see if the issue can now be resolved. Additionally, they provide links to websites where near-realtime weather images can be accessed without the need for SDR. The author also mentions a service they built that provides 3-hourly cloud maps for the entire Earth, which can be found on GitHub.

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses the historical significance of spices and drugs, focusing on the trade routes of the Indian Ocean and the value placed on exotic substances. It mentions the Goa stone, a valuable container for the lapis de Goa, which was believed to offer protection against poisoning. The author argues that spices and drugs were considered medicinal simples in medieval and early modern periods, blurring the distinction between culinary and medical uses. The article also explores the question of why humans risked their lives to transport these substances and cites anthropologist Ruth Benedict's perspective on visionary states and drug-induced experiences.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the puzzle of the spice trade, particularly focusing on the cost of transporting spices during the medieval and early modern periods. The author questions the expense of sea transport at that time and also considers the military overhead costs involved. The time period mentioned in the article seems to encompass both the medieval and early modern periods, creating a wide span of history.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that substances like nutmeg, sugar, and tea have slight mood-altering effects. The author is intrigued by the mention of tea, stating that while tea is only slightly mood-altering, the fact that it was made with boiled water may have had a greater impact by reducing the risk of waterborne diseases. The author also mentions that although other beverages like beer and mead also required boiling, their alcohol content is a depressant. The author believes that the combination of boiled water and a small amount of caffeine in tea would have been significant for a population not accustomed to it.
