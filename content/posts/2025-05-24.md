Despite not being bitter about it, they express a desire for recognition of their own achievements. They realize that their aversion to sharing personal successes might be preventing meaningful connections, as they haven't allowed others to celebrate with them. This insight prompts a reconsideration of their approach to relationships and sharing wins. Overall, the author appreciates the perspective offered in the post that sparked this realization.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 A recent conversation revealed that some people derive pleasure from witnessing their friends' failures, a phenomenon linked to common behaviors in friendships. Research shows this sadistic tendency may stem from a desire for excitement, particularly during periods of boredom. The author was surprised by these findings, which suggest that while many enjoy seeing acquaintances succeed, friends often take pleasure in each other's setbacks. This connection between boredom and sadism indicates a complex relationship in social dynamics.

## 2. [Why Algebraic Effects?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44078434)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 Algebraic effects, or effect handlers, are an emerging programming feature with significant potential for future languages. They simplify the implementation of various constructs like generators, exceptions, and coroutines, by allowing functions to be polymorphic over effects. This means functions can easily handle different types of effects (like logging or database access) without complicated code. Their composability enhances usability, and beyond advanced features, they are also beneficial in standard applications for tasks like dependency injection and cleaner API design. Overall, algebraic effects offer greater expressivity and flexibility in programming.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two main downsides of a code snippet involving function calls that may fail. First, there's no explicit indication that the functions `foo` and `bar` can throw errors, requiring a type signature lookup for clarification. Second, determining the error handling code is complicated, as it necessitates traversing the call stack to find the relevant 'with' expression, which cannot be done statically due to potential multiple callers with different handlers. While the concept is intriguing, the author expresses significant concerns regarding code readability and debuggability.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author questions the assertion that Algebraic Effects (AE) generalize control flow for implementing coroutines. They suggest that a straightforward implementation of AE in a language runtime would use coroutines, treating effects as syntactic variations of yield/resume. They are seeking clarification on what they might be overlooking in this argument.

## 3. [Mermaid: Generation of diagrams like flowcharts or sequence diagrams from text](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44049619)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Mermaid is a JavaScript-based tool that allows users to create and modify complex diagrams using Markdown-like text definitions. It addresses the problem of outdated documentation in development by enabling easy, modifiable diagrams for both programmers and non-programmers. Mermaid can be integrated with popular applications and features a Live Editor for creation and previews. The tool prioritizes security by rendering diagrams in a sandboxed iframe to prevent embedded scripts from executing. Mermaid has a supportive community, welcomes new contributors, and offers resources like tutorials and a contribution guide.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article praises Mermaid for two key reasons: 

1. An almost WYSIWYG editor at [mermaidchart.com](https://www.mermaidchart.com/play) that conveniently updates the layout while drawing.
2. Notion's support for inline Mermaid charts within code blocks, complete with previews, making it great for adding architecture diagrams to engineering documentation.

## 10. [The Xenon Death Flash: How a Camera Nearly Killed the Raspberry Pi 2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44080533)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 In 2015, Peter Onion discovered that a Raspberry Pi 2 would shut down when exposed to xenon camera flashes, a bizarre hardware vulnerability. The community investigated, finding that the issue stemmed from the U16 chip's Wafer-Level Chip Scale Packaging, which made it sensitive to high-intensity light. Tests revealed that only xenon flashes caused the problem, disrupting voltage regulation via the photoelectric effect. The immediate fix involved covering the chip with opaque materials, while a later hardware revision eliminated the vulnerability altogether. This incident highlighted increasing optical interference risks as semiconductor technology advances.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes that photosensitivity in WLCSP (Wafer-Level Chip Scale Package) parts is well-known and documented in their data sheets, not a recent discovery. Engineers are responsible for recognizing this trait, as these chips, being bare silicon, are inherently light-sensitive. It criticizes those who neglect this aspect in their designs, implying a lack of basic engineering knowledge and responsibility. The author suggests that understanding semiconductor characteristics and consulting data sheets are essential practices for engineers to prevent design errors. Overall, it reflects frustration towards oversights in engineering protocol.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The commenter finds the author’s writing style irritating due to unnecessary information that fails to clarify points and sensationalizes content. They mention specific examples, such as references to Einstein and phrases like "Blu-Tack (yes, really)." The commenter suggests that the author, who uses language models for assistance, should rely on them less and critically evaluate their output. Overall, the reading experience was frustrating, alternating between interest and annoyance.
