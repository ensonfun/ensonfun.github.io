## 1. [Synology Lost the Plot with Hard Drive Locking Move](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43734706)

**Total comment counts : 62**

### Summary

 Synology is reportedly locking its upcoming 2025 Plus NAS models to its own branded hard drives, limiting users' options and features essential for data management. This move is criticized as self-serving and detrimental to customers, who will face restrictions on storage pools and drive compatibility, raising concerns about hardware support and potential vendor lock-in. Compared to competitors like QNAP and TrueNAS that offer greater flexibility and better hardware, Synology's decision may hinder user experience and data security, especially regarding long-term drive availability and performance.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the strengths of Synology NAS, particularly its app ecosystem that enhances functionality beyond file storage, such as automated backups and media streaming. The author appreciates Synology's premium drives for professional use but criticizes the company's enforcement of restrictions on third-party drives across all models, arguing it alienates home users. They suggest Synology should provide a list of incompatible drives and allow customers to utilize their systems fully, rather than penalizing them for using non-Synology drives.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Synology's decision to sell only compatible hard drives stems from previous incidents where manufacturers misled customers about drive suitability, like Western Digital's unduly selling SMR drives as NAS-compatible. This caused significant issues for users, leading to problems with data restoration and product failures. To address these misleading practices, Synology guarantees that its drives are explicitly suitable for NAS use, ensuring customers receive reliable products without hidden incompatibilities.

## 2. [Attacking My Landlord's Boiler](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43759073)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience trying to improve the heating system in their apartment without altering the existing setup, as modifications would require landlord permission. To address issues with their landlord's radio-controlled thermostat, the author explores a “Replay Attack” method to clone and resend signals between the thermostat and the boiler. They highlight the challenges faced due to a lack of resources on the 868MHz frequency in the U.S. and suggest using a Software-Defined Radio to inspect the signals, while emphasizing legal considerations for transmitting radio signals.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author describes an efficient heating system that turns off while in town and resumes shortly before returning home. To save energy and money, it's suggested to lower the water circulation temperatures of a condensing boiler and use outdoor reset technology, which adjusts flow temperatures based on the weather. With proper tuning, the system can maintain comfortable temperatures without overheating, achieving an 8-15% reduction in gas usage. However, this setup limits the use of deep setback settings, which could save more money but require longer recovery times.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests a simple approach to controlling a thermostat by directly manipulating its temperature using a small box equipped with a Peltier element. Instead of altering radio signals, they propose cooling the inside of the box to activate heating and warming it to stop heating. The author acknowledges that their experience in building thermal control devices may make this method seem easier.

## 4. [Verus: Verified Rust for low-level systems code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43745987)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 Verus is a tool for verifying the correctness of Rust code by allowing developers to specify expected behaviors and statically checking that code meets these specifications. It uses powerful solvers to prove correctness without runtime checks. Currently supporting a subset of Rust, Verus facilitates checks beyond the standard type system. While under active development, users are encouraged to engage with the community for support and contribute to documentation and projects. Resources include a browser-based playground, installation guides, and discussion platforms on Zulip and GitHub. Contributions are welcomed and appreciated.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author argues for a common specification language to reduce overlap among various tools like Prusti and Creusot. They emphasize that while each tool has unique features, a unified syntax for basic expectations, such as indicating that a function should not panic, would enhance usability across different tools.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article questions whether integrating dependent types into a programming language would enhance the ability to guarantee specifications or if existing tools might offer distinct advantages over dependent typing. It explores the pros and cons of including dependent types in language design compared to utilizing standalone tools, weighing the potential for stronger guarantees against the flexibility that existing tools may provide.

It asks if this comparison provides a meaningful metric or if it's merely a statistic that is easier to communicate in media.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The discussion revolves around the practical applications of quantum computing. While quantum state experiments are ongoing, the article suggests that we are not yet at the stage of using quantum computers for general or significant disruptor applications, like factorization. The piece questions who might benefit from quantum technology at this stage, highlighting a gap between theoretical advancements and real-world usage.

## 8. [101 BASIC Computer Games](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43757341)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The article discusses a collection of type-in programs from the March 1975 edition of David Ahl's "101 BASIC Computer Games," highlighting that it differs from the later "BASIC Computer Games" published by Ahl through Creative Computing. The collection showcases various original DEC and Dartmouth dialects of BASIC, with programs exhibiting distinct syntax and styles. It emphasizes that some games are unique to this collection, and many can run on RetroBASIC without modification. The compilation utilized OCR technology for accuracy and aims to enhance programming examples available for RetroBASIC users.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses excitement about rediscovering the game Hammurabi, which holds significance in their past. They recall their first experience with programming in 1991, when their father bought an Osborne 486 PC. At a school fete, they purchased a book, learned Q-Basic, and encountered their first bug when mistakenly writing "LET P=P+1" instead of "LET P=P+I." This moment marked the beginning of their journey into programming and debugging.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 For a genuine BASIC experience, consider using a DOS emulator like DosBos-X to install QuickBasic 4.5, which features a compiler and additional benefits over Microsoft QBASIC. While modern alternatives like QB64 exist, they lose some of BASIC's charm by moving to a compiled format. An example project that runs well on DosBox can be found at Specular Realms.

## 9. [Abusing DuckDB-WASM by making SQL draw 3D graphics (Sort Of)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43761998)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The author experimented with building a 3D game engine using SQL queries to manage game state, leveraging DuckDB-WASM for a text-based Doom clone. Instead of traditional game loops, the database holds all game data, and rendering is driven by a SQL VIEW that uses recursive CTEs for raycasting and character generation. Despite numerous challenges, particularly with asynchronous operations and SQL quirks, the project demonstrated the potential for analytical databases in gaming applications, ultimately blending SQL's capabilities and JavaScript orchestration into a functional albeit unconventional game framework.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses excitement about their project featured on Hacker News. They invite readers to play the game "DuckDB Doom" at the provided link and mention that pressing "L" activates detailed logging in the development console, displaying the SQL commands executed.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses excitement that someone has successfully written a game in SQL, a task they struggled with due to buggy query-optimizers. Specifically, previous issues stemmed from the incorrect caching of `rand()` calls, despite assurances in the documentation that this would not occur.
