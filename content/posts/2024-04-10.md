## 1. [Yes, social media is a cause of the epidemic of teenage mental illness](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39983233)

**Total comment counts : 83**

### Summary

 The article discusses the ongoing debate between skeptics and alarmists regarding the effects of social media on teenage mental health. The author, who falls into the alarmist camp, argues that there is evidence of causation between social media use and mental illness, contrary to what the skeptics claim. The skeptics, led by psychologist Candice Odgers, argue that the correlation between social media use and mental health issues does not prove causation. The author counters this by pointing to experimental studies showing that reducing social media use can improve mental health. The author also addresses Odgers' suggestion that social ills, such as racism and economic hardship, are the real causes of the mental health crisis among young people, arguing that this explanation does not fit the available facts. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of continuing the academic debate and engaging with each other's arguments to make progress in understanding the impact of social media on teenage mental health.

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article discusses the setup process of Windows 98 and explains why it has different appearances during different stages. The setup process consists of three main phases, each running in a different operating environment.

The second phase uses this minimal Windows 3.1 to run a Windows 3 program, which copies more files and sets up the system to boot Windows 98. The third phase runs after the first boot into Windows 98 and is where personalization occurs. The article explains that the DOS portion of the installer is faking a Windows UI using a standardized VGA mode, similar to Windows 3.1. The author notes that the setup program is not a complete operating system, but praises it for its user-friendly and consistent experience.

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article discusses a mysterious bug in a search engine project that started occurring in February. The bug relates to the code that merges partial indices to construct the reverse index. The code that copies sorted numbers from one index to another started randomly failing. The author suspects that it could be a 32-bit integer overflow issue. However, after investigating and making changes, the bug still persisted. The author eventually narrowed down the issue to deterministic code behaving non-deterministically, leading to logical contradictions. They speculate that the problem could be with the JVM, the Linux kernel, or the hardware.
