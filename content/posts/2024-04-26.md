**Total comment counts : 78**

### Summary

 In this article, the author shares their personal opinion and experiences with using the Rust programming language for game development. They discuss the common argument that once you gain enough experience with Rust, everything will make sense, and explain that their extensive experience and effort in using Rust for game development has not dispelled their reservations. The author clarifies that their perspective is focused on creating commercially viable games in a relatively short time frame, rather than using game development as a means of learning Rust. They highlight their experience with using Rust for game development, as well as their work as a backend developer. The goal of the article is to serve as a reference for dispelling commonly repeated arguments and to explain why they are likely abandoning Rust as a game development tool, while still engaging in game development. The author also discusses their perception of the Rust community's focus on technical aspects over the actual game development process. They acknowledge that learning Rust comes with its own set of challenges and patterns, but express frustration with the common response of "you just don't get it yet" when facing fundamental problems with Rust.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the concern with passkeys, specifically the lack of trust in the companies that offer them. The author mentions that passkeys are often tied to a specific platform, like Apple, which can lead to lock-in issues. While passkeys provide security by preventing phishing attacks, they also pose problems if Apple deletes the key or if users want to switch devices.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author argues that discussions about Passkeys often neglect the importance of the "something you know" aspect of security. In the US, authorities have the right to obtain usernames, fingerprints, retina scans, and face IDs, but not information from one's brain. Passkeys avoid the need for "something you know" by focusing on "something you have," which the author considers a security nightmare.
