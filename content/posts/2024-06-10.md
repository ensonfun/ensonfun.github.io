### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a technique for managing branches in software development projects. The author suggests that using the head of the main branch from 21 days ago provides a predictable and modifiable future for consumers who are afraid of unpredictable events. Cherry picks are made during the build process, which avoids branch divergence. Unlike stable branches, this method automatically converges back to the main branch. The article acknowledges that if a fix is not upstreamed, it carries an ongoing cost, which represents technical debt. This approach has been successful for the past 4-5 years and is used in several projects.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author posted an update on their previous article about serving Netflix video traffic at high speeds. They mention important performance milestones, including the first CDN server with a speed of 800Gb/s using two AMD 7713 processors and a NIC kTLS offload. They also mention their plans for a future CDN server in 2023, which will have a speed of 100Gb/s and consume only 100W of power, using Nvidia Bluefield-3 and NIC kTLS offload. The author then questions whether the 2x AMD 7713 actually consumes more than 800W of power and if a Zen 5 DDR5 processor would outperform Bluefield in terms of power efficiency.

## 5. [Inline Assembly Dangers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40607845)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses a technical issue with the PS2 SDK. The author encountered a problem where loading a PS2SDK ELF, soft resetting with ps2link, and loading the ELF again would result in a crash due to a TLB miss. They found that the issue originated in the libcglue timezone startup code, and adding an empty stub solved the problem. However, months later, someone reported that their graphics were broken after a ps2link reset. The author discovered that the framebuffer and zbuffer were pointing to the same address, causing the issue. They cursed ps2link for not resetting the vram pointer inside libgraphs and recommended calling graph_vram_clear() before the first allocation. The author decided to investigate the timezone issue and traced it back to setenv() in newlib. They discovered a problem with a static local variable, and thought back to the vram allocation issue. They attempted to debug the __start routine responsible for clearing the .bss section but noticed that the code handling the zeroing was commented out. Adding newlines and fixing the formatting resolved the global variable sample and timezone issues, making soft resetting the PS2 reliable.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author describes a bug they encountered with inline assembly in a function that crashed when passed the value 4 as an argument. The function was designed to byte-swap an integer using an Intel assembly instruction. The bug occurred because the author forgot to mark the input register as dirty in the inline assembly code. This caused the compiler to treat the register as unmodified and use it as a value to add to a pointer, resulting in an invalid pointer. The bug would eventually crash when the function attempted to write another value to that invalid pointer. Inline assembly is discouraged because it is a black box for the compiler and hinders its ability to optimize instructions.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the difficulty of writing inline assembly in most programming languages and suggests that there is an opportunity to improve the experience. The author proposes a "seamless" assembly feature where assembly instructions and ISA-specific registers can be treated as first-class objects. The article also calls for improvements in tooling and LSPs (Language Server Protocols), such as providing latency/throughput information for selected assembly code blocks and performing static analysis for optimizations or refactoring actions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the evolution of understanding light and vision. It mentions that ancient Greek philosophers believed that vision occurred through beams of light emitted from the eyes, while the Arab scholar Ibn al-Haytham introduced the theory that vision results from light rays reflecting off objects and entering our eyes. This marked a pivotal shift in the comprehension of light and vision and laid the foundation for the modern scientific approach to studying light behavior. The article recommends a further reading on the topic.
