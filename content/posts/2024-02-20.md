**Total comment counts : 61**

### Summary

 Signal is making changes to enhance privacy for users. By default, your phone number will no longer be visible to everyone you chat with on Signal. People who have your number saved in their contacts will still be able to see it. Additionally, you can now create a unique username to use on Signal instead of sharing your phone number. There is also a new privacy setting that allows you to control who can find you on Signal by your phone number. These features are currently in beta and will be rolled out to all users in the coming weeks. It is important to note that these changes are optional, and users have full control over their privacy settings. Your phone number will no longer be visible in Signal to those who don't have it saved in their contacts. However, your profile name and photo will still be visible. You can change the default setting to allow everyone to see your phone number if you prefer. A new setting allows you to control who can find you by your phone number on Signal. By default, anyone who has your phone number can find you on Signal, but you can limit this by setting it to "Nobody." Overall, these changes aim to keep your phone number private on Signal and give users more control over their privacy settings.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that microservices are not primarily a performance strategy but rather a potential cost-saving and engineering coordination strategy. It suggests that scaling a monolith horizontally or using microservices with the same codebase may have similar outcomes unless there is a need to underscale certain functionalities. However, cost savings only become significant at large scales, and having a minimum of 3 replicas is necessary for resiliency. The main benefit of using microservices is seen in better engineering coordination, as a single team can own the monolith and maintain its cleanliness, whereas a shared monolith becomes difficult to manage.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the lack of focus on building simple monoliths at a recent tech conference. It mentions a talk about microservices by David Schmitz that humorously discusses his mistakes with microservices. The talk is praised for its entertaining delivery. A link to the talk is provided.

## 3. [WebKit switching to Skia for 2d graphics rendering](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39438908)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The article discusses the efforts of the WebKit GTK and WPE ports to improve graphics performance. While previous improvements were made using a CPU-based 2D renderer, it was clear that the limits of this approach had been reached. The article explores attempts to use Cairo for GPU rendering, but it was not successful. The next option considered was Skia, a library that had been previously passed over due to API stability concerns. However, after testing Skia internally and achieving impressive results, the decision was made to switch to Skia. The Skia implementation proved to be more performant and had the potential to simplify the code and enable the implementation of new features. The article states that the Skia implementation has reached a state where it can be considered for upstreaming to WebKit, and positive feedback has been received from teams at Google, Sony, Apple, and Red Hat. The process of integrating Skia into WebKit, including CMake integration and initial Skia implementation for the WPE port, is underway. The implementation will continue to be developed and will eventually be extended to other ports that currently use Cairo.

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article is about a web development project involving the use of JavaScript, Python, WebGL, GLSL, Rust, Lua, and other programming languages. The author is revamping an old project called Line Buddy, which visually represented wait times in Disney World theme parks. The original project used an now-deprecated API library called themeparks and A-Frame. The author plans to create a simplified version of the map using OpenStreetMap data and eventually create it in 3D. For the proof of concept, the author will draw to an HTML5 canvas. They are using Rust and WebAssembly for data processing because Rust generally performs faster at large amounts of data processing. They are using wasm-pack to create a Rust library that will be used by client-side JavaScript. The author gives a step-by-step explanation of their process, including importing the WASM code, retrieving coordinates from OpenStreetMap, and parsing XML files using the osm-xml crate.

## 7. [DJI – The ART of obfuscation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39438842)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 This article discusses a study of an Android runtime (ART) hijacking mechanism used to protect the DJI Pilot Android application. The application is protected by a packer, which is designed to prevent static analysis of the application code. The article explains the different stages of analysis used to understand how the code is obfuscated. It also provides a Python proof-of-concept tool called DxFx for unpacking the DJI Pilot application. The analysis reveals that the packer leaves only a bootstrap code in the bytecode, which launches the application's unpacking phase. The packer logic is found in a native library called libDexHelper.so, which is also packed. The article explains how the packer is unpacked and analyzed. It discusses methods for extracting the unpacked DEX files dynamically or statically. The analysis also reveals interesting clues about the encrypted chunks in the classes.dex file. Overall, the article provides insights into the protection mechanism implemented in the DJI Pilot application.

 The article describes Kenwood House, a free-entry location in London, which is located near Hampstead Heath. Hampstead Heath is a large heathland and forest area, spanning approximately 800 acres, and it is ideal for long walks or running. The area offers hilly terrains with legally protected views of London. Despite being close to the city center, roughly 10-15 minutes away from Kings Cross on the tube, it provides ample outdoor space and is recommended for those seeking a place for outdoor activities during their visit to London.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the motivation behind building houses on a bridge, specifically in relation to the City walls. The author finds it intriguing that houses were built on the bridge, as it is an interzone area that normally wouldn't exist. The typical reason given for building on the bridge is that space inside the City walls was limited. However, the author finds it more interesting that the bridge itself was considered part of the City walls, like a peninsular jutting out. Another reason mentioned is the high foot traffic, cattle, and long crossing times, which would necessitate the presence of shops and pubs to serve the approximately 138 dwellings on the bridge. The mention of William Gibson's Bridge Trilogy is noted as a possible influence for the author's fascination with the subject.

## 9. [Cake – C23 and Beyond (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39436623)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 This article discusses the development of a new feature called "c_type_system++" in the Cake source code. The purpose of this feature is to statically check code and prevent bugs, particularly memory bugs. The article explains that the compiler needs certain information from the programmer, such as naming conventions and documentation, to effectively check the code. To facilitate communication between the compiler and programmer, new qualifiers and methods have been created. These qualifiers and methods allow the programmer to indicate ownership and lifetime management of objects in the code. The article provides examples and rules for using these qualifiers. It also discusses the concept of view objects, which are objects that reference other objects without managing their lifetime. The article concludes by mentioning the implementation of delete functions and destructors for handling the release of resources and transferring ownership of objects in C.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that if a certain method can be applied to existing libraries and projects, it could enhance the safety of real-world C code. However, there would still be additional measures needed, such as eliminating uninitialized memory and data races, to achieve complete memory safety.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the ownership annotations on all functions, such as `fclose`, must be implemented correctly in order to note that the owned `FILE *` is moved into the call. This requirement may pose limitations as existing codebases would need to be modified with customized macros or the compiler would need to have a default "fail open" approach. The tradeoffs between these options are challenging, involving substantial developer effort or being ineffective in dealing with most of a compiled program's API surface. Additionally, the design mentioned in the article seems to focus on temporal safety rather than spatial safety.
