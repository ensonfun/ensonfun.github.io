## 2. [Cicadas are so loud, fiber optic cables can ‘hear’ them](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38500065)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 Scientists in Princeton, New Jersey are using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), a technique that tracks seismic activity, to monitor earthquakes and volcanic activity. While using DAS, they stumbled upon an unexpected use of the technology: listening to the buzzing of cicadas. Through fiber optic cables, the scientists were able to pick up the distinct frequency buzzing caused by the emergence of Brood X, a population of cicadas. This discovery suggests that DAS could be a cheap and constant way for entomologists to study and monitor insect populations. The DAS system works by analyzing the light that bounces back after a laser is fired through a fiber optic cable. The speed of light allows scientists to pinpoint where along the cable a disturbance occurs. By focusing on a loop of the cable, the system becomes more sensitive to capturing sound vibrations. This accidental observation of cicada sounds could provide valuable information about the population sizes and behavior of different insect species.

 Fiber cable can be used as a sensor by sensing reflections and comparing them to previous reflections to detect bends in the cable. By timing the arrival of reflections, the location of the bends can be calculated, and by sensing the intensity of reflections, the sharpness of the bend can be determined. This technology is already being used in commercial environments by a company called Luna Innovations. Examples of its use include detecting intruders in restricted areas, monitoring pipelines for drilling attempts or other vibrations, and assessing the structural integrity of bridges. The advantage of using fiber cable as a sensor is that it provides sensing coverage over a large area without the need for multiple sensors, power sources, or communication systems. The electronics used to extract data from the fiber are complex but can be safely housed at one end of the fiber.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author describes attending a party in Brazil during cicada season. The event took place at a country club surrounded by coffee farms and tall eucalyptus trees. The stage was large with thousands of people dancing under a tent and the sound system was extremely loud. However, when walking away from the tent towards the corners of the club, the sound of the cicadas gradually became louder and eventually overpowered the speakers. The author found this intriguing because they were not far from the speakers. Despite being loud, the sound of the cicadas created a pleasant and natural ambiance around the event, which was preferred over the distant sound of the speakers.

## 3. [Clang now makes binaries an original Pi B+ can't run](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38504134)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience with using Raspberry Pi systems, specifically an older model called the B+, and encountering issues when running C++ programs built with clang. They initially tried to run binaries from their faster Pi 4B on the original Pi B+, but encountered an "illegal instruction" error. They then attempted to build on the B+ itself, but still experienced the same issue. Simplifying the code to just declare "main()" and return also resulted in the same error. After researching, they found forum posts with various suggestions, but wanted a better solution. They decided to use a new SD card and installed clang on a fresh OS image. They discovered that the compiler was effectively cross-compiling for armv7 instead of armv6, which caused the incompatibility. By specifying that the program should be built for armv6, they were able to obtain a working binary. The author speculates that this issue may be due to a default change from version 11 to version 12 of the compiler, and suggests that perhaps not many people are still using these older systems.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the history of the ARM generation used in the original versions of the Raspberry Pi. It highlights that the ARM core used in the Raspberry Pi B+ was 11 years old when it was released in 2014. The article suggests that it is not surprising that an arch flag is needed to produce compatible code for different platforms. It also mentions that there may be a misconfiguration in the defaults shipped by the distribution, causing the correct arch not to be picked by default when building on the Raspberry Pi B+.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions a bug related to LLVM, where the issue seems similar to a bug reported in 2012 but was closed. The author also highlights that explicitly passing the target parameter results in a working program, suggesting a possible configuration bug. The bug mentioned in the linked article was likely about producing incorrect code even when the target was set correctly, which is not happening currently.
