### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recounts an experience when their son discovered a way to access the internet on a plane without paying for it. The son learned from a classmate that by changing the numbers in the Wi-Fi settings, he could get online. This was possible because American Airlines assigned IP addresses and authorized internet access based on these addresses. The author was proud of their son's resourcefulness, although they had to advise against such actions.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the plane's altitude was very stable, fluctuating only by about 20-30 feet. This stability is attributed to the accuracy of autopilots, which maintain the desired pressure altitude. Modern aircraft often use pressure altitude encoders with a resolution of either 25 feet or 10 feet, and it is likely that the 25-foot resolution is what is observed in this particular case.

## 5. [Desalination system could produce freshwater that is cheaper than tap water](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37681004)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 Engineers at MIT and in China have developed a solar desalination system that can turn seawater into drinking water. The system uses natural sunlight to heat saltwater, causing it to evaporate and leave the salt behind. The resulting vapor is then condensed and collected as pure, drinkable water. The device is designed to mimic the ocean's thermohaline circulation, allowing water to circulate and preventing salt accumulation. The system has a higher water-production rate and salt-rejection rate than other passive solar desalination concepts currently being tested. The researchers estimate that a scaled-up version could produce 4 to 6 liters of drinking water per hour and last several years before needing replacement parts, making it cheaper than tap water.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a new device that can desalinate water by removing salt and other contaminants. Unlike traditional desalination methods, this device doesn't produce brackish water as a waste product. Instead, it allows the leftover salt to circulate out of the system, preventing accumulation and clogging. The issue of waste disposal in desalination is a problem as dumping it back into the ocean can harm the local ecosystem due to the excess salt decreasing dissolved oxygen, suffocating animals on the seafloor. Additionally, extreme salinity makes the process of desalinating water more challenging and costly.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that even though the water produced through a specific process lacks the necessary minerals for drinking water, it could be beneficial for countries such as India, Arab countries, and northern African countries. By implementing a system to produce large quantities of this clean water and pumping it into the ground, it could help replenish the groundwater levels and potentially allow for the growth of trees in areas where it would not have been possible otherwise.
