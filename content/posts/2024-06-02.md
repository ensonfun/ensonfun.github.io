**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 Researchers at the University of Cambridge have developed a robotic device called the Third Thumb, which is a controllable prosthetic thumb that can be used to pick up and manipulate objects. The thumb is worn on the opposite side of the palm to the biological thumb and is controlled by pressure sensors placed under each big toe or foot. Over the course of five days, the researchers tested the Third Thumb on 596 participants ranging in age from three to 96 years old. Almost everyone was able to use the device successfully, with 98% of participants able to manipulate objects within the first minute of use. The researchers believe that this technology has the potential to benefit both healthy individuals who want to enhance their productivity and people with disabilities who can use it as a tool to interact with their environment. The study highlights the importance of inclusivity in the development of new technologies.

 The individual in the article broke their Achilles tendon and had to undergo full reconstruction. During the procedure, a tendon formerly responsible for moving their big toe was used to rebuild their Achilles. Initially, the person had difficulty relearning movements as trying to move their toe would result in other parts of their foot moving instead. However, following their doctor's orders of three months of bed rest and leg elevation, their muscles became weak. After months of physiotherapy in the pool and gym, the individual regained control, and their brain adjusted to the fact that the muscle now moved their foot instead of their toe. This adjustment occurred naturally without any explicit effort.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of the "curb-cut effect," where a change made to accommodate people with a specific disability ends up being more widely useful than originally anticipated. It gives examples such as ramps at intersections and closed captioning. The author wonders if the opposite could also be true. If a technology is developed for healthy individuals and becomes popular, it could potentially benefit those who actually need it. The article suggests that because healthy individuals make up a larger audience, the technology may have a broader impact when it is widely adopted.

**Total comment counts : 45**

### Summary

 The article discusses the experience of getting a sofa repaired instead of buying a new one. It highlights the decline in the quality of modern sofas and attributes it to globalization, cheap labor, and profit-driven practices. The author praises a small local business called Luxcious that provides high-quality repairs at a fair price. The article argues for the importance of resilient and humane "lifestyle businesses" and expresses a desire for political parties that support and promote such businesses.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the difference between small businesses and big brands. It argues that the perception that small businesses offer better quality at a higher price is not necessarily true. The main issue between the two is predictability. While small businesses can provide excellent service, it is not guaranteed for every business. This leads to an unsustainable system where some neighborhoods are better served than others. Additionally, the article mentions that when a small business gains popularity, they may struggle to meet the demand, potentially resulting in refusing customers or raising prices. In conclusion, the article suggests that the criticism of small businesses as "lifestyle businesses" is meant to highlight their elitist nature and lack of scalability compared to big brands.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 5. [Show HN: Open-source load balancer for llama.cpp](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40550059)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 This article discusses an open-source load balancer and reverse proxy called Paddler that is specifically designed to optimize servers running llama.cpp. It explains that typical load balancing strategies are not effective for llama.cpp servers due to their need for continuous batching and concurrent requests. Paddler overcomes this by maintaining a stateful load balancer that is aware of each server's available slots, ensuring efficient request distribution. It also uses agents to monitor the health of individual llama.cpp instances and supports dynamic addition or removal of servers for integration with autoscaling tools. The article provides instructions on how to download or build Paddler and install the agent alongside llama.cpp. It mentions that the load balancer collects data from agents and exposes a reverse proxy to the outside world, and provides information on enabling a dashboard to monitor the status of the agents.

## 10. [How to Distribute Postgres Geographically](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40542940)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 This article discusses a pattern for distributing Postgres databases to multiple regions or clouds. The pattern involves separating the data into "tenant" data and "control plane" data. The control plane data, which includes tables like users and memberships, is kept in a central region, while the tenant data is distributed based on the region with which each tenant has an affinity. This allows for faster access to tenant data by connecting to the appropriate region. The article provides an example of how this pattern can be implemented for a multi-tenant SaaS service.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of partitioned tables and the postgres_fdw method for sharding tenant-clustered tables. However, the approach was found to be unwieldy, and routing queries in the application was deemed more preferable due to greater control and flexibility. The article also highlights the risks involved with complex routing in Postgres, particularly in handling issues that may arise during load-bearing cross-Postgres-instance queries. The author expresses confidence in their team's ability to write fault tolerance in the application rather than relying on Postgres internal logic.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author raises concerns about the manageability of sharding data into loosely coupled silos. They question how to handle consistent backups, locking mechanisms, zone/region failures, hot spots, and schema changes in a distributed system. The author suggests using a system that is designed for such use cases, like CockroachDB's multi-region feature, to ensure reliability and security. The author acknowledges that full data domiciling would require even stricter measures, but they are not aware of any system that can span the globe while remaining performant without sharing metadata or caching between regions.
