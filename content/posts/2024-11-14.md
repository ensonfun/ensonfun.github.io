## 1. [MomBoard: E-ink display for a parent with amnesia](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42135520)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 The article describes the setup of an e-ink display in the apartment of the author's mother, who suffers from permanent anterograde amnesia following surgery. This condition leaves her unable to form new long-term memories, causing her to live with constant anxiety about her children's whereabouts and well-being. Traditional reminders like paper notes were ineffective due to her memory issues.

To address this, the author installed a BOOX Note Air2, an e-ink tablet with Wi-Fi, to display messages from her children continuously. The device was chosen for its clear, legible display, reasonable price, and the ability to automatically open a web browser to a specific page. The setup includes:

1. **A simple website** with two pages: one for displaying messages ("Board page") and another for composing messages ("Compose page").
2. **The Board page** uses HTML and CSS to show messages, with minimal JavaScript to ensure resilience and simplicity. It refreshes to prevent e-ink burn-in.
3. **The Compose page** is designed for mobile use, allowing the author and siblings to update messages easily from anywhere.

This system has been successful for two years, helping the author's mother manage her anxiety by providing a constant visual reminder that her children are safe and well. The author shares this setup hoping it might help others in similar situations with loved ones suffering from amnesia but not dementia.
