The article aims to provide a technical but accessible explanation of FHE and its current state and direction.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of the double-CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) in the context of RNS encoding. It clarifies that the term "double-CRT" refers to the storage and computation of polynomials, rather than the RNS encoding itself. The article explains how the polynomial Φm(X) can be decomposed into products X − ζi, similar to how the integer modulus Q is decomposed into primes. It also mentions that the double-CRT can be implemented as a DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform). The article includes a link to the original paper for further reference.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that in a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) program, it is not possible to write a program that uses fewer instructions than the worst-case input. This is because doing so would reveal information about the input, which contradicts the security of the cryptography. Instead, an FHE program must compute all branches of if-statements eagerly, and then use a select statement to decide which result should be used. The select statement allows for value selection without revealing the actual value, even in encrypted form.

## 8. [X.org on NetBSD – The State of Things](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40269680)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 This article discusses the state of X11 on NetBSD and highlights the differences in how it is implemented compared to other distributions. NetBSD ships X11 as an optional monolithic package, meaning every driver is included on every system. This can sometimes require fine-tuning to ensure the correct drivers are loaded on the correct hardware. NetBSD's "xsrc" repository serves as a fork of X.Org that regularly pulls from upstream, allowing X development to happen as part of NetBSD. NetBSD also uses its own build system based on BSD makefiles, not X.Org's GNU autotools. The article mentions several NetBSD-exclusive drivers, including xf86-input-ws, which supports various pointing devices, and several accelerated drivers for SPARC and PowerPC hardware. It also mentions the retention of Nvidia's open source graphics driver for platforms with embedded Nvidia chips. The article suggests areas for improvement in NetBSD's X integration, such as better support for X clients and streamlining spell checking in the X text editor, xedit. It also suggests evaluating the inclusion of all programs from historical X.Org distributions and addressing the lack of a scalable cursor theme and high-resolution fonts for Japanese. Finally, the article mentions the absence of a screen locking program for X in NetBSD's default installation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article briefly mentions the popularity of NetBSD in Japan and seeks an explanation for its popularity in that country.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses their hope that Wayland does not replace X as the main display server. Their main reason for this is the ease of running graphical applications over a network using X. They mention that they currently use a FreeBSD desktop with virtualized Linux, OpenBSD, and Windows systems, and they have not found a way to easily run applications as if they were on the host system with Wayland.

## 10. [A company is building a giant compressed-air battery in the Australian outback](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40263711)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 Hydrostor, a Toronto-based company, is developing long-duration energy storage systems that store energy underground in the form of compressed air. The company's CEO, Curtis VanWalleghem, emphasizes the simplicity of the system, which uses existing equipment from the oil and gas industry. Long-duration storage is crucial for filling gaps in electricity generation from intermittent renewables like wind and solar. Hydrostor's first large-scale project, the Silver City Energy Storage Centre in Australia, is expected to begin construction by the end of 2024. The company is also planning the Willow Rock Energy Storage Center in California. Hydrostor's technology has already been proven through a small plant in Ontario. The long-term viability of the technology will depend on its cost compared to other storage options.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article explains that compressed air does not actually store energy, but rather stores negative entropy. It discusses a facility that separates and stores the heat of compression, which is then used to reheat the compressed air at discharge time. The energy is stored in a thermal store. However, the article mentions that there are other methods, such as pumped thermal storage, that can achieve similar results without using compressed air. The author also mentions that Google/Alphabet has a group called Malta that explores this concept of pumped thermal storage, which has no geographical limitations. The article notes that while highly compressed air can store some energy due to intermolecular repulsion, this effect should be minimal in this particular system.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is questioning the advantage of using compressed air in a water storage system, known as pumped hydro, and suggests that using only water may be a safer and simpler alternative. The author suggests that if the lower reservoir is underground, using water alone would require the generator systems to also be located underground, posing potential hazards. On the other hand, using compressed air allows for a passive below-ground system. The author seeks clarification on the advantages of using compressed air instead of water alone.
