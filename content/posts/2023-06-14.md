## 1. [New York State Senate passes prohibitions on non-competes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36329483)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The New York State Senate has approved two bills aimed at non-compete agreements; the first proposes banning all non-compete agreements, and the second proposes a limited ban of certain types. If passed by the State Assembly and signed by the Governor, the bills could become law this week. Bill No. S3100A would ban employers from entering into non-compete agreements with covered individuals and provide for legal recourse and payment for lost compensation, damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. Bill No. S6748 aims to prevent monopolies and restraints of trade by requiring employers to have a "good faith basis" to believe a non-compete agreement is enforceable. If enacted, employers would be required to rescind unenforceable non-compete agreements with current and former workers and provide notice that an agreement is no longer in effect.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the impact of non-compete agreements on the finance and tech industries. The use of non-competes is prevalent in the finance sector, particularly in high-frequency trading and proprietary firms that employ software professionals. In New York City, there is a common sequence of moving from one HFT/Prop firm to Big Tech and then to another HFT/Prop firm due to the duration of non-compete agreements. However, this sequence may be shortened by one step.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 New proposed bill, S6748, would prohibit employers from enforcing non-compete agreements with workers without a "good faith basis" to believe they are enforceable and highlights the need for a more general law that makes it illegal to draft any contract without a good faith belief that its provisions to be valid if tested by a court.

## 2. [I booted Linux 293k times in 21 hours](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36325986)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article reports the discovery of a Linux kernel bug that hangs on boot and the detective work involved in identifying it. The bug was detected while testing nbdkit using libguestfs. The Linux kernel program was booted in cycles of up to 10,000 times to detect the hang. The culprit was pinned down to be a regression in the printk time feature. The article concludes by suggesting that this highlights the need to rewrite the rest of the Linux kernel in Rust for increased safety and reliability.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article tells a story about a large integration test suite that began to have random failures. The team tried to use bisect to identify the issue, but the failure wasn't consistent. They tried running multiple versions of the tests overnight and used Bayesian statistics to narrow down where the failure occurred, but they found out later that the tests were more likely to pass at night, so this was not a reliable method. Ultimately, the issue was caused by a dependency turning on a feature, which was fixed by a different team.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article provides instructions for reproducing a bug in Linux 6.4 RC and suggests trying to revert a commit to see if it fixes the issue. It includes a link to a reproducible test case and notes that if the last two lines of output show an error or hang, then the bug has been reproduced.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Kicad is useful for professional-level work in designing and engineering accessible technology for disabled veterans and developing robotic systems for industrial automation. The author has been using Kicad for almost 4 years, finding it consistently improving over time. The plain text representation of project state enables improved workflows with Git, scriptable bulk edits, simpler, sharable extensions/plugins, and easier continuous integration for build artifacts.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article points out that Autodesk did not mention Linux in their notice regarding Eagle and Fusion 360. Whereas Eagle supported Linux, Fusion 360 does not. This may be a problem for some users who rely on Linux. The author disagrees with Autodesk's claim that Fusion 360 can replace Eagle, as it cannot work on Linux, and therefore suggests migrating to KiCad as an alternative.

## 4. [Serotonin booster leads to increased functional brain connectivity](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36321843)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article has been withdrawn and journalists are advised to contact the original source for any inquiries. No further information or content is provided.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article points out that most of the comments on the post are from intelligent people who believe their intelligence in one area qualifies them to have opinions in areas outside of their expertise. The author warns that this is a logical fallacy and cautions readers to be aware of this and take all suggestions and conclusions with a grain of salt.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The term "functional connectivity" means the temporal correlation between brain areas. It differs from "structural connectivity", which is the actual neural pathways between brain areas. A headline could be rephrased to say that a serotonin booster leads to increased correlation between brain activity in different areas.

## 6. [Finish your projects](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36313671)

**Total comment counts : 65**

### Summary

 The article discusses the difficulty of finishing a project and why it is important to do so. The author explains that finishing a project requires both hard work and courage. The first 90% of a project can be exciting as you focus on solving the core problem, but the last 10% involves the less glamorous tasks of documentation, user input, and bundling packages for release. The author suggests embracing this work and finding a system that works for you, as there are no shortcuts. The second challenge in finishing a project is fear, which may prevent you from exposing your work to criticism. However, the author argues that releasing your project honors your past self's sacrifice and duty to your future self while also demonstrating bravery to others. The deep satisfaction of finishing a project makes it all worthwhile.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is appreciated for its empathetic tone and focus on the emotional aspect of software development, but it could be concerning for those who feel they are being told what to do or judged for not meeting certain expectations. It may be more helpful to offer personal experiences and perspectives rather than giving prescriptive advice. It's worth considering that some people may benefit from more pointed advice, but it's important to be mindful and considerate of different perspectives.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that if you feel the pressure of completing a project and are not enjoying it anymore, it might be best to give up. The author predicts that the project will take longer than anticipated and result in less external validation or reward. Instead, the article suggests that you take a break and do something else. If you still have the intrinsic motivation for the project, your interest will return, and you can resume it with renewed energy. However, if you have lost that motivation, pushing yourself forward will only make you unhappy.

## 7. [Always the same warning signs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36325349)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Laronde, a Boston/Cambridge area biotech firm that secured hundreds of millions of dollars last year, is facing criticism and suspicion that it has major problems reproducing the data that helped raise its funding. The biotech firm touted promising results in animal model experiments for its circular-mRNA technology. However, no-one else could get the data to work, and the head of the lab involved refused to share its raw data with fellow colleagues. Key figures in management dismissed concerns about replication, blaming others for not having the "magic," raising alarms for investors.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the possibility that computer technology may have been more successful in receiving startup funding compared to biotechnology due to the former being easily understandable and involving producing output for everyday use, whereas the latter mainly involves creating tools for technicians and scientists, with a complex and confusing process from an outsider's point of view. The author questions whether biotech is a poor fit for startup funding due to its complexities.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that venture capitalists (VCs) suffer from a phenomenon called Reverse Imposter Syndrome, which is common among individuals in "elite" institutions who believe they are smart enough to be there but actually may not be. The author previously wrote about this syndrome in an article.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 According to an article by Ted Chiang in The New Yorker, large language models (LLMs) can be likened to lossy compression algorithms for the internet because they synthesize summaries that are similar to repeatedly resaving a jpeg, causing more compression artifacts due to the loss of more information each time. The quality of a model can be gauged by the willingness of a company to use its output as training material for a new model. If a model generates text of sufficient quality to train new models, it can give us confidence in the quality of that text and subsequent models.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article humorously suggests that the performance of LLM (Large Language Models) may have already peaked due to pollution of the internet and other training sources with their output.

## 9. [The Deliberate Practice Guide (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36324546)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article explains the concept of deliberate practice and how it is the best technique for achieving expert performance in any field. Deliberate practice is different from regular practice, which involves repeating a skill until it becomes mindless. Deliberate practice is laser-focused, requires paying unwavering attention to what is being done, and has the intention of making us better at a specific skill. Deliberate practice creates new physical and mental capabilities and aims at constant progress. Practitioners of deliberate practice identify areas of weakness and establish plans to improve them while measuring their performance. Deliberate practice is applicable to all fields and is the universal technique for achieving expert performance. The article also clarifies that regular practice can help maintain skills, but deliberate practice is essential for reaching an expert level and improving skills as fast as possible.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on their change of mind about deliberate practice after being pointed out by Cedric Chin that it relies on having a teacher and specific method. The author argues that in a "mushy domain", it is still worth acquiring the tacit knowledge of experts even if a specific method and coaches do not yet exist. They suggest that reading books on deliberate practice may not be helpful. The article also shares the author's unrelated thoughts on programming.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article talks about deliberate practice but fails to provide any practical information on how to do it. Instead, it reiterates commonly known facts about the topic and only offers minimal advice on using spaced repetition and the 10,000 hours concept. The author expresses disappointment in the lack of valuable information and poses the question to readers on how to actually implement deliberate practice.

## 10. [Bay Area woman is on a crusade to prove Yelp reviews can’t be trusted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36328433)

**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 error

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes Yelp's business model for seemingly hiding a large number of restaurants from their search results and only promoting those who pay for placement and reviews. The author believes that other options such as Google Maps and OpenTable are no better in terms of showing all available options. The article also touches on the problem of algorithms reinforcing the idea that there is only one "best" option, ignoring other potentially viable choices.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the current problem of fake and manipulated content is only going to get worse with the increasing use of LLM generated content. It highlights that there are currently no effective mitigations in place to stop sentiment-hacking operations, and platform owners who have the ability to integrate solutions are not motivated to take the issue seriously.
