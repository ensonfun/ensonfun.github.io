### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses support for the idea of using fake data in apps but emphasizes the need for apps to handle cases where users deny permission to access real data gracefully. The author mentions Apple's policy that apps should not punish users or exit the app in retaliation for denying permission, but should instead handle it gracefully and continue running. The author also discusses a previous policy which prohibited apps from requiring users to have an account to function. However, they note that this stance may have softened, as they are now seeing more apps that require an account to work.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that XPrivacy, a tool for rooted Android devices, has been able to control and limit app permissions for over 7 years. The author also suggests there are other modern alternatives available, although they cannot vouch for them since they have not rooted their phone in a long time. The article acknowledges that while this functionality should be mainstream, both Android and iOS still allow practices like region-locked apps and preventing screenshots of DRM content.

## 2. [If PEP 703 is accepted, Meta can commit three engineer-years to no-GIL CPython](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36643670)

**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 The text discusses the idea of minimizing the work done in the single-threaded "gather" phase at the end, by having each thread individually count in a lock-free way. It also mentions that if free threading becomes possible, it could cause threading issues even for developers who only care about single-threaded work. The text suggests that languages like Rust, which have almost-free threading with some restrictions, have fared better at making multithreading easier to use. Additionally, it discusses the potential for language-level tools to detect threading bugs and suggests implementing thread safety heuristics on top of Python's type system. The text also raises concerns about GUI toolkits and their reliance on threads, as well as the challenges of making GUI applications thread-safe. Overall, the text explores various aspects of threading in Python and discusses potential solutions and challenges.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that removing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python will not break the majority of existing Python code. According to the PEP 703, the removal of the GIL will only impact certain areas such as destructors and weak reference callbacks for code objects and top-level function objects, which will be delayed until the next cyclic garbage collection. Destructors for some objects accessed by multiple threads may also be delayed slightly due to biased reference counting, but this is rare. Existing C-API extensions will need to be rebuilt and potentially require other changes if the GIL is removed, which will be an opt-in feature by building the interpreter using "--disable-gil". The transition from GIL to non-GIL is not comparable to the Python 2 to 3 transition. The proposed changes are targeted for Python 3.13.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author praises the multiprocessing module, which they have used with success. They believe that message passing parallelism, similar to the actor model, is the best approach for handling parallelism in higher-level languages like Python, even without the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). However, the primary disadvantage of the multiprocessing module is that it uses separate processes, resulting in duplication of the author's resource-heavy Python extension in memory. They suggest that supporting threads instead of separate processes in the module could prevent this duplication, reducing memory pressure on the system.

 The article discusses rumors that the Genera software from Symbolics may be open-sourced. However, these rumors have been circulating for over a decade, with no concrete developments to date. The current owner of Symbolics has shown interest in open-sourcing Genera in the past, but no progress has been made. In the meantime, the software can still be found for hobbyist purposes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an attempt to purchase chips from a company. The company was asking for a higher price that reflected commercial rates rather than historical collectible prices. It is suggested that the company is still operating as a corporation and is protective of its intellectual property. The author, who maintains a large die photography collection, was able to obtain one die image from a third party for historical purposes.

 The author questions the need for Kubernetes (k8s) involvement in most model serving cases, as it can add unnecessary overhead. They argue that it is not applicable to any cloud, but rather to specific ones where EKS/AKS is being used.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights Nvidia's decision to focus on AI products rather than crypto products. The author appreciates Nvidia's commitment to working on what they believe in and feels that, amidst the hype around AI, this focus is refreshing.

## 5. [Matrix multiplication using only addition](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36640148)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article states that the reader does not have permission to access a specific website. It provides a link for more information on restoring access if it's believed to be an error. The article was updated on December 18, 2019.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The claim that performing matrix multiplication using only addition is advantageous because it allows for the elimination of multiplier circuits in chip design is being questioned by the author. They argue that while this may be true in simpler designs, in real-world chips, the space occupied by the multiplier is minimal. Furthermore, even if matrix multiplication can be eliminated, there are other scenarios where multiplication operations are necessary. The author recalls attending a chip design conference where NVidia showcased its GPU, and it was noted that a small portion of silicon was used for floating operations, with the majority devoted to pipelining and bit manipulation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses their appreciation for a particular style of academic writing that is accessible, full of examples, and conversational in tone. They believe that some math papers use excessive abstractions to mask the simplicity of their ideas, or they themselves have failed to understand that some concepts require the use of arcane symbols.

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article introduces LlamaIndex, which is described as a simple and flexible data framework. It is designed to connect custom data sources to large language models.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a product called Definite that focuses on the SQL component. It allows non-technical users to ask questions about their SQL database. The product achieves this by pulling in schema information and structuring it in a way that is easily understandable, analyzing prior query history to understand how data is used, and adding context from other tools used. Definite also offers a Slackbot that can parse messages in a specific channel and convert them into SQL tasks, providing answers from the database. Building a similar product would require a significant amount of work.
