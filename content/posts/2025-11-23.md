## 2. [Native Secure Enclave backed SSH keys on macOS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46025721)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 macOS Tahoe can generate and use Secure Enclave-backed SSH keys. The library /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib now implements SecurityKeyProvider, enabling SSH to load keys from the Secure Enclave (not just FIDO2 devices). You can create a biometric SSH key (TouchID), verify with list-ctk-identities, and view fingerprints. Keys can be deleted; you can download a public/private keypair (the private key is a reference to the FIDO credential; use -N "" to skip a passphrase). Public keys can go to authorized_keys or load into ssh-agent by exporting SSH_SK_PROVIDER=/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib. An exportable variant encrypts the private key for backup. Biometric flag is on/off only; no biometryCurrentSet support.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion focuses on whether SSH/private keys stored in the Secure Enclave can be backed up or exported, and the implications for security and cross-device usability.
- Concern: The main worry is that if the device is lost or damaged, non-exportable Secure Enclave keys may be unrecoverable or hard to back up, leading to access difficulties or lock-in.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from strong advocacy for Secure Enclave-backed keys and their precise, user-verified usage to concerns about backup, reliability, and cross-platform support, with alternatives like Secretive, KeyMux, and Yubikeys being debated.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 9. ["Good engineering management" is a fad](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46026939)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 Crafting Engineering Strategy argues that engineering leadership evolves with business realities, not fixed moral shifts. It traces changes from Yahoo-era hands-on opportunity navigation, to the 2010s emphasis on attracting/retaining engineers, to the post-2022 flattening and AI-driven constraints. Such transitions reshape what “good leadership” looks like, often framed as moral changes. The author identifies eight foundational engineering-management skills split into core (essential for all roles) and growth (drives career progression). Core skills include Execution (delivering projects, incidents, sprints) and Team (shaping the environment for success). The piece also points to video talks and availability on O’Reilly and Amazon.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Engineering management is repeatedly shaped by fads and morality tales that prioritize frameworks over outcomes, prompting debate about adaptability and enduring leadership.  
- Concern: These fads can foster performative behavior and misaligned incentives, eroding the effectiveness of engineering managers and their ability to deliver real outcomes.  
- Perspectives: Views range from skepticism of universal leadership standards and management fads to emphasis on adaptability, contextual alignment, empathy, and a defense of management as a necessary function.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 10. [Editing Code in Emacs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46024032)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Editing code efficiently requires a strong text-editing setup and muscle-memory, not constant fiddling. The article promotes modal editing in Emacs (either a lightweight custom system or Evil/Meow). It minimizes keystrokes, keeps fingers on the home row, and avoids arrows and the mouse. Default mode moves; insert mode types. Transitions: i to insert, C-j to command mode. Four simple custom functions exist (half-page scrolls and kill-whole-word/sexp). Commands follow Emacs conventions (f=forward-word, n=next-line, C-g=cancel). Use relative line numbers and global-hl-line-mode for orientation.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on adopting Vim-like, modal navigation/editing in Emacs (via avy-mode and related tools) to boost editing efficiency, with comparisons to traditional Emacs workflows.
- Concern: The main worry is that modal editing may not suit everyone, potentially disrupting familiar workflows and raising questions about practicality, efficiency, and mouse usage.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic advocates of avy-mode and modal editing (and recommendations of evil-mode, god-mode, lem) to skeptical or traditional users who prefer nonmodal Emacs or mixed configurations.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
