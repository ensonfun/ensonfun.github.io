## 1. [OpenAI departures: Why can’t former employees talk?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40393121)

**Total comment counts : 103**

### Summary

 OpenAI, the artificial intelligence organization, recently announced the release of its new product, ChatGPT, which can now mimic human conversation. However, the release was overshadowed by the resignations of OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, and his team leader Jan Leike. Speculation arose as to the reason for their departures, with some suggesting a shift away from a safety-focused culture at OpenAI. Former employees have remained silent due to strict non-disclosure agreements that prohibit them from criticizing the company. These agreements put their vested equity at risk, incentivizing silence. OpenAI has stated that they have not revoked equity or required signing of a release or non-disparagement agreement. The resignations of key safety team members have raised questions about OpenAI's commitment to transparency and accountability, as the company moves towards a more closed approach. The organization's mission is to ensure AI systems benefit all of humanity, but recent events have led to skepticism about their dedication to safety.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author finds it ridiculous that there is so much drama surrounding OpenAI, but they strongly oppose the company's practice of compelling employees to sign a non-disparagement agreement. They believe that this requirement, which comes with the threat of reclaiming a significant portion of the employee's compensation, should not be permissible by law. The author suggests that legal action may ultimately be required to determine the legality of such agreements.

### Summary

 Gio is a library for writing cross-platform GUIs in Go. It supports various platforms such as Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and WebAssembly. Gio is designed to have minimal dependencies and relies on platform libraries for window management, input, and GPU drawing. The library provides efficient and portable GUI development and combines cutting-edge 2D graphics technology with an immediate mode graphics paradigm. It includes a vector renderer based on the Pathfinder project implemented on OpenGL ES and Direct3D 11, and is moving towards a more efficient compute-shader-based renderer. Text and shapes are rendered using only outlines to support animations, transformed drawing, and pixel resolution independence. Development of Gio is funded by sponsorships, and users are encouraged to consider sponsoring the project or its developers directly if they find Gio useful.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses a desire for more cautious consideration when naming wireless protocols and mentions the popularity of LoRa, a wireless protocol that has been in use for approximately 10 years.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that the best fine-tuning performance is achieved by fine-tuning all weights of a neural network (NN), followed by MLPs, and then by attention heads using LoRA. The authors argue that this performance difference is due to the target module of the NN. However, the reader suggests that the performance difference could also be attributed to the fact that MLPs have more weights in transformer networks than attention heads, and therefore more weights can change. The reader wonders if randomly choosing a subset of matrices to train, regardless of their location in the network, would yield similar performance to LoRA on a module with comparable learnable weights.

## 6. [Malleable software in the age of LLMs (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40397555)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses the impact of large language models (LLMs) on the creation and distribution of software. The author suggests that LLMs will make professional developers more productive and enable end-users to develop small software tools and describe modifications to existing software without traditional programming knowledge. This could lead to changes in software creation and distribution, as well as user interaction models. The author explores the idea of hybrid interaction models where LLMs assist in constructing graphical user interfaces and envisions open-ended computational media where LLMs collaborate with users. The article emphasizes that these changes are speculative and aims to consider how LLMs can empower end-users with computation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of using current language models (LLMs) to convert natural language specifications into web scraping code. The author notes that LLMs are limited in their ability to understand the Document Object Model (DOM) and are not effective for generating scraping code unless the task is relatively simple. The author suggests using an element picker and heuristics to generate a selector or XPath query instead. The author mentions the existence of specialized models that fit vectors to each node in the DOM tree, but considers them too labor-intensive unless they are integrated into an open-source scraping library for easy use.

## 7. [38% of webpages that existed in 2013 are no longer accessible a decade later](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40397692)

**Total comment counts : 50**

### Summary

 A recent analysis by Pew Research Center investigated the phenomenon of "digital decay," which refers to the disappearance of online content over time. The study focused on three aspects: the accessibility of web pages over the past decade, the functionality of links on existing webpages, and the removal of individual posts on social media platforms. The research found that a significant portion of webpages collected from 2013 to 2023 (25%) were no longer accessible by October 2023. Additionally, the study revealed that 13% of links on government and news websites, as well as 14% of links on Wikipedia pages, pointed to sites that were no longer accessible. In terms of social media, the analysis showed that 21% of public tweets collected in real-time during spring 2023 were no longer publicly available after three months. The research methodology employed conservative criteria for determining inaccessibility, using specific error codes that indicated permanent non-functionality. Overall, the findings highlight the transient nature of online content and the challenges of preserving and accessing information in the digital age.
