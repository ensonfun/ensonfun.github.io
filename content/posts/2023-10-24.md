## 3. [Unified versus Split Diff](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37995155)

**Total comment counts : 41**

### Summary

 The author discusses the pros and cons of using a unified diff versus a split diff for code reviews. They argue that while both views can be useful for simple and small changes, they are not adequate for larger, more complex changes. The author prefers a diff view that allows them to review the code as if they were writing it, paying attention to the recently changed areas but also considering the overall codebase. They suggest a specific format where the current state of the code is shown on the left, with changes highlighted in the margins, and the unified diff for the visible portion of the codebase on the right. They express dissatisfaction with the lack of tool support for this style of review and describe their low-tech and inefficient workflow for achieving it. The author concludes by expressing a desire for easier access to code review functionalities without the need for custom tools.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is discussing different types of code reviews. They argue that for large changes, a proper code review should be done at a specific point in time, focusing on the recently changed areas. They believe that general code reviews are simply a sanity check and should be performed by a second pair of eyes. The author suggests that if commits in a pull request are properly ordered or squashed, it is easier to review incremental changes in isolation. They also mention that there are different types of code reviews, such as a sanity check review and a deep, architectural feature premerge review, and the author believes that web tools mostly provide the former type.

**Total comment counts : 58**

### Summary

 California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has ordered General Motors' Cruise unit to remove its driverless cars from state roads, citing a risk to public safety and accusing the company of misrepresenting the technology's safety. The DMV suspended Cruise's autonomous vehicle deployment and driverless testing permit due to concerns about the vehicles' performance and their ability to respond appropriately to incidents involving pedestrians. The suspension is a setback for GM and the autonomous vehicle industry as a whole. Critics of self-driving technology, such as the Transport Workers union of America, welcomed the decision. Cruise has stated that it is pausing operations to analyze and enhance the vehicle's response to incidents.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) suspending the autonomous vehicle testing permit of Cruise LLC, a self-driving car company. The suspensions are based on several factors, including the vehicles' performance being deemed unsafe, the manufacturer misrepresenting safety information, and the manufacturer engaging in practices that pose an unreasonable risk to the public. The article also mentions that Cruise attempted to withhold footage of a pedestrian injury incident from the DMV, which was later discovered by another government agency.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 According to the author, who drives a lot in San Francisco, Cruise cars do not perform well. Although they avoid collisions by driving cautiously, their behavior, such as making a left turn against traffic, slows down everyone else on the road, including emergency vehicles and public transit. Additionally, Cruise cars struggle in the rain, have difficulty handling construction, and block garages and driveways. On the other hand, Waymo vehicles are considered far superior. They drive like humans do and, although they still have some issues with weather and construction, they are able to seamlessly share the road with buses, trucks, and private cars without causing delays.

 The ControlNet model, particularly the scribble ControlNet, has been a significant advancement in compositing complex scenes with specific requirements and shapes. It eliminates the need for time-consuming masking and allows users to create a general black and white outline of their scene for desired effects. Adjusting the conditioning strength allows for tighter or fuzzier outlines. Additionally, tools like Gimp's Threshold or Inkscape Trace Bitmap can be used to create a black and white outline from existing bitmaps, expediting the scribble process.

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Password manager 1Password reported detecting suspicious activity on its Okta account, following the disclosure of a breach by the identity and authentication service. 1Password CTO Pedro Canahuati stated that no compromise of user data or sensitive systems had occurred. The company is working with Okta to determine how the attacker gained access. Security firm BeyondTrust, another Okta customer, experienced a similar attack, and it was discovered that the attacker used valid authentication cookies. The incident involved the threat actor accessing 1Password's Okta tenant and updating an identity provider. The attacker also attempted to obtain a list of 1Password users with admin rights. Since the incident, 1Password has changed its Okta settings and denied logins from non-Okta identity providers. More Okta customers may be targeted in follow-on attacks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Outsourcing Single Sign-On (SSO) not only makes it technically easier, but also allows organizations to establish contracts with reputable SSO providers. These providers are responsible for managing the documentation and ensuring the security of key material. While 1Password may already have these measures in place as part of their product offering, for most organizations, it is simpler to state that no one within the organization has access to keys, rather than relying on a single individual, like Bob, who manages the SSO server.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article talks about the transition of 1Password, a software that was originally purchased for a one-time price and stored data offline, to a cloud-based system with a subscription model. This change raises concerns about the security of users' data.
