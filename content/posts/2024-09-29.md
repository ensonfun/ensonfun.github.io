## 3. [How Discord stores trillions of messages (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41683293)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 The article details the evolution of a company's message storage system from MongoDB to Cassandra and ultimately to ScyllaDB. Initially, the switch to Cassandra was motivated by the need for scalability, fault tolerance, and low maintenance. However, as their data grew from billions of messages on 12 nodes in 2017 to trillions on 177 nodes by 2022, significant performance issues emerged. 

Problems included unpredictable latency and frequent maintenance efforts largely due to "hot partitions," where read demands on certain nodes became excessive, leading to widespread latency issues. The article describes the intricate challenges faced during maintenance tasks, particularly with compactions and garbage collection pauses inherent in Cassandra's architecture.

Ultimately, after testing ScyllaDB—a Cassandra-compatible database that avoids the garbage collection problems—improvements were observed. This prompted the company to decide to migrate all of their databases to ScyllaDB, aiming for better performance and reduced operational toil. The decision to migrate is positioned as a critical step in addressing their longstanding challenges.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The blog post critiques the handling of garbage collection (GC) in a system using Cassandra, but evidence suggests the issues stem more from the way Cassandra manages heavy deletes and how it is being used by the team. When millions of messages were deleted, only one remained in a channel, leading to the need for Cassandra to scan through numerous tombstones, which created more garbage than the JVM could handle efficiently. Additionally, despite mentioning GC tuning, it appears little tuning was done, and the system was running on an outdated version of Cassandra and JVM after recently transitioning from the Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) garbage collector.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights insights from ScyllaDB's co-founder regarding the advantages of Scylla over Cassandra. Key points include:
