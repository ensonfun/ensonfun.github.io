### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses security and design issues in file formats and protocols, focusing on:

1. **ZIP Files**: The author criticizes ZIP files for having two mechanisms to identify contents (per-file headers and central directory), which can lead to discrepancies in how different implementations interpret the archive. This dual mechanism is seen as a fundamental flaw, making ZIP files less secure and more prone to errors or malicious manipulation compared to simpler formats like tar files, which, despite their own limitations, do not suffer from this issue.

2. **MIME Parsing**: Another security concern highlighted is the parsing of MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) in email systems. The author explains how different email software handles MIME differently, particularly when the expected format rules are not followed. For example, Sendmail, Postfix, Microsoft Exchange, and Outlook have varying levels of tolerance for formatting errors, leading to potential security vulnerabilities as the interpretation of emails can differ significantly across systems.

The author argues for the importance of having formats and protocols that are "intrinsically constraining," minimizing the room for interpretation or error. They express frustration with the lack of adherence to strict standards, which can lead to security nightmares due to different software interpreting data differently. The critique extends to the notion that while flexibility in software can be beneficial (as per Postel's Law), in critical areas like security, strict adherence to a single, clear standard is essential to prevent exploitation and ensure consistency across implementations.

## 5. [Nixie Tubes (2015)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42102761)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 **Summary:**

Nixie tubes are cold cathode lamps filled with gases like neon and argon, used for displaying characters through glow discharge when voltage is applied. They were popular before the advent of modern displays like LCDs and LEDs, but are now mainly used in retro or niche applications, such as in the construction of vintage-style digital clocks. Although no longer in production, there is still a large stock of these tubes, especially smaller ones, available from old equipment and stocks in post-Soviet countries. Nixie tubes were originally used in various measurement and computing devices but were not commonly used for timekeeping until recently.

The tubes require a high voltage to operate, typically around 170V, and their color is usually orange. Modern uses blend old and new technology, with some designs incorporating contemporary elements like LEDs and microprocessors. Lifespan varies significantly with newer types having longer lives due to enhancements like mercury addition, potentially lasting much longer than the minimum specified hours if used properly. The article also mentions that the conservative estimates on Soviet nixie tube lifespans might be significantly underestimated in practice.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses three ways to acquire a nixie clock:

1. **DIY**: This involves sourcing second-hand Soviet-era tubes and either designing your own PCB or using an available kit. It's noted that this option involves working with high voltages, making it unsuitable for beginners. The IN-12 tubes are recommended for being small and relatively easy to find.

2. **Custom Made**: You can commission someone to build a handmade nixie clock, which is very costly.

3. **Mass-Produced**: Opt for a Chinese-made nixie clock, where some models use authentic nixie tubes like the IN-12, available for around $50. However, buyers should be cautious as some products advertised as nixie clocks might actually use LCD screens.

The author chose to go with the PV electronics QTC kit, along with pre-soldered tubes from eBay, which simplifies assembly and allows for easy replacement if a tube fails.
