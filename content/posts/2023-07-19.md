**Total comment counts : 62**

### Summary

 Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne will resign effective August 31 following an investigation that found "manipulation of research data" in five of his widely cited papers. The investigation revealed instances of manipulation and a culture of favoritism towards researchers who produced favorable results. The report concluded that Tessier-Lavigne did not manipulate data himself but failed to correct the scientific record when given the opportunity. He will retract or issue corrections to the five papers. Richard Saller will serve as interim president. The investigation, conducted by former deputy attorney general Mark Filip, included input from high-profile scientists. Witnesses to alleged fraud incidents at a biotech company Tessier-Lavigne co-founded refused to cooperate due to lack of anonymity guarantees. The report also criticized Tessier-Lavigne's defense and found that he did not follow up on corrections to his papers for years.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of legacy status in college admissions and its justification following the end of affirmative action. It highlights the significant number of students who are admitted to elite universities through non-meritocratic means. The researchers found that over 43% of white applicants admitted to Harvard between 2014-2019 fell into nonracial preference categories such as recruited athletes, children of Harvard graduates, financial donors, and members of faculty and staff. If these applicants were subjected to the same standards as other white applicants, nearly three-quarters of them would have been rejected. The article questions the validity of legacy preferences in light of these findings.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article questions if legacy admissions, which give preference to applicants with family ties to a university, are often a result of significant donations made by their parents. It suggests that these students may be essentially paying a high price to attend the university and indirectly subsidizing the education of other students. While the author is not against getting rid of legacy admissions, they express concerns about the potential impact on alumni donations.

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The author discusses how their organization manages a large Python codebase with nearly 28,000 modules. They use a layered architecture pattern to reduce complexity and dependencies. The codebase is organized into three main layers: clients, territories, and core. Each client and territory has its own subpackage, and the core contains code shared by all clients. By enforcing this layering, they can make changes with limited impact. They use Import Linter to ensure adherence to the layering rules. Despite some challenges and technical debt, the layered architecture has helped them maintain a healthy and manageable codebase. The author encourages others working with large Python codebases to consider adopting a layered architecture.

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The Maritime Radio Historical Society, in cooperation with the Cipher History Museum, will be sending a coded message via coast stations KPH on Saturday, July 22, 2023. The message will be encrypted with the Enigma code machine, which was used by German U-boats in the North Atlantic during World War II. Listeners are invited to try and decrypt the message, and certificates will be awarded for successful decodes. The message will be broadcasted in 5-letter groups twice and can be received on various KPH CW and RTTY frequencies. Decoding the message requires the use of a daily key and a message key. Enigma simulators are available for those who do not have access to an actual Enigma machine. Certificates will be awarded for the first person to decode the message, successful decodes using original or replica hardware, and all other successful decodes. The decoded message must be submitted within 72 hours to be eligible for a certificate.
