## 5. [Tiny Language Models Come of Age](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37787350)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Researchers from Microsoft have developed a new method for training small language models by specifically feeding them children's stories. The researchers found that small models trained on these stories quickly learned to tell consistent and grammatical stories. By using synthetic stories generated by large language models, the researchers were able to create a library of training data that could be used to train smaller models. These small models were evaluated using a testing procedure that involved generating story endings and having a larger language model grade them. The results showed that even small models were capable of producing coherent stories. The researchers hope that their work will inspire further exploration of training different models on the TinyStories data set and lead to a better understanding of the role of model size in language models.

### Top 1 Comment Summary
