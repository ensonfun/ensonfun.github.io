## 1. [The future of kdb+?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41143764)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The author discusses the use cases for kdb+, a database technology, including historical market data storage, local quant analysis, real-time streaming calculation engines, and distributed computing. They argue that most users don't actually need the speed of kdb+ and that competitors are now fast enough. They predict that kdb+ will struggle to attract new clients and that Python-based tools like DuckDB and Polars will become more popular for local quant analysis. In terms of combining streaming with historical data, the author believes that other technologies like Kafka, Flink, and RisingWave are gaining traction. They conclude that while kdb+ is a great technology, other open-source competitors have caught up and even implemented some of its best features. The author suggests that kdb+ needs to adapt and make changes in its core technology product to stay competitive.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of using TimeScale, a postgres extension, which allows for fast and efficient handling of large amounts of tick data in financial applications. It highlights the column store and compression features, and mentions that it has good support with responsive developers. The article also mentions the drawbacks of using kdb, such as high costs and limitations in its programming language. It suggests that for ad-hoc quant analysis, kdb may be suitable, but for scheduled queries that need to be easily understood and maintained, TimeScale is a better option.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author quit a quant trading job after two weeks because they found the experience with kdb+ to be frustrating. They had issues with the coding conventions, poor documentation, and outdated technology. The author believes that quants like kdb+ because it serves a purpose as a weapon, but it is not a powerful tool for building software. They suggest that languages like LISP, C++, and Python are better options for building good software and being more productive. The author also mentions performance issues with kdb+.

## 2. ["We ran out of columns"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41146239)

**Total comment counts : 51**

### Summary

 The article talks about the author's experiences working with a codebase at their first software job. The codebase had a large legacy system, and the database played a crucial role in how the system operated. The author mentions that the database had a limit on the number of columns, and they had to create a separate table called "Merchants2" because the "Merchants" table ran out of columns. There was also a table called "SequenceKey" that was used for generating IDs for new entities. The author describes it as the "glue" that connected different tables. The article also mentions a database table called "calendar" that was filled manually and used for the login system. Additionally, the author talks about the process of dropping and uploading data into the employees table and replicating it to headquarters. The article highlights the complexity and challenges of working with this codebase and database.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes a situation at the author's first company where they had a complex Visual Basic (VB) application running on multiple customers' computers. The application had many global variables controlling its behavior. When bugs appeared in the application, they were not present in debug mode in Visual Studio. The company's solution was to install Visual Studio on each customer's computer and teach them to run the app in debug mode. However, this led to even more problems because there was no version control for the code. The code was stored on a shared disk with multiple folders, each containing different versions of the code with no logical organization. When there was a problem for a customer, a programmer had to go on-site to debug and modify the code. If the bug affected other customers, someone had to go to each customer and edit the code. As a result, each customer ended up having slightly different versions of the code, with some still having bugs that had been fixed for others.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes a developer's experience working with a large legacy codebase written in COBOL and Java. To work on the Java side of the product, developers had to check out individual files, which locked them and prevented others from doing the same. This functionality was achieved through shell scripts on a development server. Each customer had a master jar file representing the final product, and when code changes were made, developers had to manually patch the jar file by unzipping it, copying compiled files, and zipping it back up. This manual process led to inconsistencies and errors in the codebase over time. After two years, the codebase was migrated to git with proper CI (continuous integration), but the experience led the author to resign.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author acknowledges the importance of projects that archive data but believes that simply archiving is not enough. They argue that data should be made available to the public in a meaningful way. They highlight Reddit as an example, stating that Reddit wouldn't feel threatened by data backup, but would be concerned if a decentralized network of nodes made partial copies of Reddit and made it easily accessible for local-first clients and Lemmy mirrors.
