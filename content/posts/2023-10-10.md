### Summary

 Google's DDoS Response Team has noticed a significant increase in the size of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in recent years. They recently prevented an attack that was 7Â½ times larger than the previous largest attack, reaching a peak of 398 million requests per second (rps). These attacks, which began in August, targeted major infrastructure providers, including Google services and Google Cloud infrastructure. Google collaborated with industry partners to understand the attack methods and develop mitigations. The attacks utilized a novel "Rapid Reset" technique based on stream multiplexing in the HTTP/2 protocol. Google was able to mitigate the attacks by leveraging their edge capacity and updating their defenses. They also coordinated with other cloud providers and software maintainers to share intelligence and develop patches. The collective susceptibility to this attack has been designated as a high severity vulnerability. Organizations using HTTP-based workloads should verify their servers' vulnerability and apply patches to limit the impact. Google Cloud customers can take advantage of Cloud Armor's DDoS protection, which includes proactive rate limiting rules and AI-powered Adaptive Protection.

## 4. [Extreme parkour with legged robots](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37812255)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 This article discusses the challenges of teaching robots to perform parkour, which involves navigating obstacles with dynamic movements. Traditionally, engineers have tackled this problem by separately designing perception, actuation, and control systems with stringent requirements. However, humans can learn parkour without altering their biology. In this study, the authors take a similar approach by developing a robot that can perform parkour using a low-cost robot with imprecise actuation and a single front-facing depth camera. They demonstrate that a neural network policy trained in simulation can overcome imprecise sensing and actuation to achieve precise control behavior. The robot is able to perform various parkour moves such as high jumps, long jumps, handstands, and running across tilted ramps. It can also adapt to different obstacle courses.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how a single neural network policy, trained through large scale reinforcement learning in simulation, can overcome imprecise sensing and actuation to achieve highly precise control behavior. This approach is simpler compared to how Boston Dynamics operates, which involves working out all the dynamics in simulation first. The article highlights the significance of achieving vision-to-actuators control behavior in one neural network, shedding light on how animals might have evolved this ability. The author also mentions their own attempts at solving this problem in the past, using self-tuning methods, and shares their progress in running up and downhill in 2D in the 1990s.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the impressive animal-like behaviors observed in a certain subject. These behaviors include the subject hesitating, coiling its back legs, and making rapid movements to boost itself when jumping. The author wonders if these behaviors are a result of the subject being trained in animal behaviors or if they are emergent behaviors that animals naturally perform.

## 5. [The novel HTTP/2 'Rapid Reset' DDoS attack](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37830987)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article discusses a recent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that targeted Google services and Cloud customers. These attacks were larger than previous Layer 7 attacks, with the largest attack reaching 398 million requests per second. However, Google's global load balancing infrastructure successfully stopped the attacks, and there were no outages. The article explains the methodology behind Layer 7 attacks and how HTTP/2, the protocol used, can be exploited to make DDoS attacks more efficient. It discusses the "Rapid Reset" attack, where the client quickly cancels requests after sending them, which puts an asymmetrical load on the server. The article also mentions two variants of the Rapid Reset attack. The first variant cancels streams in batches, while the second variant tries to open more concurrent streams than the server advertises. Mitigation strategies are suggested, such as closing connections that exceed the concurrent stream limit. The article recommends patching software and enabling protection mechanisms like Application Load Balancer and Google Cloud Armor to defend against these attacks. The article also mentions that HTTP/3 (QUIC) is not currently being used as a DDoS attack vector at scale. Overall, the article highlights the seriousness of these attacks and the importance of implementing appropriate mitigations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes a method, proposed by Von Neumann, to obtain fair results from a biased coin. The method involves flipping the coin twice, and if the same result is obtained both times, the process is repeated. Once different results are obtained, the first element of the pair of flips is used as the result.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a study conducted to determine the probability of a fair coin landing on the same side it started after flipping. The study collected data from 350,757 coin flips and found overwhelming evidence for a "same-side" bias, where the coin is more likely to land on the same side it started. The mean estimate for this bias is 50.8%, with considerable variance among different participants. The study also mentions that betting on the outcome of coin tosses could earn an average of $19 in a series of 1000 flips. The manuscript, data, code, and video recordings from the study are available through specific links provided in the article.
