### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests two key strategies for handling rounding and time representation in code. Firstly, it recommends using consistent rounding methodologies and promoting them to a named part of the business-domain in code. This involves having separate functions and unit-tests for rounding strategies based on country codes. Secondly, it suggests using integer representations of time, such as Unix timestamps or integer-based UTC datetimes. This approach simplifies handling timestamps and avoids discrepancies caused by different libraries parsing timestamps differently. However, it should only be used for times in the past or for future delays that are completely under one's own control. The article also highlights the importance of considering factors like time zone differences and potential changes in tax schedules or national time-keeping when storing timestamps.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of using a relational database for bookkeeping systems rather than relying on high finance. It highlights the following advantages:

1. ACID compliance, which eliminates the need to create it from scratch.
2. Ability to handle arbitrary precision numeric data types with approved operations and rounding modes.
3. Efficient handling of time-related operations.
4. Computations and reporting can be performed entirely using SQL.
5. With expertise in SQL, reporting can be done elegantly.
6. The database's performance is optimized by skilled database architects.
7. The database provides tools for disaster prevention and recovery.

They state that any performance issues can be addressed more easily within the existing database framework rather than reinventing the underlying technology of reliable financial systems.

## 4. [Second Factor SMS: Worse Than Its Reputation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40934495)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) discovered a security flaw in two-factor authentication via SMS (2FA-SMS), which is commonly used to increase the security of logins. The CCC had live access to over 200 million SMS messages from more than 200 affected companies, including major companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Attackers can intercept SMS messages through techniques like SIM swapping or exploiting vulnerabilities in mobile networks. The CCC advises against using SMS as a second factor and recommends using one-time passwords generated in an app or using hardware tokens instead.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a phishing attack in which a family friend fell victim. The attacker used Google Ads to create a fraudulent login page for a bank. The victim entered her 2FA code, but the interface rejected it and asked for another code. Unbeknownst to the victim, the second code authorized the addition of a new payee, resulting in money being stolen. The author reflects on the security of SMS 2FA versus app-generated tokens and suggests that the ideal solution would be an app that generates specific tokens for different types of transactions. The article concludes with a note that the victim eventually recovered her money.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that companies that enforce SMS 2FA (two-factor authentication) may not genuinely prioritize security but rather use it as a means to obtain users' phone numbers. The implementation of 2FA is viewed as a superficial security measure that encourages users to share their phone numbers with these companies.

## 6. [Real-time audio programming 101: time waits for nothing (2011)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40912271)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article explains that writing real-time audio software for general-purpose operating systems requires adherence to certain principles. These principles are aimed at achieving stable real-time audio behavior and preventing glitches. The author highlights the need to avoid blocking the audio processing thread by performing tasks that can take a long time, such as accessing the disk or calling functions that can block. This is because real-time audio software requires a constant stream of audio samples to be played at a specific rate, and any delays can result in audio glitches. The article also mentions that low latency is important in interactive audio systems and real-time audio effects.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the reality that audio processing code is often running in a shared bus with other modules. It emphasizes that the deadline for processing audio in a buffer is not always as flexible as it seems, as the responsibility is to make the entire bus as performant as possible. The pressure to meet this performance requirement is often higher than what the buffer length suggests.
