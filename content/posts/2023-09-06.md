## 1. [Is this Duplo train track under too much tension?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37404740)

**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 The article discusses a father's concern about the tension in a train track made of duplo pieces built by his children. He asks two main questions: how to quickly determine if there is tension in the track and how to update the track to have less tension. The article provides a strategy for checking for tension based on the number of curved sections and the sum of direction vectors in the straight sections. It also suggests removing and rearranging certain pieces to make the track stress-free. The article concludes by mentioning the subjective nature of "too much tension" and suggests that a train ride can be a test of whether the tracks can handle the load.

 The article asks if there is a name for the combinatorics problem of determining how many structures can be built with N 1XM legos. The legos are considered the same if they can freely rotate. The author is unsure if this problem has been posed before and if it has a closed-form solution. They also inquire if there is a program that can generate solutions. The author notes that as N increases, the problem becomes more complex due to the rotational freedom of the legos.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's inquiry into the number of different looped track layouts that can be created using a fixed set of curved Duplo tracks. The author mentions that straight sections can be disregarded since they can always be added in pairs on opposite sides of the loop. The author's friend developed a solver to generate interesting layouts, but they never included switches. The article then refers to the math behind necklace problems, which helps determine if two track layouts are identical.

## 2. [Can LLMs learn from a single example?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37399873)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The authors noticed unusual training loss curves while fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) on multiple-choice science exam questions. The model appeared to be able to rapidly memorize examples from the dataset after seeing them just once, which contradicts prior knowledge about neural network sample efficiency. They conducted experiments to validate and understand this phenomenon, which supported the hypothesis that the models can rapidly remember inputs. This discovery implies a need to reconsider how LLMs are trained and used. The authors also discussed different training processes and the challenges posed by the rapid learning of models. They suggested possible solutions such as incorporating dropout and using rich mixtures of datasets during training. The authors encouraged further research and feedback on this topic.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the post is expressing their gratitude for the article being shared on HN (Hacker News). They mention that they have been working with neural nets for three decades and have found the rapid memorization behavior in large language models (LLMs) to be surprising. Although others have observed this behavior, they have not seen this type of analysis before. The author invites readers to ask questions or share their thoughts on the matter.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the concept of "over fitting" in data modeling. Over fitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and starts producing extreme outputs on new data. This happens when the training parameters in the model become very large, resulting in a curve that passes exactly through the training data but fails to generalize well. Over fitting is different from memorization, where large models can memorize small datasets without accurately generalizing. The article also mentions that "over confident" can refer to a model that predicted high confidence inaccurately.

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses the work of Doug Lenat, specifically his project called CYC, over a period of forty years. Lenat aimed to capture what happens in the world using logic, similar to what Aristotle and Leibniz had done. The article highlights the challenges and skepticism Lenat faced during his journey, as well as his attempts to encode knowledge into CYC. The author, Stephen Wolfram, shares his interactions with Lenat and discusses the differences between his own approach (Wolfram Language) and Lenat's CYC. Despite their different perspectives, Wolfram acknowledges Lenat's long-term dedication and accomplishments with CYC. The article concludes with the difficulties faced in establishing a collaboration between CYC and Wolfram|Alpha, and the eventual sale attempt of CYC's technology.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Doug Lenat, a pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI), passed away on August 31st. Lenat was known for his work on the CYC project, an ambitious attempt to create an expert system that could reason about the world using human common sense knowledge. Despite decades of effort and a large team, the project never achieved its goals. The inherent problem with expert systems is their brittleness, as they are limited by a fixed knowledge set. Lenat's work raises questions about the similarities between LLM-based AI systems like GPT-4, which also rely on fixed knowledge sets learned from training data. The hope for these systems is to scale up and eliminate brittleness, but it is likely that true AI will need to learn through experimentation, just like humans.
