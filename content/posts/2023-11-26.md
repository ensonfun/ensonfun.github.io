## 1. [The Dunning-Kruger effect is autocorrelation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38415252)

**Total comment counts : 70**

### Summary

 The Dunning-Kruger effect refers to the tendency for unskilled individuals to overestimate their competence. However, recent evidence suggests that the Dunning-Kruger effect may be a statistical artifact rather than a genuine psychological phenomenon. Autocorrelation, which occurs when a variable is correlated with itself, can create the illusion of the Dunning-Kruger effect. The effect was initially discovered in an experiment where participants completed a skills test and self-assessed their ability. The results were visualized in a chart that showed the difference between the participants' test scores and their perceived ability. However, closer examination reveals that the chart hides autocorrelation. The Dunning-Kruger effect may not be as reliable as previously believed, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between good rhetoric and good science.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article challenges the idea that the effect observed in a certain study is solely due to autocorrelation. It argues that the relationship between performance and evaluation of performance should not be expected to be random and independent. Instead, the article suggests that there is a consistent bias in the evaluation process. While the reasons behind this bias can be debated, dismissing the effect as a statistical artifact overlooks the non-independence of the variables.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a problem with a study called "X - Y vs X" where the authors subtracted two measures that had been transformed and bounded from 0 to 1. The article raises concerns about what happens at the extremes of these bounds and how it affects the interpretation of the data. It suggests that because the top performers are already close to the ceiling of 1, their overestimation of their performance may not be significant. The article also mentions that the graph of the data can make it look like the top performers underestimate more often. The opposite problem occurs for the worst performers. The article refers to a study called "Random Number Simulations Reveal How Random Noise Affects the Measurements and Graphical Portrayals of Self-Assessed Competency" for further information.

 This article discusses an interesting aspect of an artificial intelligence (AI) program called GPT (generative pre-trained transformer). The author notes that when asked about electricity, the AI sometimes provides a definition from the 17th century, while other times it gives a more modern explanation similar to what can be found on Wikipedia. The AI also demonstrates a knowledge gap regarding certain historical figures like Emmanuel Macron, but has extensive knowledge about LED diodes, television, and other modern concepts. The author finds this discrepancy fascinating and also mentions that the AI openly shares information about how to make sulphuric acid.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that lightning is caused by the sun's heat interacting with the earth and water. When the sun heats the earth and water, the earth dries up and smoke is formed. This smoke rises into the clouds where it mixes with fire. When the cloud is full, it bursts open and the smoke strikes the ground, creating thunder. The fire that is mixed with the smoke creates the lightning. It is emphasized that lightning is not created by the sun's rays themselves, but rather by the heat produced by the sun.

 I'm sorry, but the text you provided looks like a reference or tracking code rather than an article. Could you please provide the actual text/article that you would like me to summarize?

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author does not understand why people find the story amusing. They believe that meat, which is a complex organization of self-replicating machines, is more advanced than anything humans have built. They cannot imagine finding a less efficient or stable sentient entity amusing. The author questions if the amusement is due to the fact that humans are "wet" inside while computer chips are "dry." They suggest that this reflects the current limitations of human technology.

## 8. [Fun with DNS TXT Records](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38419272)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of the Domain Name System (DNS) to store arbitrary string attributes. It mentions that any printable ASCII character is allowed for the attribute name. Some DNS server implementations have limits on the size or number of TXT records associated with a particular owner, and some may not support TXT records at all. However, there is a way to exceed the 255-byte maximum length of a string within a single TXT record by using multiple strings. The author also mentions a method to compress and encode data using Python, base64, and zlib to reduce the size of the data. The author demonstrates the use of this method to encrypt a secret with a password and store it in a TXT record.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article clarifies that a DNS TXT record is not limited to 255 bytes as commonly believed. It explains that while a single <character-string> within the record is limited to 255 bytes, a TXT record can contain multiple <character-string> objects, which can be stitched together by the DNS client. The maximum payload length for a DNS record is 65,536 octets (64kb) due to the rdlength property, but considering the overhead of the length octet in each <character-string>, the usable characters in the TXT record is limited to 65,280 octets. The article also mentions that using TCP requests is necessary for this to work, as UDP connections typically used for DNS have a limit of about 1500 bytes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their experience in 2012 with using a TCP tunnel-over-DNS-TXT as a way to bypass captive portals on Wi-Fi networks. They used it as a tunnel for RDP traffic to their home box, but the bandwidth was slow. They mention that it is no longer possible to have a usable desktop experience through dial-up-tier RDP, and people now use their phone's tether or hotspot instead.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses both enthusiasm and frustration towards a concept called the "periodic table." They argue that the concept is more of a collection of related items rather than a true representation of a periodic table. The author suggests grouping items based on electronegativity as a proxy for additive/subtractive processes, and atomic weight as a proxy for actual weight/scale. They propose different groupings for various tools and processes. Additionally, the author mentions the importance of having groups, periodicity, and trends over adhering strictly to the shape and size of the traditional periodic table. The author also mentions that Theodore Gray, a renowned chemist and author, is associated with this concept.
