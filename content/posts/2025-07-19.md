## 1. [Asynchrony is not concurrency](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44608754)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 The article discusses the crucial distinction between asynchrony, concurrency, and parallelism in programming. Asynchrony allows tasks to run out of order correctly, while concurrency enables multiple tasks to progress simultaneously, and parallelism allows for actual simultaneous execution. The author highlights that misunderstanding these terms has led to inefficiencies and complexities in software development, such as duplication of effort in libraries and poor user experiences. They provide examples to illustrate these concepts and emphasize the importance of recognizing asynchronyâ€™s role without requiring concurrent execution, especially in languages like Zig.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Defining "async" is challenging, even for its designers in JavaScript. The author disagrees with a specific definition that equates async with correctness, highlighting potential race conditions in async code. They propose that async implies an explicit structure for concurrency, though they believe this definition still needs refinement. Further thoughts on the topic are shared in a linked post.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that the concept of "yielding execution" is inherent to concurrency, and splitting it into a new term "asynchrony" introduces confusion. They argue that while the distinction may seem necessary, concurrency fundamentally relies on the ability to yield, making the separation unnecessary and potentially misleading.

## 2. [Fully homomorphic encryption and the dawn of a private internet](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44601023)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables arbitrary computations on encrypted data without the need for decryption, allowing for full data privacy during transmission and processing. Despite its impressive capabilities, FHE isn't widely used due to its slow performance, with a current overhead of 1,000x to 10,000x compared to plaintext and high storage requirements. However, advancements are accelerating, with speed improvements of 8x annually, potentially making FHE practical for encrypted cloud computing and confidential blockchain applications. This shift could transform user data handling and enhance online privacy, moving towards "Privacy by default."

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and its challenges, noting that while FHE schemes are improving, bootstrapping inherently imposes a significant speed overhead (~1000x), making it unlikely to reach plaintext performance. They highlight the difficulty in promoting hardware acceleration for FHE in an environment where computational resources are focused on large language models (LLMs). Ultimately, they suggest that confidential computing may be a more viable option than FHE for private LLM inference, despite reservations about trusting hardware.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) is crucial for protecting privacy, enabling companies to ignore government requests to access encrypted data. Unlike end-to-end encryption, FHE allows companies to process data without ever seeing the plaintext. This reinforces the notion that privacy is a fundamental human right, limiting government power over citizens engaging in democratic activities like voting and free speech.
