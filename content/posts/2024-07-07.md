## 1. [How to think in writing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40892298)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 This article discusses the connection between writing and refining one's thinking. The author argues that when ideas are put into writing, they become more precise and complete. Therefore, individuals who have not written about a topic do not have fully formed ideas about it. The article emphasizes that not all types of writing are helpful for thinking, and that writing must be approached in the right way. The author also explores the relationship between writing and mathematics, highlighting how both involve crafting language to express and improve thoughts. The article provides insights into the mental processes involved in thinking through writing and offers guidance for different types of writing. It concludes by explaining how writing enables the observation of thoughts transitioning from fluid to rigid, allowing for the examination and improvement of ideas.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is torn about the effectiveness of writing in refining thoughts. On one hand, they agree that writing can help in this regard, but on the other hand, they believe that seeking outside feedback is a more efficient way to uncover flaws in one's thoughts. They mention that the effort put into writing may uncover some flaws, but getting feedback from others can quickly reveal gaps and blind spots. The author shares their personal experience of finding flaws in a friend's thinking despite his intelligence.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses their practice of writing reflections and examining and cross-examining ideas, which they have been doing for over a decade. They argue that aimless talking, random reading, and making small notes are important parts of the process of noticing and gathering data, despite the potential for confusion and time consumption. The author also points out that this kind of thinking and writing can scare people, as they have experienced when sending an edited analysis to a cofounder who did not understand it as an examination of their startup's situation but rather as anxiety and uncertainty. The author acknowledges that questioning assumptions can be unsettling.

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of managerial competence and its implications. It highlights how competent management sets and achieves objectives while organizing and incentivizing work. The article presents a story about an inexperienced VP who voluntarily cuts his equipment budget due to a crisis but later realizes that the budget cut becomes permanent and hinders his ability to achieve objectives. It emphasizes that having a larger budget makes it easier to achieve objectives, while budget cuts or resource relinquishment are seen as losing in the game of resource allocation. The article concludes by highlighting that the cost is a significant factor in decision-making, but it does not affect the math related to achieving objectives.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an approach called "unit presidency" implemented by a company called Creo. This approach empowered employees to make decisions as if they were the president of the company. The decision-making process was based on "economic thinking" principles, focusing on the return on investment (ROI) of decisions. Consensus was generally used for decision-making, but other methods were occasionally employed. However, the unit presidency approach became less effective after the company was acquired by Kodak, due to cultural differences and the hiring of individuals who were not aligned with the company's culture. The article highlights that similar approaches have been seen in other companies, such as Intel, where decisions are made by those closest to the situation. For this approach to work well, it is important for management to provide a clear strategy for employees to execute and ensure coordination and structure within the organization.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how resources, such as money, team size, processor cycles, and memory bytes, work in a way that when you free up resources, someone else can use them instead. A well-managed system measures everyone's resource usage and sets a budget based on past usage. The article suggests that people often avoid optimizing their code because they want to deploy new functionality and can only do so if they request more resources, which may not always be granted. The article also makes a comparison to water laws in the western US that encourage farmers to waste water to secure future access to it.

## 3. [Against the burden of knowledge](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40892365)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of the burden of knowledge and its impact on the discovery of new ideas. The burden of knowledge suggests that as knowledge accumulates, it becomes harder to find new ideas because more time is spent learning old ones. The author argues that this concept is intuitive and supported by evidence such as longer encyclopedias, increasing specialization in research teams, and the average age of authors in academic journals. However, the author also points out that the burden of knowledge may not fully explain the divergence between research and productivity growth rates. The article concludes by stating that while the burden of knowledge provides a compelling explanation, there are still limitations and unanswered questions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the accumulation of astronomical observations and measurements led to the transition from the heliocentric to the geocentric system in the scientific community. The author uses the example of Kepler's career to argue that his understanding of the laws of planetary motion was not a sudden insight, but a result of tireless work and analysis of multiple measurements. The article suggests that both the geocentric and heliocentric systems lacked elegance and were in accordance with observational data, but it was through the collection of better measurements that progress was made and Kepler was able to develop a solution. The article concludes by noting that the perception of scientific theories often simplifies the process, overlooking the accumulated knowledge and collective work of generations of scientists.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that it is not difficult to come up with new ideas, but rather it is becoming harder to discuss and propose these ideas. The author cites examples in physics, economics, finance, and epistemology where certain ideas are dominating the field while others are ignored. The article argues that knowledge and new ideas are being undermined by influential individuals and even chat bots that spread misinformation.
