## 1. [The Time I Lied to the CTO and Saved the Day](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40304453)

**Total comment counts : 66**

### Summary

 The author shares a personal experience from several years ago where their company's CTO made a poor decision by outsourcing a key part of a big project to a vendor. The vendor's product was not a good fit and required heavy customization. As the project fell behind schedule and encountered issues, the author's team secretly started a skunkworks project to replace the problematic vendor integration without informing the vendor or the client. With only three people assigned to the replacement project, they worked through the holidays to rewrite the entire core system.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article advises "delivery driven" individuals who cancel holidays to keep working to stop doing so as it will eventually lead to regret. The author argues that by working during vacations, people are perpetuating a problematic business environment where companies rely on employees sacrificing their time off to sell products. The article suggests that if nobody agrees to work during holidays, companies will be forced to provide more realistic estimates and not burden employees with excessive workloads.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of a healthy company or organization in avoiding the negative outcome described in the story. It emphasizes that in a healthy company, outsourcing implementation approaches would be carefully considered, communication with the CTO would be honest, collaboration between various parties would occur, and employees would not be overworked. It suggests that in a half-healthy organization, managers may intentionally withhold information, but lying up the chain of command is generally considered bad. The article concludes by stating the importance of learning from such scenarios to handle similar situations better in the future.

The author suggests that for custom or optimized behaviors, this abstraction may not be suitable. Additionally, specific conditions, such as whether an entry has been updated or a file has been created, may require more specific checks. The author questions how the abstraction can avoid duplicate results or overlapping tasks and suggests that manual implementation might be necessary. Overall, the author is interested in the technology but raises concerns about its practicality.

## 6. [Breathwork supports emergence of altered states of consciousness](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40302200)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses the potential of circular breathwork as a non-pharmacological alternative to treat mental health disorders such as depression and PTSD. The study explores the physiological and experiential dynamics of breathwork sessions and compares two popular forms of breathwork. The results show that deliberate hyperventilation, which reduces CO2 pressure, plays a crucial role in catalyzing altered states of consciousness (ASCs) during breathwork. The ASCs evoked by breathwork were similar to those induced by psychedelics and had positive psychological and physiological effects, including improved well-being and reduced depressive symptoms. The study establishes the physiological conditions necessary for ASCs in a non-pharmacological context, shedding light on the mechanisms and potential of breathwork as a psychotherapeutic tool.

 The article discusses the author's experience with hyperoxia, which they describe as mildly psychedelic. They claim that being in a naturally euphoric state, such as during athletic activities or feeling love, can increase the effect. The author shares that while backpacking with their wife, they would climb mountains quickly and practice the Wim Hof method, which they found to be rewarding.

## 7. [UTC, Tai, and Unix Time (2001)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40306352)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article explains the difference between TAI (International Atomic Time) and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). TAI time is based on atomic clocks and is more accurate than UTC, which is also based on TAI but includes leap seconds to account for variations in Earth's rotation. The article also discusses UNIX time, the epoch used by UNIX systems, and the issues with the localtime() function not supporting leap seconds. It concludes by mentioning the need to fix these issues and provides references for further information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses three different systems for measuring time: TAI, UTC, and UT1. TAI focuses on dividing the day into fixed smaller units and ensures a consistent physical duration for each unit. UTC, on the other hand, prioritizes matching the solar day cycle on Earth by adding leap seconds. UT1 combines aspects of both systems by redefining the "second" to match the changing rate of Earth's solar day cycle.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of UNIX time and its relationship with POSIX standards. UNIX time counts the number of seconds since a specific point in time, called the epoch. This is convenient for measuring time intervals in programs. However, the POSIX standard states that each day should consist of exactly 86400 seconds. This means that in modern systems using NTP, UNIX timestamps may differ from the expected number of TAI seconds. Additionally, there is a debate about whether UNIX time should represent physical seconds or a packed encoding of a date time that can be easily mapped to a calendar day. The article highlights the choices made by POSIX and their divergence from what many people understand UNIX time to mean.

## 8. [Symbolica Computer Algebra System](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40297423)
