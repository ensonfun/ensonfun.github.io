## 1. [Land value tax in online games and virtual worlds (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40676408)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article discusses the issue of "digital land crisis" in multiplayer games with a "digital land economy". It highlights that games featuring "land-like assets" often suffer from a scarcity of land, leading to housing crises and speculators hoarding resources. This negatively affects the economy and enjoyment of the game for most players. The article suggests implementing a Land Value Tax (LVT) as a solution to combat land speculation in virtual worlds. It explains the concept of a land crisis in both real and virtual worlds and discusses the impact of land scarcity on housing costs and the economy. The article emphasizes the importance of addressing this issue in game design and proposes practical considerations for implementing LVT in virtual worlds.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a limitation of land value taxes (LVT), which is their self-defeating nature. While LVT can lower land values, removing it would benefit landowners by allowing their property to appreciate again. This creates an incentive to undo any progress made by LVT campaigns. The article suggests that overcoming the wealthy landowning class and maintaining their influence would be a challenge.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of domains and their similarities to physical land. It explains that domains are like digital land on the internet, with websites hosted on them serving as the value add. It mentions that while domains are practically infinite, some are more desirable than others. The article also explains that there are different top-level domains (TLDs) with their own rules and fees, governed by ICANN and intellectual property laws. The author suggests that domains are different from physical land and that a land value tax or harberger tax might not be suitable for domains. They express a hope for the return of personal websites and the ability for users to bring their own custom domain for online identity.

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses the first Lunar Landing game written by Jim Storer, a student in Massachusetts, just months after Neil Armstrong's moonwalk. The game involves piloting a moon lander and aiming for a gentle touch down on the moon by deciding how much fuel to burn every 10 seconds. The author of the article explores the optimal fuel burn schedule for the smoothest landing and maximum remaining fuel. They discovered a bug in the game that had gone unnoticed for 55 years and found that landing in the shortest time possible with a "suicide burn" strategy was the most fuel-efficient approach. The article also discusses the sophisticated physics and numerical computing used in the game, including the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation and a Taylor series expansion. The article concludes with a discussion about the challenges of simulating collisions between solid objects in the game and the approximation techniques used by Storer.

## 3. [Fungus breaks down ocean plastic](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40676239)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 Researchers from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research have discovered that the fungus Parengyodontium album is capable of breaking down particles of the plastic polyethylene (PE) that is commonly found in the ocean. The team cooperated with colleagues from Utrecht University, the Ocean Cleanup Foundation, and research institutes in Paris, Copenhagen, and Switzerland. The fungus joins a shortlist of plastic-degrading marine fungi, with only four species found to date. The researchers discovered that the breakdown of PE by P. album occurs at a rate of about 0.05% per day and that the fungus relies on UV light for the degradation process. While the finding is scientifically outstanding, it is not expected to pose a new environmental problem, as the amount of CO2 released by the fungus is similar to the amount released by humans while breathing. The researchers anticipate that there are other unknown fungi in deeper parts of the ocean that are also degrading plastic. This discovery is crucial as the amount of plastic waste in the ocean continues to increase.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the isolation and sequencing of a fungus called Parengyodontium album from terrestrial sources. The author provides links to photos and DNA samples of the fungus on the website inaturalist.org. The first link is at https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/147456216 and the second link is at https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/150149352.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the accumulation of microplastics in the body and raises the question of whether natural biopolymers such as cellulose and lignin have the same issue. It explores the possibility of plant microfibers accumulating in the body like plastic or asbestos fibers, and whether this accumulation persists into old age. The article also explains the breakdown of lignin by fungi and the release of enzymes and compounds that contribute to the decomposition of organic materials. This information indicates that fungi are capable of attacking plastics to some extent due to their ability to generate highly reactive oxidants.

## 4. [Edmond Albius's method of pollination is now used by all vanilla growers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40645362)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article tells the story of Edmond Albius, a 12-year-old enslaved Black boy, who discovered a method of pollinating vanilla plants by hand in 1841. This method, known as the "Albius maneuver," saved RÃ©union island's collapsing economy and turned vanilla into a global cash crop. Prior to Albius' discovery, vanilla could only be pollinated by a specific species of bee found in Mexico. The article highlights the botanical knowledge and ingenuity required for Albius' invention, and discusses the resistance and racism he faced. Today, Albius' technique is used by all vanilla growers to pollinate the flowers by hand. Despite his significant contribution, Albius was never freed by his enslaver, although he gained his liberty in 1848 when slavery was abolished in France.

## 7. [Start presentations on the second slide](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40680648)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The article suggests starting a presentation on the second slide to grab the audience's attention. This technique is borrowed from a book about writing fiction, where the first chapter is swapped with the second to create more suspense. The same concept can be applied to technical presentations, where starting with the problem or mystery hooks the audience and makes them more engaged. The article gives an example of a presentation about optimizing a virtual machine, where starting with a performance profile and the failed optimization grabs the audience's attention and makes them more interested in learning about the background and solution. The article also mentions that programmers have an inherent response to solve problems, so presenting them with a problem at the beginning of the presentation will captivate their interest.

## 10. [Lamini Memory Tuning: 10x Fewer Hallucinations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40675577)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of general-purpose language models (LLMs) and introduces a solution called Lamini Memory Tuning. General-purpose LLMs are trained to reduce average error but struggle with specific facts, resulting in inaccuracies and hallucinations. Lamini Memory Tuning optimizes for zero error on specific facts, allowing the model to recall them accurately while maintaining its ability to generalize and produce fluent prose. It combines methods from information retrieval and AI to teach the model that nearly right answers are still wrong. This approach effectively fine-tunes open-source LLMs to be near-perfect on facts while still performing well on other tasks. Lamini Memory Tuning uses a mixture of memory experts, functioning as memory for the model, and intelligently retrieves and routes relevant experts at each layer during inference. This results in a sparsely activated model called a Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) that can handle a large number of facts. The approach has been implemented in Llama 3, which was trained on 15 trillion tokens.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a creative and interesting idea involving training fact-based LoRAs to zero loss and using RAG to select the appropriate one for a query. The author suggests that a potential advantage for such a company could be proprietary fact LoRAs, essentially licensing a modern AI encyclopedia. Overall, the idea is deemed as really nice.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article questions whether AI becomes less creative and more like full-text-search when considering what qualifies as "fact" in the training data. It suggests that if everything is treated as fact, the AI model will have perfect accuracy but lack creativity.
