### Summary

 The article discusses the technique of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficiently training custom language models (LLMs). The author shares their experiments and findings related to LoRA. They highlight several key takeaways, including the consistency of outcomes across multiple runs, the trade-off between memory savings and runtime with QLoRA, the minimal impact of optimizer choice, the allocation of memory for matrix multiplications in LLMs, the potential negative effects of multi-epoch training, and the importance of applying LoRA across all layers. The author also addresses common questions about LoRA and mentions the possibility of writing a more in-depth article in the future. The article explains the concept of LoRA and how it can save memory during weight updates in LLM training. The savings depend on the rank parameter.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author questions whether considering machine learning models as a continuum, rather than distinct thresholds, is leading to incorrect "rules of thumb" in research methodology. They draw parallels between the limitations of translating mouse models to humans and applying findings from a fruit fly's brain to those of dolphins or chimpanzees. The author suggests defining "weight classes" for different types of models and grouping research accordingly. They also mention that the effects of certain techniques, like using synthetic data to prevent model collapse, may vary depending on the complexity of the model. While the article provides useful insights on fine-tuning smaller models, the author wonders how applicable the recommendations are for larger models.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the benefits of QLoRA compared to LoRA in terms of memory usage. It mentions that QLoRA is more efficient in terms of memory but takes longer in processing time. The article also states that for small LoRAs, there is almost no memory usage penalty when using Adam instead of SGD. Additionally, the article mentions that multiple training epochs can lower performance due to overfitting, but further investigation is needed. The article suggests that the best results for LoRA are achieved with alpha = 2r. Lastly, it states that better datasets yield better results, with 1k LIMA giving better results than 50k Alpaca.
