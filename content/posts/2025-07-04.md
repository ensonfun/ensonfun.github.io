## 6. [That XOR Trick (2020)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44425880)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of XOR (exclusive or) in solving interview problems. It explains that XOR, a bitwise operation, has properties that can simplify problems, notably the ability to eliminate duplicate values. The author illustrates this with the problem of finding a missing number from an array of integers ranging from 1 to n, where one number is absent. By leveraging XOR's commutative and associative properties, one can effectively identify the missing number through a series of XOR operations, showcasing the elegance of XOR beyond conventional data structures.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 To calculate the XOR from 1 to n efficiently, a closed-form solution exists, avoiding loops. The formula is: `(n & ((n & 1) - 1)) + ((n ^ (n >> 1)) & 1)`. A more readable version is: `[n, 1, n + 1, 0][n % 4]`, illustrating a cyclic pattern of length four. This pattern emerges from the properties of XOR when starting with a number divisible by four and consistently XORing with its successive integers, ultimately forming cycles: n, 1, n + 1, 0, then repeats.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the application of XOR in verifying the integrity of reciprocal links within Redis Vector Sets' HNSW graph, crucial for preventing crashes. Each node must have bidirectional links, and instead of slow serialization, the graph is serialized directly. The author employs XOR to determine link reciprocity by normalizing and accumulating link IDs, using a strong hash function to minimize collision risks. The technique extends the applicability of XOR and could serve as an advanced interview question, showcasing its potential in reciprocal links testing.

### Summary

 Netflix has introduced AV1 Film Grain Synthesis (FGS) to enhance video streaming quality while minimizing data usage. This innovative technology captures and preserves film grain's artistic integrity, improving the viewing experience. FGS uses two components: a model that replicates film grain patterns and a scaling function that controls grain intensity based on lighting conditions. By denoising videos before encoding, FGS significantly reduces bitrate—showing a 66% reduction in the case of a specific Netflix title—while maintaining high-quality visuals and reducing compression artifacts. This advancement marks a major step in optimizing streaming efficiency.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that synthesized noise often lacks the detail present in original noise, leading to a loss of resolution in video encoding. High-quality encodes that retain original noise show a significant increase in clarity compared to those that artificially recreate noise. Lossy encodes that discard original detail in favor of aesthetic noise result in a blurrier viewing experience, especially at 24 fps. The effectiveness of codecs like h.265 or AV1 in preserving detail across frames is questioned. Ultimately, it emphasizes the necessity of side-by-side video comparisons to assess noise removal's impact on detail retention.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article critiques a denoising process that adds noise, arguing it excessively blurs images, resulting in a loss of sharpness compared to the original. Additionally, the synthesized grain appears more like basic noise rather than authentic grain.
