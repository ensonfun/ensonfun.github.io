**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 Finland's Parliament has approved a law that restricts mobile phone use in primary and secondary schools, set to take effect after the summer break. While phones will generally be prohibited during class, students can request permission from teachers to use them for educational or health-related reasons. School staff are also empowered to confiscate phones if they disrupt learning. Education Minister Anders Adlercreutz assured that students' digital skills will still be supported despite these restrictions.

 In Finland and other Nordic countries, children are recognized as individuals with rights that cannot be infringed upon by adults. Current laws permit teachers to ask students to store their phones during class to minimize distractions, yet students retain rights to their personal property and freedom of expression, including using phones during breaks. The Finnish Constitution safeguards these rights, ensuring that restrictions on mobile device usage must consider free speech and confidentiality.
