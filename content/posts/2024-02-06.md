## 4. [We've already seen category 6 hurricanes â€“ scientists want to make it official](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39268106)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 Scientists are proposing the addition of a sixth category to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale due to the increasing intensity of tropical cyclones caused by climate change. The current scale, which ranks storms from tropical depression to category 5 hurricane, may not fully capture the risk posed by the most intense storms. The proposed sixth category would encompass storms with winds greater than 192 miles per hour. The authors of the study provide evidence from past storms, analysis of maximum potential intensity, and future modeling to support the creation of this new category. However, some experts argue that communication should focus on the individual hazards associated with hurricanes rather than the category of the storm. The decision to add a sixth category would require further discussion and input from various stakeholders. The intention behind the proposal is to raise awareness about the increasing risks of climate change and ensure effective communication about all hurricane-related dangers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses skepticism towards a research paper that claims tropical cyclones are becoming more intense. The author argues that there is little correlation between the most intense cyclones listed on Wikipedia and the passage of time. They also criticize the manipulation of data in the study, including subtracting wind speeds measured before 1973 and using simulations that do not accurately represent current conditions. While the author believes that cyclones may indeed be increasing in intensity and impacting new areas, they find this particular paper unconvincing and suggest that the data was manipulated to fit the desired conclusion.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article raises questions about the effectiveness of the Saffir-Simpson scale as a communication tool for hurricanes. It suggests that the scale, which categorizes hurricanes based on wind speeds, does not adequately account for potential damage from storm surges and flooding. The article also mentions the need to emphasize the concept of rapid intensification and warming waters when communicating about hurricanes, rather than just relying on category numbers. It proposes the idea of updating the Saffir-Simpson scale to better incorporate potential and assessed damage, similar to the way the Fujita Scale for tornadoes was updated in 2007. The article provides examples of situations where residents were caught off guard by the rapid intensification of hurricanes. It concludes by discussing the differences in damage that can occur based on infrastructure types in different regions, despite being warned with the same category number.

## 6. [The little SSH that sometimes couldn't (2012)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39268530)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses an interesting bug hunt related to ssh connections. The author experienced issues with ssh not working properly, specifically with log file transfers between data centers in London and Montreal. At first, it was thought to be a network issue, but after investigating further, it was determined that packet loss was not the main problem. The author noticed a pattern where file transfers either succeeded quickly or hung and timed out. After conducting tests, the author discovered that by decreasing the MTU (maximum transmission unit) value to 576, the ssh connection hang issue was resolved. However, since these were public web servers, permanently setting the MTU to 576 was not feasible. The article concludes with the observation that packet fragmentation or reassembly may be the root cause of the problem, although no evidence of fragmentation was found.

## 10. [Will satellite megaconstellations weaken earth's magnetic field?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39272884)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concerns regarding the increasing number of satellites in Earth's orbit, particularly due to the growth of SpaceX's Starlink mega-constellation. Environmentalists have raised issues such as light pollution, traffic congestion in low-Earth orbit, and ozone depletion. A new study suggests that mega-constellations could also weaken Earth's magnetic field. As satellites disintegrate in the atmosphere, they create a layer of electrically charged particles around the planet, which could have detrimental effects on the magnetosphere. The study indicates that the mass of debris from deorbited Starlink satellites is millions of times greater than natural levels of charged particles in Earth's Van Allen Belts. Researchers have already observed evidence of metal debris from satellites in the stratosphere. The researcher behind the study emphasizes the urgent need for multidisciplinary studies to understand the impact of satellite pollution on the magnetosphere.
