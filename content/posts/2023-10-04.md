**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and how they can be used to build collaborative applications. It explains that CRDTs are data structures that can be stored on different computers and allow each peer to update its own state instantly without relying on a central server. CRDTs are categorized into state-based and operation-based types, with state-based CRDTs transmitting their full state between peers. The article focuses on state-based CRDTs and introduces a primitive CRDT called the Last Write Wins Register (LWW Register), which holds a single value and overwrites it with the last value written. The article then introduces the Last Write Wins Map (LWW Map), which is a more complex CRDT that uses multiple LWW Registers to store data. The article provides code examples and visualizations to explain how these CRDTs work. It also mentions some limitations of CRDTs, such as the inability to remove information once it has been added. Overall, the article serves as an introduction to CRDTs and their applications in building collaborative apps.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the Apple ecosystem handles the compatibility between IPv4 and IPv6 networks. On macOS and iOS, a native implementation called 464XLAT is used, specifically the CLAT relay part. With a NAT64/DNS64 setup, macOS can request an AAAA (IPv6 DNS) request to ipv4only.arpa to learn the IPv6 prefix used for IPv4 compatibility on the network. If an IPv4 address is not given via DHCP, macOS will set up a local interface and translate IPv4 traffic to the corresponding IPv6 address for transmission. This allows for IPv4-only apps to function properly without requiring IPv4 infrastructure on the network. Linux also has a similar implementation using a userspace daemon called clatd, which does not rely on LD_PRELOAD hacks.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author mentions that it would be interesting to know which applications have problems with IPv6. They state that using a IPv4 IP directly is more of a user error than an application issue. The author also mentions that they stopped submitting patches enabling IPv6 functionality to projects in 2005 because everything they cared about was already working. They also note that they tried to search for information from that time period but found that search engine caches do not have that information anymore.
