## 4. [Design docs at Google (2020)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40273534)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of design docs in Google's software engineering culture. Design docs are informal documents created by the primary author(s) of a software system or application before starting the coding project. These docs outline the high-level implementation strategy, key design decisions, and trade-offs considered. Design docs serve several functions in the software development lifecycle, including early identification of design issues, achieving consensus, addressing cross-cutting concerns, scaling knowledge, and forming an organizational memory. While design docs don't follow strict guidelines, they should provide a rough overview of the project landscape, goals and non-goals, and trade-offs made. Best practices include using system-context diagrams, sketching API details, discussing data storage, avoiding excessive code, and linking to prototypes. The shape of a design doc depends on the constraint of the solution space.

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses asyncio, a trendy topic in Python that is used to handle I/O-bound programs. It explains that asyncio is built on top of Python Generators, which are used to make code more memory efficient. Generators are defined as functions that use the yield statement to return data. The article also introduces the concept of the event loop, which is responsible for running and managing tasks in asyncio. Sample code is provided to demonstrate how generators can be used within asyncio. Overall, the article aims to help readers understand how asyncio works by building a simplified version using Python generators.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of "busy waiting" in event loops. It mentions a toy implementation that handles it correctly by tracking the next-runnable times of tasks in sorted order. If nothing is currently runnable, the event loop can be put to sleep. The implementation was later extended to allow tasks to have dependencies on sockets or other things, enabling the use of select with a timeout.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how asyncio in Python allows for the replacement of the event loop with a custom implementation. In Temporal Python, workflows are represented as custom, durable asyncio event loops, enabling the use of asyncio.sleep as durable timers that can resume on another machine. The article also mentions the issue of blocking the asyncio thread with synchronous calls in Python and suggests the need for a static analysis tool to detect thread-blocking calls.

## 7. [Cold brew coffee in 3 minutes using acoustic cavitation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40284823)

**Total comment counts : 43**

### Summary

 Engineers from UNSW Sydney have developed a method to make cold brew coffee in under three minutes using sound waves. They connected a bolt-clamped transducer with a brewing basket via a metallic horn to create an ultrasonic reactor. The sound waves generate micro-jets that intensify the extraction of aroma and flavours from the ground coffee. The process can double the extraction yield and caffeine concentration compared to unsonicated samples. The technology could be adapted to existing coffee machines, allowing consumers to make cold brew at home in minutes. Additionally, coffee shops and restaurants could produce on-demand brews comparable to the 24-hour cold brews without needing large semi-industrial brewing units. The sensory study showed that a sonication time between one and three minutes creates a coffee comparable to 24-hour cold brew in terms of taste.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discovered that many coffee shops are selling cold coffee as cold brew, even though it is actually brewed hot and then refrigerated. Some shops also believe that cold brew must be served cold, which the author found to be untrue. The author was laughed at for asking for a warm cold brew in one shop and another initially refused to warm it up, claiming it would make the coffee sour (which it didn't). The author questions whether the acidity of cold brew is lower than hot-brewed coffee and wonders about the process of sonic-brew and how it compares to manually agitating cold brew.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with a cold brew coffee machine called Osma Pro. Despite the company that created it going out of business and facing criticism for its price point and performance, the author finds their machine to be effective and enjoys using it daily. The article concludes by suggesting that individuals should research their ideas to see if similar products or concepts already exist before claiming them as new.

## 10. [Faster XML Stream Processing in Go (2019)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40280875)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses XML processing and compares the speed of stream-processing huge XML files in Go, Python, and C. The author presents a baseline implementation using the standard library's encoding/xml package in Go, which takes 6.24 seconds to process the XML file. They then compare it to the performance of Python implementations using the xml.etree.ElementTree module and the lxml library. The Python implementations are faster than the Go implementation because they utilize C extensions and libraries for faster XML parsing. The author concludes that Go is about 68% slower than Python for parsing large XML files in a streaming fashion. They also implemented the same program using pure C with libxml, which takes just 0.56 seconds to process the XML file.
