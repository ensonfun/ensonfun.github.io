### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author installed a new app called Ice to replace Bartender, which was recently sold to an app mill. The app requires screen recording permissions to function properly, which the author initially trusted due to the old author's reputation. However, they now have zero trust in the new owner. Although Ice is not as configurable as Bartender, the author is still willing to accept this trade-off because they no longer support Bartender. They hope Ice continues to improve.

 The author of the article mentions that they use Hidden Bar for a specific purpose. They note that Hidden Bar works well, even though it hasn't been updated recently. However, they recently tried out a new alternative called Ice which they describe as a nice replacement with fewer issues.

## 2. [CPU Energy Meter: A tool for measuring energy consumption of Intel CPUs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40604596)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses a Linux tool called "CPU Energy Meter" that can be used to measure the power consumption of Intel CPUs at fine time intervals. The tool utilizes a feature called RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) available on Intel CPUs from Sandy Bridge generation and later. CPU Energy Meter is a fork of the Intel Power Gadget and is developed by the Software Systems Lab of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. The tool can be installed on Debian or Ubuntu using their PPA or by downloading the .deb package from GitHub. The dependencies of CPU Energy Meter are libcap and a Linux kernel with the MSR module. The tool can be run without root access and provides cumulative energy usage measurements. It can also output raw (parsable) data and has options for debugging and customizing the measurement interval.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that since kernel 3.3, the RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) interface is available through the `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap/intel-rapl/*/energy_uj` file in micro-joules. It also mentions that the powercap interface is not only limited to Intel machines but can be used on AMD machines as well. Additionally, it suggests using the "pcm" tool for a more detailed analysis of various CPU metrics, but notes that it only works with Intel CPUs. The link to the "pcm" tool is provided.

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 I'm sorry, but I can't summarize that article without more information. Can you please provide the title or a brief description of the article?

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article mentions two unrelated examples. One example is about the price of crude oil falling, while the other example relates to hand-prepared invoices and employee pay slips. The reader is questioning why this particular example was chosen.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a new semantic searching technique that focuses on filtering documents based on concepts rather than specific keywords. The author finds this approach promising, as it allows filtering for abstract concepts like price increases or rhetorical questions. They also compare this technique to training a model on rhetorical examples, suggesting that the new technique may be faster and more accurate as it only involves analyzing neural network activation instead of generating an answer based on input.

## 4. [Microsoft will switch off Recall by default after security backlash](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40610435)

**Total comment counts : 65**

### Summary

 Microsoft is making changes to its rollout of the Recall feature in response to criticism from the security and privacy community. Recall, which stores screenshots of user activity every five seconds for AI analysis, was seen as a privacy and security risk. The feature will now be an opt-in feature in the Copilot+ compatible versions of Windows and will include new security measures to better encrypt and protect the data collected. However, there are still concerns about privacy and legal risks, as well as Microsoft's overall approach to security given recent cybersecurity incidents.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the browsing history storage and tracking capabilities of different web browsers. It compares Recall, a browser extension, to Chrome/Safari/Edge browsing history. Recall stores browsing history in an encrypted database and tracks activity for a longer period of time. However, Chrome/Safari/Edge store browsing history in an unencrypted SQLite database and only track activity for the past 90 days. Despite the differences, both Recall and regular browsers are susceptible to surveillance attacks, particularly casual attacks facilitated by Recall's speed, ease, and visual nature.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that Microsoft should make an actual product, rather than offering it for free or as a subscription service. It suggests that Microsoft should take market risks and sell the product on the Windows Store. The author also mentions that doing so could help alleviate concerns about Microsoft's market power. They propose that letting the market decide the fate of the product would be a good approach.

## 5. [AI in software engineering at Google: Progress and the path ahead](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40601116)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article discusses how AI-based assistance is transforming software engineering at Google. It highlights the advancements in machine learning and deep learning that have made AI remarkably effective in fields like computer vision and language translation. The focus is on the use of machine learning in code completion, with ML-based autocomplete being widely used by software engineers. The article presents the improvements made in Google's internal software development tools and discusses future changes expected in the next five years. It also outlines the methodology for building AI products that deliver value for professional software development. The article emphasizes the importance of improving user experience with code completion and measuring impact. It mentions that AI-based assistance now completes an equal amount of code characters as manually typed by developers. The improvements have come from larger models with improved coding capabilities, heuristics for context construction, and tuning models on usage logs. The article concludes by discussing the continued increase in the fraction of code created with AI assistance and the use of extensive internal software engineering activity logs for data analysis.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the two main ways in which AI can be helpful in software development. Firstly, AI can make non-controversial fixes that save time and reduce cognitive load for developers, such as code completion. Secondly, AI can suggest ideas that make developers smarter and more knowledgeable, even if the suggestions are not always used. However, the article argues that AI tools often fail to scale when the user has to remember to trigger the feature. The author is unsure how AI can suggest design-level and conceptual ideas without requiring a user trigger within the integrated development environment (IDE). The article briefly mentions an example of automated comment resolution but notes that it is not particularly high level and occurs in the outer flow of code review. The author finds the inner flow, where real creativity happens, to be the most interesting aspect of AI assistance in software development.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) suggestions are changing the role of code authors. With AI-based suggestions, code authors are becoming reviewers, striking a balance between the cost of review and added value. The author, an ML/backend engineer, has found this to be the case with GPT-4. They have been able to generate React UIs and Python UIs in a short period of time using GPT-4, and then review the code to understand its functioning. The author finds this AI-based code generation and review process to be very useful.

## 6. [Uganda's surveillance state is built on national ID cards](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40603692)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 I apologize, but I am unable to summarize the article as the text provided does not contain any actual content. It seems to be a prompt asking the reader to confirm that they are not a robot.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the problem in Uganda regarding National ID cards may be more related to having a surveillance state rather than the cards themselves. It mentions that most European countries have national ID cards, which are not controversial like passports. Additionally, it points out that countries without national ID cards use alternative documents and processes for identity verification that can be just as invasive. The article suggests that it is more honest to recognize the legitimate need to prove one's identity in society and to create a dedicated system for that purpose instead of relying on driving licenses.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests implementing a dual mechanism for national ID systems. This would allow individuals to have unique IDs for each relationship they establish, providing assurance of identity for business transactions. However, if a business were to leak these IDs, no harm could be done unless the business's private key is stolen. The government would only be able to establish an individual's identity but would not have access to their relationships with businesses or other individuals. Individuals would have the ability to revoke ID permissions for any relationship, and entities would not be permitted to store identifying information, similar to how they are not allowed to store credit card information.

## 7. [How Does GPT-4o Encode Images?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40608269)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The article discusses the usage of token counts and embedding vectors in OpenAI's GPT-4o model. It questions the reasoning behind the specific number of tokens used to process each 512x512 tile and suggests that image tiles may be represented as 170 consecutive embedding vectors. The article explains the concept of tokens and embedding models in the transformer model, highlighting that vectors are the actual inputs to the model. It also mentions OpenAI's CLIP embedding model that can embed both text and images into the same semantic vector space. The article speculates on the number of dimensions used internally in GPT-4o and suggests that the representation of image tiles may be a grid of tokens, possibly 13x13, with an extra token for a gestalt impression of the entire image.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author argues that there is a need for a new open-source replacement for the tesseract optical character recognition (OCR) system. They believe that current machine learning technology is more suitable for this task than the language learning models (LLMs) currently being used, which are not only excessive for the job but also have drawbacks such as hallucinations, high training and inference costs. The author highlights that the current best non-LLM solution is inadequate for accurately OCRing high-resolution scans of ASCII text in a monospaced format.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Text to Image Language Models (LLMs), like stable diffusion, work. The author wonders if these models encode RGB values into a matrix and use a helper tool to convert the data into a jpg format.

## 8. [OpenSSH introduces options to penalize undesirable behavior](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40610621)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 OpenBSD 7.6 will include a new feature in sshd(8) that penalizes problematic client behaviors. The feature monitors the exit status of child pre-auth session processes and records penalties against client addresses that show signs of attack or exploitation attempts. The penalties can include connection refusal and will increase for repeated offenses. There is also an option to exempt certain address ranges from penalties. PerSourcePenalties will be enabled by default in OpenBSD 7.6, but administrators should be aware of potential issues with NAT use.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is concerned about the potential risks and limitations of enabling certain features, such as per-address basis access control, in SSH servers. With IPv4, the author believes this could unfairly penalize innocent users as Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs) are deployed. Additionally, there is a concern that bad actors may use botnet hosts in the same network to lock the original owner out of their own server. The author argues that in the case of IPv6, where getting a new IP is easy, the described protection method will be ineffective. 

Based on the author's experiments with honeypots, they found that most attacks were basic dictionary attacks. The author suggests that these types of attacks are not a significant threat if default usernames, ports, and passwords are not used. More targeted attacks would not be caught by the proposed protection methods, so the author recommends using SSH keys as a more secure option.

The author also mentions an example of experienced sysadmins creating a test user with a weak password, which resulted in the server being hacked within 20 minutes of going online. The author argues that the proposed mechanisms would not have prevented this attack, as the attacker gained access after only a few attempts.

Finally, the author suggests reading a paper by Tatu Ylonen, the inventor of SSH, which discusses unsolved problems surrounding SSH that should be addressed. The link to the paper is provided in the article.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the risks of using an internet-facing SSH with a password and refers to using keys as a more secure and convenient alternative. The author suggests that using keys for SSH authentication is universally supported and has been the norm for a long time.

## 9. [σ-GPTs: A new approach to autoregressive models](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40608413)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article is about arXivLabs, which is a framework that allows collaborators to create and share new features for the arXiv website. Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs share the same values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv only partners with those who adhere to these values. The article also mentions that if anyone has an idea for a project that will benefit the arXiv community, they can learn more about arXivLabs. Lastly, it mentions that users can receive status notifications via email or Slack.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The authors of the article propose a modification to the autoregressive GPT model by shuffling input tokens during training and adding positional encodings. This allows the model to decode missing tokens in parallel and compute conditional probability densities for all missing tokens at once. The authors also suggest a rejection-sampling method for generating in-fill tokens. Overall, this modification has shown promising results.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of pattern emergence in image generation models and suggests that a similar dynamic may occur in longer reasoning, logic, and planning. It proposes that big ideas might become apparent first, followed by the natural filling in of interstitial details and text.

## 10. [Secret Hand Gestures in Paintings (2019)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40606924)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article states that access to PubMed Central has been blocked for the user due to their use of an automated process to retrieve content, which violates the terms of the PMC Copyright Notice. It provides information on how to request unblocking and includes contact details for the National Library of Medicine. The article also mentions web policies, FOIA, HHS Vulnerability Disclosure, help, accessibility, and careers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a hand gesture commonly seen in religious art, where a figure, often a Pope or bishop, points upwards with their index and middle finger. This gesture is unusual as pointing is typically done with the index finger alone. The use of two fingers in religious art symbolizes the divine and human natures of Christ. The article provides several examples of this gesture in religious artwork and formal photographs of the Pope throughout history, as well as its inclusion in the TV series The Young Pope.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author criticizes an article for concluding that a hand gesture is not a Masonic code without providing any reasoning for that conclusion. The author finds it surprising and doubts any reader would find the conclusion satisfactory.
