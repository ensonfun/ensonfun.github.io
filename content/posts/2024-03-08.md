## 1. [Fine tune a 70B language model at home](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39635483)

**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 Answer.AI has released a fully open-source system that allows the efficient training of a 70 billion parameter language model on a regular desktop computer with gaming GPUs. This collaboration between Answer.AI, Tim Dettmers, and Hugging Face's Titus von Koeller and Sourab Mangrulkar aims to make better models accessible to the open-source community. The system enables small labs to access large models and brings high-performance gaming GPUs, which are much cheaper than data center GPUs, into the training process. The challenge lies in the limited memory of gaming GPUs, but Answer.AI aims to overcome this hurdle to train large models. This project aligns with Answer.AI's mission to make useful AI available to everyone and empowers individuals to create their own personalized models. The organization operates as a for-profit R&D lab and aims to solve challenging problems like inexpensive and accessible large model training. Traditional academic research groups may not prioritize this work, and big tech companies and startups may not have the need to address this specific problem.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of eased tweens with a preset duration for most UI animations in game development. However, it also highlights the usefulness of another type of animation called exponential lerp for smoothing continuous and unpredictable movements without definite start or end points, such as dragging and dropping tiles on a grid or moving a camera around. The author mentions that many games, including their own, use the less accurate linear lerp and face issues when played on high-refresh-rate monitors. They appreciate the article for sharing this specific knowledge, which is often passed down orally within teams.

Additionally, enforcing complex input hampers user experience, as users are unable to generate the desired input efficiently.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the permissions required by a Chrome extension that notifies users when they change active tabs. The extension needs the "tabs" permission, which allows it to "read and change all your data on websites you visit." The author points out that while the description of this permission may sound alarming, the extension is open-source, meaning anyone can inspect the code to ensure the extension is not misusing data. However, the article also highlights the potential risks associated with future updates and changes in the extension's ownership, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance when using extensions.

### Summary

 The Thousand Character Classic is a Chinese poem that has been used since the sixth century to teach Chinese characters to children. It contains exactly one thousand characters, each used only once, arranged into 250 lines of four characters each. The poem is sung, much like an alphabet song, to help children memorize the characters. Along with the Three Character Classic and the Hundred Family Surnames, it formed the basis of literacy training in traditional China. The origins of the poem are unclear, with various stories suggesting different authors and motivations. The Thousand Character Classic was widely read in China during the first millennium and was even used to put documents in order during the Song dynasty. It also played a role in the education of the Buddhist Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho. The poem, along with the Three Character Classic and Hundred Family Surnames, was collectively known as San Bai Qian and was an important literacy text for students, particularly boys from elite backgrounds. Memorizing these texts allowed students to recognize and pronounce around 2,000 characters. The Thousand Character Classic was also introduced to Korea and played a role in the introduction of Chinese characters into the Korean language. It was used as a writing primer for children, and wooden printing blocks of the text were created in 1583.
