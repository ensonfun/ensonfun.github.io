## 1. [I pwned half of America's fast food chains simultaneously](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38933999)

**Total comment counts : 49**

### Summary

 The author successfully found exposed Firebase credentials in AI startups by searching through a list of websites using the .ai top-level domain. Their suspicion was that some startups may have overlooked proper security measures. They discovered a self-proclaimed AI hiring system that offers services to fast food chains and other hourly employers in the United States. By exploiting vulnerabilities, they were able to gain full access to the Firebase database, including sensitive data. Furthermore, they discovered that they could manipulate admin users to gain even more control over the system. The author concludes by mentioning the assistance they received in conducting this penetration test and responsibly disclosing the findings.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the author's curiosity about whether someone was hired or acting independently when conducting a pentest on the company chattr.ai. The author questions the brazenness of the person if they were acting independently and wonders if chattr.ai has a responsible disclosure policy. The author believes that people should be allowed to pentest as long as they don't intend to cause harm and report any findings. However, they note that many companies often overreact and involve the law, even if the person is acting in good faith.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The given article is a note from a user, not the author, introducing a website called Atuin. No further information or content is provided.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their appreciation for the concept of Atuin but finds it too slow when dealing with large history files. They mention having synced their own history for the past ten years, resulting in approximately 170,000 lines of history. The author finds the history search function, specifically the ctrl-r search, to be very slow. Although they acknowledge not needing most of the history, they are hesitant to manually review and audit such a large number of lines to determine what is necessary.

The code is available on GitHub, and the dataset can be found on Huggingface. The article mentions that the only thing missing is the weights, which would be helpful to have on Huggingface as well.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author discusses the core idea of MoE models and highlights that the MoE models in Table 1 have a significantly larger parameter count compared to the baseline transformer. While this may be acceptable for certain applications, it is unclear how these performance benefits would scale when the model grows to practical sizes. The author expresses interest in seeing real-life applications of scaling traditional models to 70B parameters and the possibility of parallelizing the original or the MoE model.

## 5. [Aim, fire, scan: the 80/20 of executing on big projects](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38930928)

## 6. [Ibogaine banishes PTSD, small study finds](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38933021)

**Total comment counts : 38**

### Summary

 A small trial in military veterans suggests that the psychedelic drug ibogaine could be used to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI). One month after treatment, the veterans reported a decrease in TBI symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression by over 80% on average. The study, published in Nature Medicine, did not include a control group but suggests that rigorous trials should be conducted to test the drug. Ibogaine, made from the bark of a Central African shrub, is tightly regulated in many countries and can cause fatal heartbeat irregularities. However, the available therapies for conditions like PTSD do not help everyone, so new interventions are needed. The researchers are now studying whether the drug can have a long-term benefit and are using neuroimaging and biomarkers to understand how it works. Studies in mice suggest that ibogaine can temporarily re-open a 'critical period' in which the nervous system is more malleable.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses an observational study involving veterans who went to Mexico to take ibogaine, a psychedelic drug. The study is not a phase 1 trial and lacks a control group. Other psychedelics, such as psilocybin, are being studied for their potential to treat conditions like PTSD and depression.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that while PTSD is often associated with war experiences, it can be caused by any traumatic event, such as a car crash or abuse. It defines PTSD as a fear of a traumatic memory, where individuals experience flashbacks and fear the event happening again. The most effective treatment mentioned is exposure therapy, where individuals write down the traumatic memory in full and read it until they understand it was not their fault. It also provides a link to a recent meta-analysis on the subject.

## 7. [The teen mental illness epidemic is international (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38935605)

**Total comment counts : 79**

### Summary

 The article discusses the epidemic of mental illness among American teens that began in the early 2010s and examines whether this trend is also present in other countries. The authors point out that the epidemic started simultaneously in many nations, suggesting a global event or trend rather than country-specific factors. They highlight the rise in depression and anxiety, overprotection of children, "safetyism," and the suppression of free speech on university campuses as common trends in various Anglo nations. The authors conducted research in Australia and New Zealand, discovering similar trends emerging there as well. They then hired a research assistant, Zach Rausch, to gather empirical studies from various countries and identify the international nature of the mental illness epidemic. The report concludes that teen mental health declined across the Western world in the early 2010s, especially among girls and in individualistic nations. The following parts of the report will discuss Scandinavian countries and present data from international surveys.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the increase in reported rates of teen mental illness and attributes it to the decreasing stigma surrounding mental health. It highlights the lack of resources and support available to teenagers in the past compared to the present. The article suggests that openly discussing and addressing these issues is essential in combating them.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author observes that there is a trend towards people self-diagnosing or diagnosing others with depression or mental illnesses. They are uncertain whether this is influenced by external factors or a cultural phenomenon.

## 9. [The Biggest Smallest PNG](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38908956)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article discusses the minimum required elements of the PNG image format and explores ways to optimize the compression algorithm used in PNG. It mentions that the minimum size for a PNG file is 67 bytes and discusses different valid 67-byte PNGs. The article then delves into the compression step, explaining that compression algorithms cannot always make the input shorter due to mathematical limitations. It briefly explains the DEFLATE compression algorithm used in PNG and provides insights into the contents of the compressed block. The article questions if there is a better way to compress the data and discusses the LZ77 compression strategy used by DEFLATE, which allows for overlapping backreferences. It concludes by examining the possibilities for optimizing the compression and refers to the DEFLATE specification for further exploration.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests a method to create a large PNG file consisting of a single pixel. By using empty uncompressed blocks typically used for sync flush, an arbitrary number of these blocks can be added to the file. These blocks do not affect other parts of the file but do impact the PNG checksum. The example given shows a valid DEFLATE stream that decompresses into a single byte. It also mentions that PNG IDAT chunks can be concatenated, allowing for the creation of a large PNG file consisting of a single pixel if desired.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of creating smaller PNG files that do not comply with the specifications, by omitting certain chunks or CRCs. It mentions that some browsers may still render these files, but it is unclear if this issue has been fixed in the latest versions of browsers. The author also mentions the possibility of confusing this issue with GIF files.
