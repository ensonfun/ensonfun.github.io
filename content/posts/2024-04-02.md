## 1. [Low Cost Robot Arm](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39902205)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 This article is about a low-cost robot arm that can be built for approximately $250. The arm can be controlled by building a second robot arm, referred to as the "leader arm," which controls the first arm, known as the "follower arm." The design of the leader arm is inspired by the GELLO project but is simpler to construct. The robot arm is well-suited for robot learning, and it can also fold clothes. It uses Dynamixel XL430 and XL330 servo motors, with the XL430 motors being stronger and used for the first two joints. The arm is lightweight and fast due to the use of the XL330 motors, which weigh only 18g each. Instead of the expensive U2D2 adapter, a cheaper adapter board is used for connecting the servos to a computer. The arm can be controlled with the Dynamixel SDK. Other helpful suggestions include using a discount code for purchasing from the robotis shop, adding grip tape to the gripper, and using a USB-C cable to connect the servo driver board to a computer. The assembly of the leader arm is simpler since all motors use 5v, and the gripper is replaced by a handle and a trigger. The teleoperation.py script can be used to test the arms, but the device names may need to be adjusted.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's plan to create a similarly sized arm for the purpose of making faceted glass pendants. The author mentions that repeatability is a challenge due to the need for tight tolerances and the inaccuracy introduced by each joint in the arm. They also point out the need for finer resolution than what an ungeared servo can provide and the difficulty in gearing it to balance tightness and friction. The author suggests using a cycloidal gear for the arm's gears and emphasizes the importance of using real servos with feedback for safety when handling glass. The estimated cost for building the arm is between $1,000 to $2,000, with the majority of the expense being in the gearboxes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses surprise and curiosity over the absence of a company that produces affordable, high-quality, and standardized robot arms on a large scale. They mention that while other technologies such as 3D printers and CNC machines have become accessible to consumers, this particular area remains relatively unexplored. The author speculates that there is potential for such robot arms to reach a similar scale as Arduino or Raspberry Pi but has not come across any prominent names or ecosystems in this field as of yet.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the neatness of the API for the shell function, which avoids accidental shell injection vulnerabilities by enforcing proper quoting of arguments. It provides examples in Python and the Bun API to illustrate this difference. In Python, calling the shell function without proper quoting can lead to a shell injection vulnerability, while the Bun API prevents this mistake by separating quoting from executing the command.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article states that they use both Deno and Bun in production, but on different projects. They consider both to be great upgrades from Node, especially because of their first-class support for TypeScript. Bun is particularly well-suited for large projects, as it offers improved developer experience compared to other Node-based environments. The author uses Bun for a mono-repo project with multiple frontends and a GraphQL backend, and mentions that test suites run in 5 seconds. On the other hand, Deno is praised for its compatibility with "lambda style" environments, such as their use with Supabase. The module approach in Deno allows for standalone scripts to be easily integrated.

On the other hand, they state that Datadog provides a comprehensive solution out of the box, although costs can increase if running spot instances or having many short-lived hosts. The author shares their experience with an enterprise license, where thoughtful infrastructure design has prevented excessive costs so far. They highlight the trade-off between the time and effort required to build and maintain a homegrown platform versus purchasing an enterprise plan. The author expresses a preference for building from scratch without constraints, as it would allow them to avoid being dependent on a major SaaS company that charges for ambiguous things like "per host", which could lead to unexpected price increases.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article states that while the author appreciates the product Datadog, they find it to be too expensive unless one invests significant time in cost optimization. They also express a preference for focusing on making their app robust rather than ensuring the stability of their monitoring system.

## 9. [Refix: Fast, Debuggable, Reproducible Builds](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39870121)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses a method called "refixing" that makes builds of C/C++ source code both fast and debuggable. The author explains that most people believe it is impossible for builds to be both debuggable and reproducible, so they use workarounds instead. The author proposes using a tool called debugedit, but notes that it can be slow and buggy. They then present an alternative method using sed to replace strings in the binary file. Finally, the author suggests that the size of the binary can be reduced by removing unnecessary debug information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author does not explicitly mention a specific tool called Nix, but they discuss a build system that offers reproducibility of all paths, including fixed-length paths with a chroot, and has automagic debuginfod support. The support is provided through a GitHub repository called nixseparatedebuginfod.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that the GNU memmem function is slower than the memchr::memmem::Finder function, as well as slower than most other string search functions. The musl library, however, has the fastest string search function for substrings with less than 32 characters. A comparison of different string search functions can be found at the provided link.

## 10. [Bypassing Denuvo in Hogwarts Legacy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39898205)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience with reverse engineering and bypassing the Denuvo DRM in the game Hogwarts Legacy. They explain that the game collects hardware and software features to create a fingerprint, which is then used to generate a Steam Ticket as proof of game ownership. The Steam Ticket is sent to Denuvo Servers, and if the user owns the game, a Denuvo Token is generated that allows them to run the game. The author states that their goal was not to crack the game, but rather to research and understand the DRM system. They mention using the Qiling reverse engineering framework to discover the features used in the fingerprint and patching runtime checks. The author also discusses the challenges and flaws they encountered in the reverse engineering process. Finally, they explain how they used their own hypervisor to bypass certain limitations and run the game on a different PC using the generated token.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 According to the article, there is a running tally on Reddit that keeps track of which games protected by Denuvo have been cracked. As of now, there has not been a single Denuvo game released in 2024 that has been cracked, and there are more games from 2023 that remain uncracked compared to those that have been cracked. This suggests that Denuvo is an effective anti-piracy measure for PC games.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the performance impact of a software called Denuvo, which is used to protect video games from piracy. The author suggests that Denuvo's frequent checks, which happen every few seconds, are unlikely to cause significant drops in frame rate but may contribute to issues such as frame pacing and stuttering. The article also mentions that many players have reported improvements in these issues after Denuvo's removal from games.
