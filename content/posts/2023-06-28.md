 The article discusses various questions surrounding the topic of improving particulate pollution levels outdoors around a house. The questions include the effects of trees and plants on PM2.5 pollution, whether there are plants that catch more particles and if damp leaves catch more. It also explores whether watering plants with mist can pull extra microparticles out of the air compared to a stream, and whether there are any "permaculture" solutions for air filtration. Additionally, it asks if a filter caked with PM2.5 black carbon can be useful for anything else and if a filter using home-grown plant materials can reduce PM2.5. It further explores the idea of converting a shed wall into all filtration material and pushing air out the other side under solar power, as well as the effectiveness of a giant bong in catching microparticles.
