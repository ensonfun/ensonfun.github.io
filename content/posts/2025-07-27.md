## 3. [How we rooted Copilot](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44695098)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 In April 2025, Microsoft updated Copilot Enterprise to include a live Python sandbox using Jupyter Notebook, allowing code execution on a backend. The system runs Linux commands under an 'ubuntu' user in a miniconda environment but lacks a sudo binary. While the sandbox generally executes commands well, it exhibits inconsistent behavior similar to a child. The environment includes a Go binary (goclientapp) for managing executions, and another binary for an HTTP proxy. Notably, a vulnerability in a script allows potential root access through exploitations in the $PATH variable, enabling users to execute their own code.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The reported vulnerability allowed running code with root privileges in a container designed for non-root execution. However, it had limited impact since the container remained secure, preventing network requests and breakout, meaning the main risk was the potential to disrupt one's own container access.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article critiques a post titled "How We Rooted Copilot," asserting that the authors only achieved root access in a highly restricted Python sandbox container, rather than on the Copilot core system itself. The author suggests the title should be "How We Rooted the Copilot Python Sandbox" to more accurately reflect the situation.

## 4. [Purple Earth hypothesis](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44665644)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The Purple Earth Hypothesis (PEH), proposed by Shiladitya DasSarma in 2007, posits that early photosynthetic life on Earth used retinal instead of chlorophyll, giving the biosphere a purplish hue. This is believed to have occurred 3.5 to 2.4 billion years ago, prior to significant oxygen production. Retinal pigments absorb light differently than chlorophyll, which reflects green light, leading to a green Earth. The hypothesis suggests that retinal pigments could be indicators of extraterrestrial life on exoplanets, widening the search beyond planets showing green light to those reflecting blue and red light.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Retinal-containing cell membranes mainly absorb light in the green-yellow spectrum, reflecting red and blue, leading to a magenta appearance. In contrast, chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light but not green, resulting in plants that appear green. The article questions why plants haven’t evolved to utilize both pigments for more efficient light absorption, suggesting such plants would appear dark. It also refers to an evolutionary trap for chlorophyll-based organisms that prevents them from adapting to absorb green light, which constrains their color and efficiency in light utilization.

**Total comment counts : 50**

### Summary

 Yahoo, once a leader in web navigation and information, ended its independent run in 2016, selling to Verizon for $4.8 billion, a stark decline from its peak value of $125 billion. Founded in 1994 as a directory of links, Yahoo initially thrived but faltered due to poor acquisition decisions and an inability to adapt to a changing internet landscape. Despite successful early years and profitability, its costly acquisitions, like Broadcast.com and Tumblr, failed to yield profits. Competing tech firms, notably Google, showed better acquisition strategies, leading to Yahoo’s eventual downfall.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Yahoo declined opportunities to acquire Google in 1998 for $1 million and again in 2002 for $1 billion, ultimately watching Google grow into a trillion-dollar company. In 2006, Yahoo attempted to buy Facebook for $1 billion, but Mark Zuckerberg rejected the offer; a slight increase could have swayed his board. The article suggests that had Yahoo acquired either company, they likely wouldn't have achieved their trillion-dollar status.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Yahoo was a major contributor to FreeBSD in the late 90s and early 2000s, similar to Netflix's current role. They hosted essential build and test infrastructure, employed several src committers, and made significant contributions, including the SMPng project that transformed FreeBSD into a modern multi-threaded kernel. They also employed Peter Wemm, who was instrumental in the AMD64 port. Their involvement was crucial in making FreeBSD a viable operating system.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Engineers should negotiate for higher base salaries, particularly during acquihires when equity often holds little value. They are advised to seek transparency regarding the company's 409A valuation, liquidation preferences, and pay bands. If a company is unwilling to disclose this information, it may indicate potential issues. Ultimately, while equity can be uncertain, a solid salary provides guaranteed income.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the misleading nature of acquisition headlines, specifically in the context of startups sold for millions. It highlights that the reported purchase price often doesn't reflect the actual payout to shareholders; it usually includes future share offers and incentives (golden handcuffs) to keep employees with the acquiring company. The author suggests that receiving a large upfront payment would disincentivize continued work, hence the structure of these deals.

## 8. [Resizable structs in Zig](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44697131)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article proposes a "runtime resizable struct" concept in Zig, leveraging its comptime features to manage data structures with runtime-determined sizes. Currently, Zig offers fixed-size arrays and many-item pointers but lacks a way to efficiently handle structures of varying types with sizes known only at runtime. The author illustrates the complexity of allocating and managing such data through existing methods and advocates for an improved API design to simplify these tasks, facilitating safer and more efficient data handling without introducing potential vulnerabilities. A proof-of-concept package is available on GitHub.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Zig does not include variable-length arrays (VLAs) in its language specification. Instead, it allows allocating slices on the heap or using arrays as bounded backing stores for stack data. The author notes that aligned byte-typed VLAs, akin to features in Swift, are necessary for stack allocation across ABI boundaries. They reference IBM's SOM using `alloca` in C as a historical example of this approach, concluding that they will need to find an alternative solution.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on using dynamically sized types (DSTs) in Zig but ultimately favors Zig's opaque types for improved simplicity and usability. They present an example of defining a `Connection` struct with a nested `Header`. The `init` function allocates memory for the header and an additional variable-length host, while the `host` function retrieves the host data from the allocated memory. Although the code is based on memory assumptions and may not compile, it illustrates a practical approach similar to previous experiences.

## 9. [The rise and fall of the Hanseatic League](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44656961)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The Hansa, a coalition of medieval German merchants, established Northern Europe's first long-distance trade network, enabling collective bargaining, action, and security without formal governance. Operating across thousands of miles, they signed treaties and occasionally waged wars, lasting nearly 500 years despite internal divisions. Following the Dark Ages, Europe experienced a recovery from the 800s, marked by improved agricultural techniques and climate conditions during the Medieval Warm Period, leading to population growth and the revival of artisan classes. This fostered permanent marketplaces and significant trade expansion, transforming Northern Europe's commercial landscape.

 Edward II granted Hansa merchants tax exemptions and travel freedoms for £1,000, representing a significant portion of the Crown's annual tax revenue. He assured that neither he nor future kings would impose new restrictions on the Hansa without their consent. These privileges allowed Hanseatic merchants to enjoy lower tax rates than English merchants. The article highlights ongoing issues of autocracy and lack of accountability for the wealthy.

## 10. [Getting decent error reports in Bash when you're using 'set -e'](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44666984)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The blog "Wandering Thoughts" is currently blocking access for certain web crawlers due to their generic HTTP User-Agent headers, which are perceived as suspicious. This action aims to reduce the excessive load caused by these crawlers, often used for training large language models. Effective User-Agent headers should clearly identify the software and its user, rather than presenting a vague designation like "Go-http-client/1.1."

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses enhancing error handling in scripts by using the command `trap 'caller 1' ERR`, which can help identify the location of errors. It also recommends setting error flags such as "errtrace" (-E), "nounset" (-u), and "pipefail" to improve script reliability and debugging.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an improved Bash error handling function featuring advanced features such as a backtrace for debugging. It utilizes `set -e` to exit on errors and includes a custom error message upon early startup failures. The `backtrace` function captures the state of the script when an error occurs, providing useful details about the failure context, including file names and line numbers. By employing `trap` and other Bash built-ins, it enhances the original error handling behavior, particularly in scenarios involving unexpected failures. The code demonstrates robust error reporting capabilities.
