While major religions generally oppose mind-altering substances, Indigenous cultures have used them in sacred practices for centuries. The delayed publication of the study due to conflicts of interest has now sparked renewed interest in the relationship between psychedelics and religious experiences.

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 In a blog post, Nolan Lawson emphasizes the practical benefits of web accessibility for developers, rather than just moral imperatives. He argues that accessible UI design improves debugging and understanding of elements in DevTools by simplifying HTML structure and naming conventions.

He also notes the importance of keyboard accessibility for efficient workflows. Ultimately, he makes the case that prioritizing accessibility yields better development practices while benefiting all users.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Using standard HTML elements in web development, especially within React projects, significantly improves functionality and consistency. Mixing different component libraries can lead to behavioral discrepancies, such as focus issues, inconsistent colors, and format discrepancies. In contrast, using HTML primitives ensures cohesive behavior, as they are designed to work seamlessly together by browser vendors. This approach enhances user experience by leveraging built-in tools, which are often overlooked.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article expresses disappointment over the need for selfish motivations to drive accessibility improvements. It highlights the collective benefits of a more accessible world and criticizes the mindset that dismisses accessibility efforts as "not worth it." This perspective is likened to allowing some users, like those who are blind, to suffer from system flaws, emphasizing the negative implications of such an attitude.
