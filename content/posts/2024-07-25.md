## 1. [Node.js adds experimental support for TypeScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41064351)

**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of executing TypeScript files in Node.js by using the experimental flag "--experimental-strip-types". This allows TypeScript source code to be transpiled into JavaScript source code without performing type checking and discarding types. The article also mentions a TC39 proposal for type annotations and the limitations of the current implementation. It suggests using the Swc package as a possible solution and considers adding support for source locations in error stacks. The article also addresses the issue of extension-less imports and maintaining compatibility with existing codebases. Finally, it mentions the possibility of "--strip-types" being a no-op if a certain proposal is implemented.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article states that it is not possible to remove or strip types from TypeScript without having the TypeScript grammar. This is because stripping types is not done at the token level and the TypeScript grammar is constantly changing. The article also provides an example of how the parsing of a type expression changed in different versions of TypeScript. It mentions that in order to continue using new TypeScript features, one may need to keep compiling to JavaScript or ensure that their Node.js version is up to date. This could be a potential issue for individuals who prefer to stick with long-term support (LTS) releases of Node.js.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of running TypeScript files directly in Node.js, which would eliminate the need for the TypeScript compiler to strip types and convert them to JavaScript. This approach is similar to how Python handles types, where type checkers check types but leave them intact for the Python interpreter to ignore. The article also mentions that while Python has multiple popular type checkers that use the same type hint syntax but have different semantics, TypeScript has become the dominant type checker for JavaScript. The author also speculates that with support for ignoring types in Node.js, JavaScript could potentially use type hints as a more convenient syntax for comments, like some developers do in Python.

## 2. [Every company should be owned by its employees](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41065227)

**Total comment counts : 106**

### Summary

 Central States Manufacturing, a company owned by its employees, is set to become a billion-dollar company this year. The company distributes stock ownership to all workers, not just executives, resulting in 47 millionaires among blue-collar employees. This approach stands in contrast to the growing wealth disparity in America, where executive pay has skyrocketed while worker pay has stagnated. Central States is part of a wider movement in the United States, with 6,533 companies forming Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), benefiting 14.7 million employees with ownership in companies worth a collective $2.1 trillion. Workers receive a percentage of their salaries in company stock each year, and the value of the stock has been outperforming the stock market. Employees can make use of the stock accounts for various purposes, such as paying for tuition or buying a home, but withdrawals are subject to taxes and fees. The company is incentivized to perform well, as employees are actively invested in its success.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges faced by businesses when trying to get started and when they struggle or fail later. It mentions that usually, the owner invests their own time and/or money to start the business. In the case of Central States, the workers were asked to buy shares from the owner, potentially using a portion of their salary. This means they are underpaid compared to market rates but have the expectation of getting more later when they sell the shares. The article raises questions about what happens when the business encounters difficulties, even if it's not their fault.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of employee stock options. It states that while offering stock options to employees can be a good business plan, not all companies choose to do so because it may not significantly impact employee incentives and it can make payment dependent on the stock market. The author argues against making it a legal requirement for all companies to offer stock options, as it would not be practical for every employee and could potentially hinder market functioning. Additionally, the article mentions the challenges faced by worker-owned cooperatives in raising capital and making decisions that prioritize worker welfare over profit.

The author is unsure about the level of involvement of humans and computers in determining the final set of solutions. They express their curiosity and seek confirmation from readers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the achievement of AI in solving problems in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). It points out that medals are awarded to only 50% of high school student participants, with a ratio of 1:2:3 between gold, silver, and bronze medals. Therefore, all gold and silver medalists are considered in the top 25% of participants. The article notes that AI solving problems better than 75% of students is impressive, but states that the time limit for each problem (minutes for one problem and up to 3 days for the remaining problems) is not representative of the actual competition. The author suggests that if students were given more time, there might be more who could match or surpass the AI's performance. The article criticizes the comparison made between the AI and the medalists, stating that it would not be fair as the AI may have only solved a single problem within the given time frame. The author suggests being more objective by reporting the percentage of problems solved or the score achieved.

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses a tool called Toybox, which combines several Linux command line utilities into a single executable. Its aim is to improve Android's command line utilities and make Android self-hosting, meaning it can build an installable Android Open Source Project image entirely from source under a stock Android system. Google merged Toybox into AOSP (Android Open Source Project) and started shipping it in Android Marshmallow. Toybox strives to provide a minimal native development environment and can be used to build Linux From Scratch and the Android Open Source Project. The article also mentions the design decisions behind Toybox, compares it to BusyBox, and explains its integration into the toybox source. The goal is to build Linux From Scratch under Toybox's result, and the current list of implemented commands can be found on the status page. Toybox follows POSIX-2008 standards and deviates from them when necessary. It draws from various sources, including Linux man pages, Linux Standard Base, and existing command implementations.

## 7. [The Puzzle of How Large-Scale Order Emerges in Complex Systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41036506)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Emergence, the phenomenon where large-scale patterns and organization arise from interactions between component parts, lacks a scientific theory to explain it. However, over the past few years, a community of physicists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists has made progress in understanding emergence. Using a mathematical formalism called computational mechanics, researchers have identified criteria for determining which systems exhibit emergence. They have tested these criteria on various model systems and found that emergent phenomena can be described as "software in the natural world" - governed by macroscale rules without considering the microscale details. This framework provides a new language for describing emergent systems and offers a step towards a better understanding of emergence.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests reading Stuart Kauffman's "The origins of order" to learn more about the interaction between chaos and order and the mechanism of evolution. The book is described as engaging but not light reading, as it presents the research of Kauffman and his PhD student. The boundary where chaos and order interact is identified as the focal point of interest.

## 9. [My Favorite Algorithm: Linear Time Median Finding (2018)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41066536)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The article discusses the problem of finding the median in a list and presents the median-of-medians algorithm as a solution. The algorithm aims to find the median of a list in deterministic linear time. The article also explains the quickselect algorithm, which is a recursive algorithm that can find any element, including the median. Quickselect operates on average in linear time. However, the article discusses the need for an algorithm that guarantees linear time performance in the worst case. The article introduces the median-of-medians algorithm as a pivot selection algorithm that provides linear time performance when used with quickselect. It explains the rationale behind the median-of-medians as a pivot and presents a visualization of the algorithm. The article provides a proof of why the median-of-medians is a good pivot and discusses the runtime complexity of the algorithm.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a method for finding the median of a large dataset using MapReduce. The author shares their experience of needing to find the median of billions of values parsed from log entries. They explain that traditional sorting methods can be time-consuming, so they developed a technique called "bucket sort." By creating a dictionary with integer millisecond timings as keys and counts of their appearance as values, the author was able to limit the size of the dictionary and find the median efficiently. This approach can be used for both integer and floating-point data. The author concludes that this method is easily implemented in a single pass, even when distributed with MapReduce.

### Top 2 Comment Summary
