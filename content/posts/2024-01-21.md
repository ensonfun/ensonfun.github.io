## 1. [Nightshade: An offensive tool for artists against AI art generators](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39058428)

**Total comment counts : 71**

### Summary

 The article discusses the development of a tool called Nightshade, which transforms images into "poison" samples to deter model trainers from using unauthorized data for training generative AI models. Unlike opt-out lists, Nightshade imposes a cost on trainers who scrape and train on unlicensed data. It distorts feature representations in AI image models, making them learn unpredictable behaviors. Nightshade works similarly to Glaze but is an offensive tool designed to disrupt models that scrape images without consent. The effects of Nightshade are robust to image alterations, and the tool does not rely on network connectivity. Its primary goal is to make a positive impact on the world and is not designed for profit. The article also mentions the coexistence of Nightshade with Glaze. However, Nightshade does not provide mimicry protection like Glaze, so caution is advised when using it alongside artwork.

It explains how objects, such as baseball bats, zombies, and buttons, collide with each other using basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines. The purpose of the book is to teach these collision principles with minimal math, providing readable examples and interactive demonstrations. The article also mentions that the book covers collisions between points, circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, and triangles, with source code available on GitHub. It advises that the examples may not work well on mobile devices and encourages readers to report any issues or suggestions for improvement. The article concludes by inviting readers to explore the table of contents and begin writing code for collision detection.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article has been using bsps, quadtrees, and grid spatial indexing data structures in game development and graphics for years. Recently, they discovered that quadtrees and bsps have a failure case when the aabb's (axis-aligned bounding boxes) within are at harmonic intervals of the space division, or very large. This results in the data being put into every single child node, even with only a few objects. This caused the author to run out of 32GB of RAM. They switched to using an rtree instead, which solved the problem.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a video about collision detection in 3D, specifically in the game Quake. The video explains how collision detection was achieved using a technique that can detect the intersection point between a moving bounding box and a hull defined as a BSP tree. While this method is considered limited compared to newer methods, it was effective and efficient for the hardware available at that time. The video provides a robust and fast implementation of this technique.

## 3. [The Bun Shell](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39071688)

**Total comment counts : 50**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of running shell scripts in JavaScript and introduces a solution called Bun Shell. It explains that the differences in syntax and commands across different shell environments make it difficult to run shell scripts in JavaScript. Currently, the solution is to rely on the community to polyfill missing commands with JavaScript implementations. However, this method is not efficient and can be expensive when running multiple commands. Bun Shell, on the other hand, is a new experimental embedded language and interpreter in Bun that allows for running cross-platform shell scripts in JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides various features such as using JavaScript variables in shell scripts, redirecting stdout to buffers or files, piping stdout to other commands, and using Response as stdin. The Bun Shell supports Windows, macOS, and Linux and is designed to be a drop-in replacement for simple shell scripts. It can be used within Bun or as a standalone shell script interpreter.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the implementation of common commands and features in a new shell. However, it raises concerns about the compatibility of this shell with existing shells and coreutils implementations. The author questions whether the new shell is POSIX-compliant or compatible with Bourne shell, and whether it supports GNU extensions. The article also suggests that using this new shell might not be suitable for replacing a Bourne-compatible shell like ZShell in most contexts. However, it acknowledges that using this shell in the JavaScript ecosystem could be useful due to its compatibility and the ability to use it in JS scripts.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Love that bun focuses on building useful things rather than listening to others' opinions about what they should or shouldn't build. They prioritize productivity over speculation.

## 4. [Common Lisp's block / return-from and unwind-protect](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39074568)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 The article discusses non-local control flow in Common Lisp. The author highlights the use of BLOCK/RETURN-FROM and UNWIND-PROTECT as elegant solutions for non-local exits in the language. They explain how BLOCK/RETURN-FROM allows for early returns from functions and breaking out of loops, while UNWIND-PROTECT functions as a try/finally block. The article emphasizes that Common Lisp provides a minimalistic and expressive system for non-local control flow.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses "block/return-from" and "catch/throw" as methods of control transfer in programming. These methods allow for transferring control from one block of code to another, either within the same scope or to an enclosing scope. If the transfer occurs through an "unwind-protect," it triggers the activation of this mechanism.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is tempted to start another project using Lisp, as they have heard that it is a powerful language for building applications. They are seeking confirmation from others with recent experience in Lisp, particularly for web development, to determine if the effort put into Lisp really leads to faster code and better applications compared to other programming languages.

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 This article discusses the concept of inequality and its framing as a social problem. It questions the idea of what it would mean to eliminate inequality and suggests that debating it allows for tinkering with numbers and policies. The article also criticizes the assumption that "the state" is a singular entity and argues for a more neutral understanding of human freedoms and forms of domination. Overall, it explores the language and frameworks used in discussions about inequality.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is confused by an article's argument that David Graeber is betraying anarchism by questioning the state and the concept of inequality. The author believes that these arguments are actually compatible with anarchism, particularly the kind that stems from anthropology. They view the author of the article as having a rigid definition of anarchism, seeing any deviation as a sign of liberal behavior or a radical shift in thought. The author acknowledges that Graeber may have hinted at a new angle in his later works, but suggests that any inconsistencies in his writing and behavior can simply be attributed to him being human rather than the ideal representative of anarchist ideology.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is praising the book "Debt" for its transformative impact on their understanding of money and macroeconomics. However, they found the book "On Kings" to be difficult to read due to its use of esoteric academic theory debates. The book "The Beginning of Everything" challenged traditional views on the emergence of states but was filled with conjecture and only concluded that things varied across different places and times. The author expresses sadness over the fact that there will not be any more books from the author being discussed.

## 10. [Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative C/C++ Garbage Collector](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39077535)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector, which can be used as a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. The collector automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be accessed. It is used by programming language implementations that use C as intermediate code or want to interoperate with C libraries. The article provides instructions on how to obtain and build the collector, and mentions that it is not completely portable but has ports for various platforms. The collector uses a mark-sweep algorithm and supports incremental and generational collection.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience using the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector (GC) for the jank Clojure dialect on LLVM with C++ interop. They explain that since jank is built primarily on persistent, immutable data structures, there are potentially many references to objects across multiple threads, leading to a lot of garbage being generated. The author initially tried using reference counting and RAII, but found that the GC was actually 2x faster in the benchmark they were optimizing. They mention that while there may be better performing GCs available, such as MMTK, the simplicity and speed of integrating the Boehm GC make it their preferred choice for their project.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The Boehm collector is praised for its ability to function in a language without runtime typing like C. It accomplishes this by making educated guesses about what is a pointer. Although pointers in C are essentially integers, they are distinct numbers, often large, and their valid set can be determined if malloc() is under control. Remarkably, this approach even applies to 32-bit architectures.
