## 1. [Shipbreaking](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40424304)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The artist Edward Burtynsky's Shipbreaking photographs capture the dismantling of massive ships, which he sees as the ultimate form of recycling. Inspired by a radio program discussing the danger of single-hulled ships, Burtynsky became fascinated by where these vessels would be taken apart. Most of the dismantling was happening in India and Bangladesh, which is where he focused his work. His images depict the aftermath of industrial progress, showing how our attempts at advancement often result in destruction. Despite this, there is a haunting beauty in the vastness and perspective of these images, suggesting that nature can eventually reclaim even the most ambitious human interventions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reminisces about their father, an electrical engineer in India, who brought home shelves and cabinets from ships being cut up at his workplace. Despite their mismatched aesthetics, the author's father was excited about salvaging functional pieces. The most intriguing cabinet had a white paint with green stencil printing, possibly Cyrillic script. The cabinets are still in the author's old house, and they plan to translate the text on their next visit to discover the original intention and what their mother is storing in it.

 The article discusses the practice of western shipping companies sending larger vessels to countries like India and Bangladesh for cheaper repair work. However, this practice raises concerns related to the environment and the safety of human workers. The article also highlights instances where these attempts have failed, resulting in accidents such as oil spills when the vessels drift to land.

## 2. [How terminal works. Part 1: Xterm, user input (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40419325)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 This article is part of a blog series that explains how modern terminals and command-line tools work, with a focus on learning through experimentation. The author provides Linux tools to debug the discussed components and encourages readers to explore further through additional resources. The target audience is those who want to start working with command-line tools. The series consists of four parts, with the first two discussing how xterm works and the other two focusing on different features of tty. The article starts by explaining an inaccurate diagram that shows the general use case of working with a command-line shell. It then delves into the communication process between the user, xterm (terminal emulator), and bash (command shell). The article acknowledges that this model is simplistic and that in reality, the communication scheme is more complicated due to additional features implemented over time. The existence of a middleman called tty is mentioned, which will be discussed in later parts. The article continues by explaining the conversion of keyboard scancodes into GUI events and the steps involved in this process. It also mentions using strace as a practical approach to observe what a terminal writes and reads into/from filehandles while a process is running. The author provides an example of using strace to observe keypress events in xterm. The article concludes by mentioning that upcoming discussions will cover topics such as ANSI escape sequences and ASCII control characters.

 The article is not available directly in the provided link, but the other three parts can be found by going up a level on the website.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author used to search for code in the getty.c program that allowed all capital letters for logins due to older models of teletypes and VDU terminals without a shift function. This made the author question how the password check and the strength of the crypt function would work if the case wasn't important. These code lines were removed from FreeBSD during the 2.x series.

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the different approaches to learning, specifically the conflict between implicit learning (discovery learning) and guided learning (cognitive psychology). Implicit learning prioritizes meaning and emotion, while guided learning focuses on cognition and instruction. The author suggests that a synthesis of both approaches is needed, where authentic projects are infused with guided support when necessary. The goal is to create a learning environment where one can dive into projects while still ensuring effective learning.

## 8. [What UI density means and how to design for it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40428386)

**Total comment counts : 47**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of UI density in interfaces and compares the denseness of websites and applications in 2024 to their counterparts from the 2000s. It explains that density is not just about the visual appearance of an interface but also about the amount of information it provides over a series of moments. Visual density is the number of elements seen in a given space, where a visually dense interface has a lot of content on the screen. The author provides examples of visually dense websites like Bloomberg's Terminal and Craigslist. However, visual density can be subjective and biased, so the article suggests aiming for a consistent and meaningful definition of density. The concept of information density is introduced, which measures the useful parts of a visualization in relation to the total ink used to print it. The goal is to have a high ratio of data-ink to total ink. Information density and visual density are often correlated, with higher information density resulting in a more visually dense visualization. The article includes examples such as a train schedule from 1885 to illustrate this concept.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that physical restaurant menus are superior to mobile site menus. The author mentions that while viewing a restaurant's menu on a phone, they always prefer to look for a picture of the menu on Google Maps because it is easier to navigate. They explain that mobile-friendly menu sites typically only show a few items at a time, which requires constant scrolling to see everything.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of visual salience and how it relates to information density in user interfaces. It argues that a good interface should maximize information without sacrificing visual salience. This can be achieved by using clear boundaries between information sets and encapsulating information in something visually distinct, such as whitespace. It references a paper by Kadir and Brady for further explanation on the relationship between saliency, scale, and image description.

## 9. [Formatted spreadsheets can still work in R](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40385562)

It also mentions using tidyxl to unravel formatting issues and suggests following good practices for organizing data in spreadsheets to avoid problems. The article concludes by thanking Jeremy Selva for the idea and providing further reading suggestions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the importance of data quality by using the analogy of water quality. The author argues that if you come across one piece of bad data, you cannot simply ignore it and proceed with the rest. Instead, you need to address the issue and investigate the source of the bad data. The article also questions the reliability of data that starts with a "cursed date" such as 32/1/2017.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of color to indicate units of measurement in data. Instead of creating a new column, the author suggests using different text colors, such as black for pounds and green for kilograms. This approach is seen as a unique and effective way of marking data.
