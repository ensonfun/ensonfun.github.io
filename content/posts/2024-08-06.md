## 1. [I don't know how CPUs work so I simulated one in code (2019)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41129081)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The author recounts their journey of learning about computers by reading the book "But How Do It Know?" by J. Clark Scott, which explains the components of a simple 8-bit computer. Inspired by this, the author decides to implement their own version of the computer in code. They describe their project, called "simple-computer," which simulates the workings of the computer, including CPU code, keyboard inputs, and text rendering. The author acknowledges that their understanding of computers is limited and they want to delve deeper into topics such as CPU caches, pipelining, and vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre. They believe that building a foundation of knowledge is necessary for this, which is why they chose to start with a simple computer model described in the book. They recommend reading the book for a good overview of computer concepts and mention that they upgraded their computer to 16-bit to have more memory.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of understanding that signals in a project are not instantaneous and run in parallel, which cannot be adequately captured by thinking of gates as simple on-off switches. As the article explains, the different and unstable signals sent by the NOT gate as the chain of AND gates switch may lead to ambiguous interpretations of 1 or 0 in downstream gates. This is why computers have clocks, to ensure that all transistors in a stage of a CPU reach a steady state before moving on to the next instruction. The article concludes by suggesting that it is advisable to work with a Hardware Description Language (HDL) instead of attempting to wing it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article shares their experience with building a simple 8-bit CPU using logic gates and creating a JavaScript emulator for it. They mention that while their own project only took a weekend to complete, they understand why another person's project took 4 months. The other project used gate-level simulated logic gates, which is a more complex and impressive approach compared to emulating whole components. The author also provides a link to the emulator they created.

## 3. [The Soul of Maintaining a New Machine](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41167615)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the experiences of technician teams responsible for maintaining Xerox machines in the mid-1980s. These machines were complex and required frequent conversations between technicians to keep them functioning properly. The article highlights the discrepancy between what the technicians actually did and what the Xerox corporation believed they did, leading to unnecessary difficulties. An anthropologist named Julian Orr discovered this and conducted research on the technicians, which culminated in his book "Talking About Machines: An Ethnography of a Modern Job." The book reveals that the technicians solved the most challenging problems through discussions and "war stories"â€”narratives about how they solved complex machine issues. The article also mentions that some problems were caused by user error, and the technicians considered this fixable. Additionally, the article describes the complexity and capabilities of the Xerox 9400 machine, which was introduced in 1977. The technicians were organized into regional teams and had little interest in advancing within the Xerox corporation, as they found fulfillment in their work with customers and machines.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on their previous dismissal of important work by Orr and Suchman, which focused on improving copier machines by considering the sociology of repair workers. The author acknowledges that their techno-determinist perspective hindered their understanding of user problems and the broader social impact of their own work. They mention how failure to appreciate the social scope can limit the success of companies and products. The author cites examples of the crypto community and Google as instances where a focus on technology and internal culture, respectively, led to limitations in their impact. The author admits to still holding on to some of their previous views, as evident in their attitude towards complaints about git.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) paid for itself through various ways. Firstly, by conducting anthropological and sociological studies on copier repair technicians, PARC identified shortcomings in copier engineering and made changes to improve newer designs, resulting in reduced maintenance costs. Secondly, by enabling information sharing and documentation among repair technicians, the company saved 5-8% of service costs, despite resistance from services management. Lastly, the article argues that Xerox management failed to understand the value created by copier repair technicians and overlooked potential monetary gains. Despite the success of PARC, the focus often remains on missed opportunities.

## 5. [Building rqlite 9.0: Cutting disk usage by half](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41167060)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses the upcoming release of rqlite 9.0, a lightweight, distributed relational database written in Go. The main goal of this release is to reduce disk usage by approximately 50%. Currently, rqlite's disk space usage is driven by the need to store a snapshotted copy of the working SQLite database in the Raft system, which causes both the working database and the snapshot copy to grow in size. The proposed 9.0 design introduces a new approach called Referential Snapshotting, where the working SQLite database file and the snapshotted copy are logically the same, eliminating the need for a separate snapshot copy in the Raft system. This design is expected to improve disk usage, snapshotting speed, and node restart times. The author also mentions other details that need to be considered for this release, such as SQLite WAL management and seamless upgrades from earlier versions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is interested in how rqlite's performance compares to other distributed databases developed in Go, including CockroachDB, Vitess, and TiDB.

## 6. [Parody site ClownStrike refused to bow to CrowdStrike's bogus DMCA takedown](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41173486)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 IT consultant David Senk created a parody site called ClownStrike in response to a large IT outage that CrowdStrike blamed on a faulty security update. Senk used an altered version of CrowdStrike's logo on the site to mock the company. However, CrowdStrike issued a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice, requesting the removal of their logo from the parody site. Senk argued that his use of the logo falls under fair use as it is clearly a parody. After Cloudflare, the hosting provider, failed to respond to Senk's counter notice, he moved the site to a server in Finland. CrowdStrike stated that the takedown notice was likely sent as part of their efforts to stop bad actors from using their logo on malicious sites, but they will review the process.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a situation involving Cloudflare, a web services company, and a user named Senk. Senk had received a notice from Cloudflare regarding alleged infringement of the CrowdStrike logos on his site. Senk believed that his use of the logos was fair use as his site was a parody. He contested the notice and sent a counter notice to Cloudflare, but did not receive any response from them. This lack of response from Cloudflare made Senk concerned about whether he wanted to continue using their services. The author urges Cloudflare to be a neutral arbiter and not contribute to the issues surrounding the DMCA system, which has a tendency to favor large parties over smaller ones.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article had set up a website 20 years ago on the domain https://whatisbifidusregularis.org/. They were threatened with a lawsuit by Dannon (also known as Danone) and had to give up the domain because it was a trademark. However, before doing so, the author set up a 301 redirect and allowed Google to adjust to the change. This incident occurred in a time when corporations did not have as much knowledge about contacting ISPs and getting content banned without involving lawyers. The author had an email correspondence with a lawyer from Danone. The author later set up a new site called bifidusdigestivum.com to address the advertisements of Dannon/Danone's "Bifidus Digesivum" bacteria, which they found ridiculous. The new site has received around 1.5 million views and still gets 400-500 monthly visits.

## 7. [Writing a tile server in Python](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41168033)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses the development of a tileset based on OpenStreetMap data and elevation information. The author modified a script called "generate_tiles" to handle rendering processes, allowing for the rendering of specific regions or individual tiles. The script includes optimizations such as not rendering unnecessary child tiles and reusing cached data to accelerate rendering. The author prefers their own tile server over renderd because it allows for individual tile storage and easier conversion to other formats. The rendering engine consists of a main thread and rendering threads, which load the style and wait for work. The system uses queues and a caching optimization to manage rendering tasks and ensure that a metatile's children are rendered before moving to another region.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is looking for a cross-platform library that can convert vector MBTiles (MapBox Tilesets) into fully rendered raster tiles using a given stylesheet. They want to use the same mapping engine on multiple platforms, such as Skia for rendering. Raster tiles become large after level 12, so using a vector format would allow for more control over which features to include and reduce the overall size of the data.

### Summary

 The server could not find the requested resource due to an error generated by Mod_Security.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a drum brake design that uses a camming system to increase braking force as speed increases. This design does not require a brake booster as part of the hydraulics. The author questions why this camming innovation was not transferred to the more conventional drum brakes of the time. They point out a potential flaw in the design, where the two halves of the drum are held together by machine screws/bolts, which could impact braking force if not properly fastened or if they loosen over time. The author suggests that this design may be less resistant to poor maintenance practices compared to conventional drum or disk brakes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In the article, it is highlighted that America's automotive golden age started with a lot of innovation, including features like methanol injection and turbos before Saab. However, Europe's cars were not suitable for the American market, giving Detroit very little competition. Detroit also did not face resource constraints and once consumer preferences were established, they became complacent. In contrast, Europe and Japan had to work hard to produce good cars due to their economic situation and were culturally open to each other. Ultimately, Detroit's decline began in the 1990s.
