## 2. [Over the edge: The use of design tactics to undermine browser choice](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39237567)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 Mozilla commissioned independent researchers to investigate Microsoft's tactics in preventing effective browser choice on Windows. The researchers found that Microsoft places its own browser, Edge, at the center of the operating system and uses harmful design tactics to undermine rival browsers. This behavior is detrimental to competition and can harm consumers. Mozilla has highlighted the issue of self-preferencing by operating system/browser providers in the past. While there have been some improvements, they are incomplete and limited to certain markets. Regulatory action is needed to restore browser choice and competition across all major platforms.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article mentions trying out the Edge browser to test its "efficiency mode" in terms of battery life on their laptop. However, they found it difficult to use Edge as a privacy-respecting browser that allows users to choose their search engine. The default settings include options like "Microsoft Rewards" and "creator recommendations" which the author had to manually change. The selection for a default search engine is buried in the settings, and even after changing it, new tabs still open with an unchangeable page that uses Microsoft's search engine. Additionally, Edge sends searches to Microsoft unless another default option is turned off. The author also mentions that after updates, Microsoft prompts users to return their default search engine to Bing. Overall, the author finds these factors to be egregious.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of deep learning models for time-series forecasting. It highlights the benefits of improving forecasting accuracy, especially in the retail industry. The article introduces TimesFM, a single forecasting model that is pre-trained on a large time-series corpus. TimesFM performs well on unseen datasets and has a much smaller size compared to other language models. The article explains the structure and training process of TimesFM, highlighting the use of stacked transformer layers and a multilayer perceptron block. It also discusses the capability of the model to predict a longer length of subsequent time-points than the input patch length. The article concludes by mentioning plans to make the model available for external customers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The research in the field of time series analysis is conflicting, with different methods claiming to be the most effective. The ETS model, a weighted moving average, performs better than recent deep learning models according to a graph. However, the papers for those deep learning models argue that they outperform ETS and other basic methods by a significant margin. Some researchers support new transformer models as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for time series analysis, while others claim that transformers are not suitable and propose their own MLP variant as SOTA. Some papers argue that deep learning underperforms compared to xgboost/lightgbm models. Overall, the diverse nature of time series data makes it difficult to determine a universal foundation model for analysis. Transfer learning, which works well in language models, is flawed in time series analysis because most time series data is noisy and lacks sufficient context to transfer information between different time series.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the progress in tabular deep learning and explains that tree-based algorithms like Catboost and XGBoost have been the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in this area. The article suggests that a new development is seen as a significant move towards achieving a deep learning model that is more generalizable, rather than relying on tree models.

## 8. [Fiber Optics Bring You Internet. Now They're Also Listening to Trains](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39214047)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Scientists are using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology to monitor various activities and phenomena by analyzing vibrations in fiber optic cables. DAS has been used to monitor cicada emergences, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. Now, researchers are experimenting with using DAS to monitor railroads. When a train runs along a section of track, it creates vibrations that can be monitored using DAS. Any sudden changes in the signal could indicate a problem with the rail, such as a crack or a snapped tie. DAS can also detect gradual changes that may indicate faults in track alignment. Fiber optic cables already run along many railways for signaling equipment or telecommunications, making it convenient to tap into the existing infrastructure to implement DAS. An interrogator device is used to send laser pulses down the cables and analyze the light reflections to measure the distance to a disturbance near the track. By comparing the DAS data over time, any deviations can be identified and addressed before they become a problem. DAS technology has the potential to reduce the human labor required for inspecting railroad tracks, and it can even detect unauthorized activities, such as people walking along the tracks or digging for copper. The challenge with DAS is the massive amount of data it generates, so machine learning is used for automation and analysis.
