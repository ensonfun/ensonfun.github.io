## 1. [Asteroid crater 520km in diameter buried in southeast Australia, scientists say](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37159680)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 Scientists have discovered what they believe to be the largest known impact structure in the world, buried deep in the earth in southern New South Wales, Australia. Named the Deniliquin structure, it spans up to 520 kilometers in diameter, surpassing the size of the previously considered largest impact structure, the Vredefort impact structure in South Africa. Erosion, sediment burial, and subduction have made it difficult to identify impact structures, but geophysical discoveries are uncovering signatures of large impact structures formed by asteroids. The Deniliquin structure exhibits features expected of a large impact structure, such as magnetic readings revealing a symmetrical rippling pattern and radial faults. Further evidence of impact will require drilling deep into the structure. The researchers suspect that the impact occurred during the Late Ordovician mass extinction event and may have triggered the Hirnantian glaciation stage, which eliminated about 85% of species on Earth.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the number of impact structures in Australia that are larger than 100km, suggesting that there may have been numerous mass extinction events in the past that are unknown due to the incomplete fossil record. It also provides links to additional resources on extinction events, the Chicxulub crater, and the natural history of the Earth.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 3. [How to Produce Green Hydrogen for $1/Kg](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37155241)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 This article discusses Terraform Industries' approach to developing a scalable electrolyzer for producing cheap green hydrogen. The company aims to make green hydrogen competitive in terms of cost and believes that rapid mass market adoption depends on beating incumbent polluters on price. The article explores the cost factors involved in green hydrogen production, including embodied energy and the cost of the hydrogen electrolyzer. It also discusses the potential use of solar power to drive electrolysis and highlights the importance of low capex and flexibility in consuming intermittent renewable electricity sources. The article concludes by noting the potential future impact of cheap green hydrogen on the global energy economy, particularly in the aviation and manufacturing sectors.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the plan to use hydrogen in combination with carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the air to produce methane. The author emphasizes that the main challenge is reducing the cost of carbon capture, rather than obtaining hydrogen. According to calculations, approximately 13.6 kilograms of carbon and 4.54 kilograms of hydrogen are needed to produce enough natural gas for 1 gigajoule (GJ) of heat when combusted. Around 27% of the captured CO2 is carbon. Based on current prices for direct air capture of CO2 at $1000 per tonne, the cost of capturing enough CO2 to produce 1 GJ of natural gas is estimated to be about $50. Assuming a significant improvement in air capture costs to $100 per tonne, the cost of CO2 capture would be around $5. When combined with the cost of hydrogen, which is approximately $4.50, the total input cost would be around $9.50. While this is higher than the current cost of domestic natural gas in the US, it could be subsidized on a larger scale. Additionally, the cost seems reasonable in comparison to imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Europe and Asia. Therefore, the author suggests that reducing direct air capture costs is crucial for the business plan of producing methane.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 4. [Intel QuickAssist Technology Zstandard Plugin for Zstandard](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37154939)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses the addition of a new feature to the Zstandard (zstd) compression algorithm called the Intel® QuickAssist Technology (Intel® QAT) sequence producer. This feature allows for the integration of Intel QAT, which can significantly improve the throughput, latency, and power efficiency of zstd compression. The sequence producer interface enables the use of Intel QAT for searching and matching byte strings, resulting in faster compression and reduced latency. The article provides performance data comparing Intel QAT-Zstd Plugin with traditional software-based compression, highlighting the improvements in throughput, latency, and power consumption. The QAT-ZSTD Plugin is expected to further enhance compression ratios and performance in future iterations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article highlights the recent achievement of Intel in reducing power and CPU load in Zstandard, a major software task. It acknowledges that AMD has been making significant advancements in the enterprise space with advantages in RAM, PCIE, and core count. However, the article emphasizes the importance of software that properly utilizes hardware features. The author appreciates the competition between AMD and Intel, as it leads to innovation and benefits for consumers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's appreciation for the QAT (QuickAssist Technology) libraries, which they feel are often overlooked. They also mention Intel's igzip library, which is faster than zlib and does not require QAT. However, the article highlights the difficulty of using this technology in practice, particularly in the cloud where finding a bare metal instance with the QAT peripheral can be challenging. Additionally, the author mentions that this generation of hardware is only just starting to become available in public clouds. For individuals who own their own machines, they would need to carefully examine Intel's product matrix in order to find a Xeon processor with QAT capability.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses whether technology, which involves the manipulation of non-biological environments, is compatible with the long-term survival of biological life. It suggests that while all life manipulates its surroundings to some extent, the advancement of technology in the Anthropocene era represents a significant qualitative step. The article acknowledges the lack of data on this topic but raises concerns that based on human behavior, the chances of technologically enhanced life self-destructing in the near future are not impossible. It also speculates that if intelligent biology is inherently unstable and unable to self-regulate due to primal drives, the absence of technological signals would be evident.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The Drake equation suggests that the key factor determining the existence of civilizations in other star systems is the overlap of time between our civilization and theirs. Given the vast timescale of the universe compared to the relatively short time our civilization has existed, it is highly probable that other civilizations either preceded or will follow us. The chances of experiencing simultaneous existence with nearby civilizations are highly unlikely, even with a significant multiplier.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article tells a story about a safety system in fighter jets that disables weapons systems if a weight load is detected on the landing gear, to prevent accidental explosions. During the Eurofighter Typhoon's first live weapons test, the weapons failed to launch because a function that checks the landing gear before launching the weapons had not been implemented properly. The lack of a unit test for this function allowed the problem to go unnoticed before launch, resulting in costly redeployment to fix the issue. This safety system ensures that scenes like the ones depicted in movies where a pilot accidentally blows up their own airbase while on the ground cannot happen in real life.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The user is frustrated that the article does not explain the connection between the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and the information provided.
