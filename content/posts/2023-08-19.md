**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 This article discusses the structure of the Roman Republic during the third and second centuries, specifically focusing on the offices of praetor and consul and their powers called imperium. These offices are the highest in the Roman government and wield direct military and judicial authority. Competition for these positions is fierce among the Roman elite, but winners and losers are chosen by the popular assemblies. Imperium is the power to command and includes the ability to deploy violence for the community. Magistrates with imperium are represented by lictors who carry a bundle of sticks, symbolizing their civil power. The power of imperium cannot be separated into its component elements. Praetors are junior magistrates with imperium and are responsible for organizing courts and leading armies. Consuls are the most powerful magistrates and lead Rome's main field armies. They also propose major legislation. The Senate assigns provinces and directs the allocation of resources to the consuls.

## 6. [Why do old books smell so good?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37188015)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 Scientists are using volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by old books to determine their age, condition, and history. VOCs are released as paper and other organic compounds in books break down over time due to factors like light, heat, and moisture. Different compounds in the paper, inks, and bindings contribute to the distinct smell of old books. VOC analysis can reveal the manufacturing process, exposure to smoke or water damage, and preservation needs of old books. This analysis can also help match orphaned books with their original libraries based on their chemical fingerprints. The study of VOCs from books provides insights into their origins and their journey through time.

 The article discusses the concept of economic complexity, which refers to the diversity and sophistication of a country's productive capabilities as reflected in its exports. High complexity countries possess a wide range of specialized capabilities, allowing them to produce a diverse set of complex products. The number of capabilities a country has is determined not only by the absolute number of products it makes, but also by the ubiquity of those products (i.e., the number of countries exporting them) and the diversity and sophistication of products made by other countries. More information on the topic can be found in the glossary provided in the article.

## 10. [Stable Diffusion in C/C++](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37187663)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses the topic of stable diffusion in pure C/C++. It mentions using Git or SVN for version control and provides information about using the official CLI. The article also mentions the option to use Codespaces and troubleshoots any issues that may arise during the preparation of the codespace. It talks about the inference of stable diffusion and provides instructions on downloading original weights in different formats. The article emphasizes that using formats of different precisions will yield varying results in terms of quality.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two different approaches to machine learning (ML) called Llama.cpp/ggml and Stable Diffusion (SD). Llama.cpp/ggml is well-suited for llamas because of its large memory requirements, effective quantization, and serial token generation, making it ideal for CPUs. It is even better suited for ggml's unique pipelined CPU/GPU inference. On the other hand, Stable Diffusion does not quantize as well, but it is very compute intensive. It benefits from batched image generation and the hackability of Python implementations, making it a better fit for GPUs/IGPs. The author suggests that ML compilation to executables is the way forward for SD, with AITemplate already being fast and promising, and TVM Vulkan showing potential as well. Both approaches' implementations are available on GitHub (linked in the article).

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article shares their experience setting up a program on Linux using the command `cmake .. -DGGML_OPENBLAS=ON`. They ran the program on an AMD Ryzen 7 5700g with integrated graphics. The program loaded a model and performed sampling steps, with each step taking around 12 seconds. The total sampling process took 246.40 seconds. The author is unsure if this performance is expected because they did not have Open Blas installed.
