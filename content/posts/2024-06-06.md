## 2. [TPM GPIO fail: How bad OEM firmware ruins Intel TPM security](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40593540)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses a software attack that can manipulate the PCRs of a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) device, allowing an attacker to unseal any secret that uses a PCR-based sealing policy. The attack involves resetting the TPM device without physical manipulation by reassigning the reset pin to the GPIO block and driving its value low from software. This attack can be used to target TPM FDE (Full Disk Encryption) schemes like BitLocker. The article mentions that Intel platforms have a mechanism to lock the configuration of PCH (Platform Controller Hub) pins, but it is unclear if it is implemented correctly in devices. Mitigating this attack would require firmware updates to affected devices. The article also discusses how BootGuard, a feature provided by Intel platforms, can be bypassed when used in conjunction with a TPM device. The article concludes by stating that Intel does not consider this attack variant a vulnerability in BootGuard and suggests that a pre-boot firmware platform component like Intel CSME could set the lock bit as a mitigation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the vulnerability of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) when an attacker has physical access to a system. The article mentions that there have been known attacks on the TPM since 2018 and that some motherboards have the TPM on a removable module, making it easier for attackers to intercept communications without desoldering the chip. It also mentions that recent Intel and AMD CPUs have firmware TPMs that run in the CPU's trusted execution environment, making it harder to intercept communications through I2C. However, physical access to the machine still poses a risk as attackers can install keyloggers. The article includes a link to further information on the topic.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes TPM (Trusted Platform Module) as being useless for protecting a certificate and private key in a Java application. It states that there is no satisfactory Java API available to utilize a TPM 2 chip, thereby rendering its use ineffective. As a result, the only remaining option for protection is to rely on a hardcoded passphrase within the application, which is vulnerable to being easily deciphered.

## 3. [Most life on Earth is dormant, after pulling an 'emergency brake'](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40592575)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 Researchers have discovered a protein called Balon that can stop a cell's production of new proteins. Balon was found in bacteria that hibernate in Arctic permafrost, but it is also produced by many other organisms and may be a mechanism for dormancy throughout the tree of life. Dormancy is a vital survival strategy for many organisms when faced with harsh conditions. The protein shuts down the ribosome, which is responsible for building new proteins, saving energy for basic survival needs. Balon is unique because it actively interrupts active ribosomes in the middle of their work, unlike other known ribosome-disrupting hibernation factors. This discovery could provide insights into how dormancy works and potentially help engineer organisms that can tolerate warmer climates and withstand climate change.
