**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article discusses the claim made by a retired Olympic ski tuner that ski tuning is a scam and that keeping skis dry is all that is needed to maintain sharpness. The author, however, disagrees with this claim and provides evidence of abrasion damage on ski edges. They explain that ski edges can become rounded and have small metal chunks ripped out, affecting the performance of the skis. The author describes their own method of fixing this damage using a 3D printed jig and a diamond stone. They emphasize the importance of sharp skis for a better experience on icy slopes. The article concludes by stating that the author's opinions are their own and not representative of their employer.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of sharp edges and proper bevels on ski equipment, particularly for racing. It emphasizes that having sharp edges and the correct bevels is crucial when skiing on hard or water-injected snow. The author agrees with the comments made by experienced individuals and suggests that once the edge angles are set, using a diamond stone should be sufficient to restore the edge shape after use, without the need for filing. However, if the edges are damaged with rocks or rust, additional measures may be required. The article also mentions that the practicality of maintaining ski edges with a diamond stone depends on factors such as owning personal equipment, being a skilled skier who benefits from tuned edges, and having the technical ability to use a diamond stone effectively. Overall, the author appreciates the discussion on skiing maintenance presented in the article.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of tuning ski edges based on the type of skier and skis being used. For ski racers and those riding groomers aggressively, tuning edges is important. However, for skiers who ride big powder skis or primarily ski in the park, the state of the edges matters less. For beginner or intermediate skiers, having blunter edges can actually help by making slide turns easier and requiring less force. The author mentions personal experience of using skis that haven't been sharpened in years but still perform well.

## 8. [Tiny robots with a big impact: microrobots for single-cell handling](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40880551)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Scientists have developed a family of laser-operated microrobots that can manipulate single cells. These nanoscale robots work in conjunction with optical tweezers, which are laser beams used to trap microscopic objects. The microrobots are thin and flexible enough to grip cells without damaging them. They can be used to transfer cells, rotate cells for imaging, and press cells together to study their reactions. The researchers used a process called two-photon polymerization to create the microrobots, which involves using light to harden a polymer at specific spots. The microrobots provide a non-destructive way to manipulate and image single cells in their natural environment. While these tools are still specialized, laboratories equipped with the necessary technology can modify and optimize them for different tasks.

## 10. [How the continuum hypothesis could have been a fundamental axiom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40866883)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 The article discusses how the continuum hypothesis could be seen as a fundamental axiom in mathematics. It explores the idea that the hypothesis is necessary for mathematics, particularly in calculus. The author argues that alternative foundational schemes do not offer anything new in the arithmetical realm, except potentially for Grothendieck universes. However, taking the existence of a countably additive real valued measure as fundamental has concrete consequences for measurables and descriptive set theory questions. The article also considers the possibility of adopting axioms inconsistent with ZFC and concludes that no alternative historical development would contradict ZF about arithmetical statements. The author supports the idea that the continuum hypothesis should be taken as the most fundamental axiom in mathematics but acknowledges that its historical development through countable numbers has led to the present view. The article touches on the difference between mathematics and physics, with the author suggesting that the "quantum hypothesis" is the most fundamental axiom in theoretical physics.
