## 1. [S3 is files, but not a filesystem](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39656657)

**Total comment counts : 43**

### Summary

 The article discusses the differences between Amazon S3, a cloud filesystem, and the Unix file API. It explains that while S3 is often referred to as a filesystem, it is not a true filesystem and cannot replace one. The Unix file API is described as a "deep" module that handles a wide range of concerns with just five basic functions. In contrast, shallow modules have a larger API surface and may use YAML as an interface. The article highlights that S3's API is simpler than the Unix file API but lacks the ability to overwrite partially, limiting its use for certain database applications. The combination of Amazon S3 and SQLite or DuckDB, while initially appealing, is not practical due to the limitations of S3's overwrite functionality.

 The article claims that the durability of Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is industry-leading and superior to traditional file systems. The author highlights that the physical infrastructure and safety culture of S3 contribute to its reliability. In comparison to other cloud providers, AWS's availability zone isolation is better, as it separates data to a greater extent. The author emphasizes the organization's strong focus on data integrity and resilience, including measures like data checksums and precautions against natural disasters. The author concludes by stating their trust in S3 for storing critical data based on their experience as the writer of the S3 placement system.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses the slow performance of listing files in Amazon S3 compared to the fast read and write speeds of the service. They mention that when working on a script to manage assets in S3, they found that recursively listing files took around fifteen minutes for their specific setup. The author tried various suggestions but couldn't find a significant improvement in the speed. They question why Amazon has not addressed this issue and suggest that implementing B-trees on the individual buckets could be a potential solution. The author expresses curiosity about any possible challenges that could be causing the slow performance.

Additionally, it provides instructions for installing and using pipexec.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article explains how to create extra file descriptor pipes using a bash-native method. The script uses the `mkfifo` command to create a pipe and then associates a file descriptor (in this case, 3) with the pipe using the `exec` command. After obtaining the file descriptor, the script immediately removes the filesystem path to the pipe. This ensures that the only reference to the pipe is from the script itself, and when the script ends, the kernel will automatically free the pipe. The article provides an example use case for this method.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses dgsh, the directed graph shell, which is a software tool that uses Unix domain sockets instead of pipes. Using domain sockets helps to avoid deadlocks compared to using pipes. The article also provides links to more information and examples of dgsh.

## 7. [Using LLMs to Generate Fuzzers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39653312)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating fuzzers for input formats. The author references an experiment in which the LLM named Claude successfully generated a fuzzer for GIF parsing code, finding vulnerabilities in the process. The author initially found this surprising because LLMs are not typically considered great at precise reasoning about code. However, the author suggests that LLMs may be well-suited for fuzzing, as fuzzing is a stochastic process that requires generating inputs that are close enough to what is expected by the program. The author also tests Claude on an unknown input format and finds success. Overall, LLMs show promise in automating the process of creating fuzzers for complex input formats.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Claude, a GIF fuzzer program, was able to generate working Python code based on its training on fuzzer source code and knowledge of GIF parsers. The author points out that although some people may question the intelligence behind such a program, the ability to bring together and translate various concepts into actual code is remarkable. The author then shares a personal experience of using Claude to draft an email for them, saving them time and effort in understanding and summarizing dense material. The author concludes by emphasizing that, despite the program's abilities, the magic of its capabilities has not been lost.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses frustration with people testing language learning models (LLMs) and drawing conclusions based on the output from just one attempt. The author emphasizes that the output generated by the model is influenced by a random seed, so different attempts will yield different results. They argue that it is not sufficient to draw conclusions from just one answer and suggest that retrying the prompt could lead to better or worse code generation.
