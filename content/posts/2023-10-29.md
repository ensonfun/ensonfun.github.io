## 4. [Running Speeds](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38056227)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of running speed and how it is distributed among individuals. It starts by describing a promotion in which customers were invited to try and steal a product from a shoe store, with a professional sprinter acting as the security guard. The article then compares the speed of the sprinter to that of an average runner and highlights the significant difference in their abilities. It goes on to discuss the speed of a mascot called the Freeze, who races against fans during breaks in baseball games. Despite giving the fans a head start, the Freeze consistently overtakes and wins the race. The article explains that while the Freeze is a good runner, he is not a professional athlete. It then dives into the distribution of running speed, explaining that it follows a lognormal distribution rather than a Gaussian distribution. The author theorizes that the speed of a runner depends on the product of various factors rather than their sum, with the weakest factor having the most significant impact. The article uses a simulation to demonstrate how this mechanism can produce a lognormal distribution of running speeds. It concludes by suggesting that because the distribution of running speed is lognormal, there will always be someone faster than you.

The article also mentions that AMD cards are more friendly towards customers, and modified Radeon cards can be found for around $100. However, these cards lack CUDA support, which may limit their usefulness.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the creation of the 170HX by NVidia to address two problems. Firstly, a small group of users were buying graphics cards in bulk, preventing long-term users from obtaining them. Secondly, these cards were being dumped back into the market after a few years, causing fluctuations in the market. The purpose of the 170HX was to address these issues. If the cryptocurrency mining boom hadn't occurred, NVidia would have faced a saturated market and a decline in stock price. Therefore, although users may not be able to use the 170HX, it served its intended purpose.
