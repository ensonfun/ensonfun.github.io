## 1. [Do the simplest thing that could possibly work](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45068091)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article argues for 'do the simplest thing that could possibly work' in software design, not chasing an ideal, highly-factorable system. Begin by deeply understanding the existing system, then implement the simplest solution that meets current requirements. As developers gain tool familiarity, avoid unnecessary infrastructure; leverage Unix primitives and existing components (e.g., edge proxies, caches) before building new pieces. Use YAGNI: add features only when needed. It presents rate-limiting as an example and warns about three pitfalls: inflexibility, ambiguous notion of 'simplest,' and neglecting future scalability. Hacks aren’t truly simple; true simplicity is deliberate, scalable design.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece argues that simplicity is deceptive in large-scale systems. In big tech, even basic problems become complex, requiring long timelines and constantly breaking due to edge cases and scale. Rewrites often fail because there are too many considerations to address. It echoes Chesterton's Fence: you shouldn’t remove established safeguards or rules without understanding their purpose, or you may destroy something valuable you don’t yet grasp.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author warns against broad, blanket claims about the “right” way to do software development, calling such proclamations red flags. Experience shows software development is hard and context-dependent, with no one-size-fits-all solution. The ideal is open-minded, thoughtful practitioners who consider nuance.

 With only the line “That page is causing havoc in my browser,” there isn’t enough content to summarize an article. A concise interpretation: a webpage is disrupting browser performance or stability, possibly due to heavy scripts or incompatibilities. If you provide the full article, I’ll summarize it in under 100 words.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Author has built low-level software and OS components and argues the main reason not to write your own OS today is vendor documentation. In the past, vendors provided detailed specs that let you implement your own drivers. Now you typically get only mid-level descriptions and often questionable Linux drivers. While laziness plays a role, the core issue is complexity: modern hardware is so intricate that full documentation and driver development would take exceedingly long.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 From the author’s experience at Oculus after its acquisition, XROS was a nuisance and distraction for core tech teams, with many problematic tech stacks needing fixes first. The XROS initiative appeared after Oculus was reorganized into Facebook proper, suggesting some FB teams or individuals wanted to join the AR/VR push. Carmack’s influence waned after the reorg, which the author views as worsening the situation.

## 5. [Lisp from Nothing, Second Edition](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45037419)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 This Lulu Press 2025 release presents a book on minimal LISP, offering multiple implementations from a metacircular evaluator to a self-contained C compiler. Framed by reflections on early LISP hacking, the second edition adds Lisp–Lambda Calculus coverage, introduces quasiquotation for macros, and patches typos for smoother prose. The package includes free code, PDFs, errata, and downloadables: Lisp and Scheme sources, a punch-card PostScript generator, and title-page artwork. Note: hardcover edition from Nothing isn’t available in retail shops.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 A reader, who has engaged with a couple of the author's books and spent nearly a decade studying compilers, expresses genuine curiosity about the author personally. They regard the works as cultural artifacts—deeply personal, like poetry—created for the process rather than practicality, novelty, or research value. They conclude it's a personal journey and ask the author to share their vision and motivation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Summary: The article reviews a Church-encoded list in church.scm, defined by kons, kar, kdr, nil, null, and atom. Each element uses two extra booleans; the atom check is likely necessary, but the nil flag is not. A leaner encoding is proposed: kons, kar, kdr, nil, and atom as the standard definitions, dropping the extra nil-tracking. It also suggests avoiding null, car, and cdr by using a pattern-matching construct that dispatches on the second component to handle elements or nil.

## 6. [Wikipedia as a Graph](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45066060)

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece discusses a design choice to ignore bottom-of-page category links on Wikipedia when mapping connections. The author tests Titanic → Zoolander and finds a link from David Bowie to Enrico Caruso via Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award recipients listed at page bottoms. Excluding those category links would remove the direct recipient cluster and add an extra hop: Titanic → Caruso → Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award → Bowie. Overall, the tool is fun and functional, with potential tweaks to improve it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author discusses Wikipedia’s degrees of separation and the Wikigame, noting surprising numbers and paths (e.g., tetris → Family Guy → Star+ → tour de France). They open-source a library to convert Wikipedia dumps into a simpler format with parsers (GitHub: Zulko/wiki_dump_extractor). They’re using it to extract millions of events (who/what/where/when) and plot them on a large map at landnotes.org (example location/date: u07ffpb1-6, 1548).

## 7. [Deploying DeepSeek on 96 H100 GPUs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45064329)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 DeepSeek, a popular open-source LLM, is optimally served using SGLang’s replication on 12 nodes (8 H100 GPUs each) in Atlas Cloud, with prefill-decode disaggregation and large-scale expert parallelism (EP). They achieve 52.3k input tokens/s and 22.3k output tokens/s per node for 2000-token inputs, nearing DeepSeek’s official throughput. Cost is about $0.20 per 1M output tokens (≈5x cheaper than the official API). The approach—DP Attention, DP FFN, MoE EP, and PD Disaggregation—offers up to 5x throughput gains over vanilla tensor parallelism and is fully open-source with reproducible experiments.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Cost-per-token figures assume 100% GPU utilization, but scale introduces factors that cut throughput and margins. There are no on-demand GPUs at scale; you must lock in multi-year contracts, making peak throughput higher than average. GPUs are region-locked due to data and latency concerns, limiting overnight use. Realistic utilization may be 10–20%. Only very large firms might exploit off-peak windows for training/inference. For pure inference, 90% margins are unlikely; a more plausible margin is around 50%, even when costs appear 10× cheaper.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The post, though tangential, analyzes costs to reveal inference margins for providers. It estimates AWS pricing of an 8-H100 node at $31.40/hr (12 nodes = $376.80/hr for 96 GPUs). Throughput is 188M input tokens/hr and 80M output tokens/hr; initial math yields about $2 per million input tokens and $4.70 per million output tokens per node, higher than Deepseek r1. The author later corrects that these figures are per node; dividing by 12 gives about $0.17 per million input tokens and $0.39 per million output tokens, while noting providers may secure better data-center rates.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece argues Grok is the author’s first boycott for environmental reasons. It alleges Grok built its Memphis datacenter without adequate local power and has been illegally powering it with unpermitted gas turbine generators, harming the local population until capacity is expanded.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 A user tested Cline and found it fast, effective with agentic workflows, and capable of decent code. It compares favorably to GPT5-mini (about 1.5$/MTok vs 2$/MTok) and could be a daily driver. Key notes: fast even in EU time zones; agentic behavior uses many small passes; handled a ~110k-token HTML parsing task with bs4 without issues; when a first attempt failed, it created a new test file for mocking and testing before editing the main module. The reviewer sees value in multiple providers to lower prices and doesn’t understand the negativity.

## 10. [SQLite's Durability Settings Are a Mess](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45066999)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Durability in SQLite hinges on fsync. The article argues SQLite’s docs are unclear about defaults. Two knobs matter: journal_mode (DELETE or WAL) and synchronous (EXTRA, FULL, NORMAL, OFF). The author interprets defaults as journal_mode=DELETE and synchronous=FULL, which may not guarantee durability in DELETE mode; in WAL mode, FULL should be durable. A Richard Hipp comment claims the default is durable, contradicting the docs, and notes WAL was weakened for performance. Caveats: libraries may override synchronous; macOS nerfs fsync unless fullfsync is used. Recommendation: set synchronous explicitly; WAL+FULL for durability; DELETE+EXTRA to be safe; docs should be clearer.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Durability depends on both the file system and the disk correctly handling fsync; past discussions suggest this isn’t guaranteed.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 SQLite’s default settings—journal_mode=DELETE and synchronous=FULL—do not guarantee durability after a crash. While FULL may cause fsync after a transaction, that durability often applies to the journal file, not the database file itself. The piece cautions against confusing journal durability with database durability. It also argues that WAL cannot be fully durable because a transaction remains open until checkpointed or committed to the database file.
