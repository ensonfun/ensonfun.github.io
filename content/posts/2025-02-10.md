### Summary

 The article by Mark Dominus discusses the origins of various English surnames derived from nicknames, particularly focusing on patronymic names (names derived from the name of a father or ancestor). Here are the key points:

1. **Common Pattern**: English surnames often follow a pattern where the surname indicates "son of" a particular name, e.g., "Peters" for "Peter's son."

2. **Nicknames as Surnames**: Many surnames come from nicknames of common first names:
   - **John**: Nicknames like "Jack" lead to surnames like Jackson.
   - **William**: Nicknames like "Bill" or "Will" result in surnames like Wilson or Willis.
   - **Richard**: Nicknames "Dick" or "Hick" give us Dickson, Dixon, or Hicks.
   - **Nicholas**: Nicknames "Nick" lead to Nixon or Nicks.

3. **Diminutives and Variations**: Some surnames include diminutive suffixes like "-kin" (e.g., Wilkins for little Will's son) or alterations in spelling due to phonetic changes or regional accents.

4. **Obscure Nicknames**: Some nicknames have become so uncommon that their origins are now obscure, such as "Wat" for Walter leading to Watkins, or "Gib" for Gilbert leading to Gibbs.

5. **Reader Contributions**: The article was updated with contributions from readers, adding more examples like "Hodge" for Roger, "Bat" for Bartholomew, and "At-" for Adam, leading to surnames like Hodgson or Atkinson.

6. **Cultural and Linguistic Notes**: Dominus notes that not all similar sounding names have the same origin (e.g., "Dermott" vs. "Hickmott").

The article provides an engaging exploration of how many modern surnames evolved from the nicknames of ancestors, reflecting changes in language and cultural practices over time.

## 4. [Common mistakes in architecture diagrams (2020)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42990546)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 **Summary of "Common Mistakes in Technical Architecture Diagrams":**

The article discusses seven common mistakes to avoid when creating technical architecture diagrams:

1. **Creating Theoretical Diagrams**: Instead of generic, theoretical diagrams, it's more beneficial to produce concrete diagrams that reflect the specific architecture of an organization. Theoretical diagrams are widely available, whereas specific ones are unique and informative.

2. **Mixing Levels of Abstraction**: Diagrams should not mix high-level and low-level resources in the same view as this can confuse viewers. For clarity, separate diagrams for different abstraction levels should be used.

3. **Overcrowding**: Diagrams often become too busy by trying to convey too many concerns at once. The solution is to split these into multiple, focused diagrams.

4. **Unlabeled Arrows**: Arrows in diagrams should always be labeled to clearly define the relationship between resources, except in very specific, clear contexts where the relationship can be easily inferred.

5. **Misleading Composition**: The layout or composition of elements in a diagram should accurately represent their actual relationships. Misleading compositions can give incorrect impressions about how resources relate or are contained within each other.

6. **Incomplete or Inaccurate Information**: The article suggests that providing irrelevant, too much, or too little information can undermine the diagram's purpose. Each diagram should be tailored to inform effectively about the intended aspect of the architecture.

The overarching theme is to ensure that technical architecture diagrams are clear, specific, and informative, avoiding common errors that could mislead or confuse the audience.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of having a clear purpose for diagrams. The author argues that while details like unlabeled arrows or the amount of information on a diagram might be criticized, their effectiveness depends on the intended use of the diagram. The primary focus should be on whether the diagram serves its communicative purpose effectively, rather than on its completeness or accuracy, drawing a comparison to other schematic representations like roadmaps or the London Underground map.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of architecture diagrams in professional settings, particularly in tech or systems design:

- The author argues against the necessity of creating a single, all-encompassing diagram for architectural designs. Instead, they advocate for the use of multiple diagrams tailored to different purposes:
  1. **Conceptual Diagrams**: These help in explaining the initial ideas or the conceptual framework of the project.
  2. **As Implemented Diagrams**: These show how the conceptual ideas were actually translated into the real system architecture.

- The author highlights the effectiveness of using both types of diagrams when communicating with various stakeholders:
  - Conceptual diagrams are useful for providing an overview that can be easily understood across different levels of the organization, from executives to new hires.
  - The detailed "as implemented" diagrams serve those who need to understand the specifics of the system's construction or future development plans.

- This approach allows for clear storytelling in project explanations, aiding in managing communications with executive management, investors, and new team members by providing both a high-level view and the detailed technical insights.

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 **Summary:**

Researchers from UNSW Sydney have developed a detailed map and classification system for Antarctica's ice-free lands, which make up less than 0.5% of the continent but host a significant portion of its biodiversity. This new framework, published in *Scientific Data*, categorizes these ecosystems into various levels to aid in conservation efforts under the Antarctic Treaty System. The classification includes:

- **Nine Major Environment Units**
- **33 Habitat Complexes**
- **269 Bioregional Ecosystem Types**

The study highlights the unique and fragile ecosystems of Antarctica, which include micro-forests of lichens, mosses, two types of flowering plants, and various small invertebrates and microbes. These areas are crucial for land-breeding seabirds like penguins and petrels. With climate change, these ecosystems face the threat of becoming less isolated and more interconnected, potentially altering their biodiversity dynamics. The research provides a foundation for:

- Systematic risk assessments
- Strategic placement of protected areas
- Monitoring conservation goals

It also supports the upcoming review of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty System and sets a precedent for future ecological research and conservation strategies, including the development of a Red List of Antarctic Ecosystems. This work is vital for preparing for the consequences of environmental changes in Antarctica, known as "Antarctic greening."
