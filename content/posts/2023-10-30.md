**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of pi and its relationship with circles. Pi is defined as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle. The article explores the idea of using different distance functions to measure the circumference of a circle, such as the Manhattan distance and the maximal distance. It also introduces the concept of p-norms, which are a generalization of these distance functions. The article concludes by stating that the value of pi is 3.14159, which is the smallest value possible for all p-norms, and that there are infinitely many metrics that do not fit into the p-norm category.

## 4. [Porting OpenBSD Pledge() to Linux (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38037075)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses the porting of the OpenBSD pledge() security feature to Linux. OpenBSD is known for its focus on security, but it has a small user base. Pledge() is a security layer that makes security comprehensible, unlike Linux, which lacks a user-friendly security layer. The article proposes finding someone with enough free time to implement pledge() using SECCOMP BPF in Linux. The author has developed a command line utility, pledge.com, that can launch processes under pledge() without having to configure it in C code. The utility allows users to set security restrictions for programs, preventing them from performing unauthorized actions. The article provides examples of how the utility can be used to secure various programs. The utility also applies resource limits and offers troubleshooting capabilities. The article concludes with information on how to secure APE (Actually Portable Executable) binaries using pledge.com.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author praises OpenBSD for its implementation of pledge and unveil, as it allows developers to take responsibility for securing the code. They argue that AppArmor and SELinux are more suitable for retrofitting but are difficult to use and prone to errors. The author has observed more clients disabling SELinux or AppArmor rather than spending time on proper configurations. In contrast, pledge and unveil are easier to use and don't require complex configuration.

## 6. [How deep is the brain? The shallow brain hypothesis](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38064287)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of deep learning and predictive coding architectures in accurately modeling neural networks. These architectures assume that neural network inference is hierarchical, but they neglect the neurobiological evidence that all hierarchical cortical areas, whether higher or lower, project to and receive signals directly from subcortical areas. The article introduces the shallow brain hypothesis, which argues that hierarchical cortical processing is integrated with a massively parallel process involving subcortical areas. This shallow architecture takes into account the computational capacity of cortical microcircuits and thalamo-cortical loops, which are not considered in traditional deep learning and predictive coding networks. The authors argue that the shallow brain architecture provides several critical benefits over deep hierarchical structures and offers a more complete understanding of how mammalian brains achieve fast and flexible computational capabilities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the complexity of individual neurons and suggests that the brain may be deeper than what is reflected in the graph of neurons and synapses. It also considers the possibility of constructing a neural net from nodes with more complex behavior. However, it argues that it is more efficient to build a system from simple building blocks, such as using multiple machine learning nodes to simulate a single neuron. This allows for easier experimentation with different neural net architectures.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the structure of the human brain, highlighting its skip connections and massive recurrence. It suggests that the brain can be seen as having infinite depth due to its thalamno-cortical loops. The paper suggests the need for a clearer definition of "depth," mentioning the role of thalamno-cortical loops.

## 9. [Scientists discover why dozens of endangered elephants died](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38032386)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 Scientists have discovered that a little-known bacterium called Pasteurella Bisgaard taxon 45 was responsible for the deaths of 350 elephants in Botswana and 35 elephants in Zimbabwe in 2020. The bacterial infection, which causes blood poisoning, has not previously been linked to elephant deaths. The research team believes it could be the same bacterium responsible for deaths in neighboring countries. African savanna elephants are already facing declining populations due to poaching, and infectious diseases should now be added to the list of threats they face. The elephants' sociability and the drought conditions at the time likely contributed to the outbreak. The Pasteurella bacteria has previously been linked to the sudden death of saiga antelopes in Kazakhstan. Investigations into the elephant deaths were challenging due to difficulties in reaching the carcasses in time and determining the disease involved.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the concerning decline of the African savannah elephant population, despite their habitat being protected. The population is decreasing at a rate of 8% per year, exposing the limitations and decreasing effectiveness of conservation efforts. The article questions our ability to prevent the mass extinction of other species, considering that elephants, which receive significant public support and funding, are still facing such alarming decline.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the elephants died from sepsis caused by Pasteurella bacteria, which is the same bacteria that killed a large number of antelopes in Kazakhstan. The bacteria is commonly found in the throat and tonsils, but in this case, it became more infectious, possibly due to ambient temperature.

## 10. [Assyrian Women of Letters](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38051523)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses the discovery of cuneiform tablets dating back 4,000 years that shed light on the personal lives of Assyrian businesswomen in Mesopotamia. One tablet reveals the anger of a father and mother towards their daughter, Zizizi, for choosing to marry a local man in Anatolia instead of returning to her family after her first husband's death. The tablets, found in the ancient city of Kanesh, provide insights into the lives of highly literate Assyrian women who played important roles in trading networks, managed finances, and pushed against societal expectations. The tablets also discuss topics such as textile production, business partnerships, and personal relationships. The tablets were preserved by chance after a fire destroyed Kanesh, and only a fraction of them have been translated and published. The tablets provide a unique glimpse into the personal lives of ancient Assyrian women and challenge stereotypes of their subservience.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses cuneiform tablets that are written in Assyrian (Akkadian, East Semitic), a language spoken in ancient Assyria. The tablets also contain loanwords from the local language of Kanesh (Kaneš, Kültepe), which is the earliest record of any Indo-European language.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative, which is an effort to catalog tablets from around the world.
