**Total comment counts : 82**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's discovery of a new, automatically enabled feature in Apple's Photos app called "Enhanced Visual Search," which allows for advanced image recognition. This feature was found in both iOS and macOS but was not widely publicized by Apple or the media. The author expresses concerns over privacy, noting that:

1. **Lack of User Consent:** The feature was enabled by default without asking for user consent, which the author finds intrusive.

2. **Privacy Concerns:** The author believes that privacy is compromised when data leaves the device, and criticizes Apple for not keeping data on-device as advertised in past marketing ("What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone").

3. **Technical Trust Issues:** The author admits to not understanding the technical details provided by Apple about how the feature works but remains skeptical due to Apple's history of security vulnerabilities.

4. **Control Over Privacy:** On macOS, users can control outgoing connections with tools like Little Snitch, but iOS does not allow similar tools, which the author sees as Apple restricting user autonomy over their privacy.

5. **User Autonomy:** The author argues that users should have the choice to opt into features that might compromise their privacy, especially when there's no clear benefit to the user.

The article portrays a broader critique of Apple's approach to user privacy and control, emphasizing the need for transparency and user consent in software features that could potentially share data off-device.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses a desire for software that only sends data to the internet with explicit user consent. The author criticizes the trend where software automatically shares user data without clear, prior permission, highlighting issues with privacy and trust. Specifically, they discuss Apple's approach to a new feature, suggesting that Apple might avoid asking for permission because they anticipate user resistance, which reflects broader concerns about how companies handle user data and telemetry.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges and ethical considerations of implementing telemetry (usage tracking) in a free, open-source app. The developer expresses frustration over not being able to gather usage data due to privacy concerns:

- **User Surprise**: Users are surprised to learn the app doesn't collect usage data.
- **Data Bias**: Opt-in telemetry would skew data since only a non-representative subset of users would opt-in.
- **User Opposition**: Opt-out telemetry is seen as invasive by some users, leading to strong opposition.
- **Privacy Concerns**: The developer acknowledges the risks of telemetry being abused or misused, even if anonymized.
- **Regret**: There's a sense of regret that beneficial features (like understanding user needs better) are sacrificed due to these privacy issues. 

The developer feels caught between improving the app through data and respecting user privacy, lamenting the loss of potential improvements due to these constraints.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Joscha Bach, in his talk titled "Self-Models of Loving Grace" at the 38th Chaos Communication Congress (38C3), explores the concept of self-awareness, consciousness, and the models we construct of ourselves and others. Here are some key points from his discussion:

1. **Understanding Self and Others**: Bach discusses how humans create internal models not just of the physical world but also of other minds and their own consciousness. These models help us predict behaviors and understand emotions and thoughts.

2. **Consciousness**: He delves into what consciousness might be, suggesting it's an emergent property of complex information processing. Consciousness, according to Bach, isn't a singular thing but a process where the system (like the brain) becomes aware of its own operations.

3. **Self-Models**: Bach explains that our self-model includes not only our physical body but also our mental states, emotions, and intentions. These models are dynamic, constantly updated by experiences and interactions, and can be seen as an attempt to simulate an ideal self or version of reality.

4. **Love and Grace**: He touches upon how our self-models relate to love and grace. Love, in this context, might be viewed as a deep understanding and connection with another's self-model, while grace could be the acceptance and kindness we extend towards the imperfections in our models of others.

5. **Ethics and AI**: Bach also discusses the implications of these concepts for artificial intelligence. He ponders how AI might develop or simulate self-awareness and what ethical considerations arise when creating entities with such capabilities.

6. **Future of Humanity**: The talk concludes with speculative thoughts on how understanding self-models could influence human evolution, suggesting that with greater control over our self-models, we might engineer better versions of ourselves or even transcend current human limitations.

Overall, Bach's talk intertwines philosophy, cognitive science, and AI to explore how we perceive ourselves and others, aiming to foster a deeper understanding and potentially more compassionate interactions in our increasingly interconnected world.

## 3. [Fish 4.0: The Fish of Theseus](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42535217)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The article discusses the decision by the maintainers of the Fish shell to rewrite it from C++ to Rust, a process initiated about two years ago with a now-famous pull request. Here are the key points:

1. **Popularity and Origin**: The pull request to rewrite Fish in Rust became unexpectedly popular despite being initially intended as an in-joke among developers.

2. **Language Shift**: Fish has undergone significant language shifts before, moving from C to C++, and now to Rust. Rust, which didn't exist when Fish began in 2007, offers a very different programming paradigm.

3. **Reasons for Switching**:
   - **Tooling and Compatibility**: C++ lacks a standardized, easy way to install modern compilers on outdated systems, making it difficult to support users on older Linux distributions or macOS.
   - **Concurrency**: Fish's execution of internal commands is serial, limiting potential features like asynchronous operations. Rust's approach to concurrency was more appealing.
   - **Safety and Ergonomics**: C++ has issues like unsafe functions, verbose string handling, and problematic libraries like curses which were sources of errors and bugs. Rust promises better safety and ergonomics.

4. **Challenges with C++**: 
   - Header files, templates, and the complexity of standard library usage often led to errors.
   - Performance was prioritized over user experience, leading to potential safety issues like use-after-free bugs.

5. **Learning from Experience**: The article reflects on what was learned from the transition, aiming to provide insights for others considering similar shifts in programming languages for their projects.

6. **Community and Contributions**: C++ did not attract many contributors to Fish, possibly due to its complexity and the learning curve associated with it.

The rewrite to Rust, now in its beta phase with Fish 4.0, is presented as a case study in adopting modern, safer programming practices while improving the development and user experience.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 10. [Libsearch: Simple index-free full-text search for JavaScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42537665)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses `libsearch`, a JavaScript library designed for simple, index-free full-text search. Here are the key points:

- **Functionality**: `libsearch` provides a basic full-text search across JavaScript objects without the need for a pre-built search index, making it suitable for small to medium-sized datasets in client-side web applications. It uses regular expressions to match search queries, offering a performance that's sufficient for real-time searching.

- **API**: The library exposes a single `search` function which requires two arguments (the query and the data to search) and has two optional arguments for additional options.

- **Performance**: Instead of indexing, which is common in more feature-rich search libraries, `libsearch` leverages modern JavaScript's optimized regex engines to perform searches directly on the text. This approach avoids the overhead of index maintenance but can be slower for very large datasets.

- **Search Method**: It transforms search queries into a series of regular expressions, filtering documents through these expressions during runtime. This method approximates traditional TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scoring by using document length rather than word count for efficiency.

- **Usage**: `libsearch` can be integrated into web applications by including its script in HTML or through npm for Node.js environments. It comes with TypeScript type definitions for better integration with TypeScript projects.

- **Development**: The source code is written in TypeScript, with builds available for both ES modules and browser environments. The developer emphasizes simplicity and ease of use over the extensive feature sets found in other search libraries.

- **Advantages and Limitations**: While it lacks some advanced features of other search libraries like lemmatization or complex indexing, `libsearch` offers a straightforward, fast enough solution for prototyping or applications where search isn't the primary function but still needed.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the lightweight nature of TypeScript (TS) code, mentioning that while it's only 115 lines, some important features might still be missing. It provides a link to a GitHub repository (`uFuzzy`) where users can compare JavaScript alternatives based on size, features, and performance. The author mentions their own experience of evaluating these options a few years ago and choosing `uFuzzy`, linking to a demonstration of `uFuzzy` search functionality.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the ease of building a search functionality using what appears to be a sophisticated regular expression (RegEx) engine. The author expresses intrigue about how this library manages fuzzy search capabilities, like recognizing "Califnia" instead of "California," and finds the implementation reasoning of this library interesting and clever.
