### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of sampling coordinates from a large enough set in order to prevent attackers from guessing them by random chance. It mentions that if the modulus is near 2^256, this is not a problem. However, with a modulus of 2^64 - 2^32 + 1 or lower, there is a higher risk of the attacker being able to guess the coordinates. To mitigate this, the article suggests sampling r from an extension field. The author compares this to increasing entropy without actually adding entropy, similar to brute-forcing a low entropy preimage in a hash. The author acknowledges that they may be misunderstanding the article due to unclear exposition.

## 8. [Emoji History: The Missing Years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40331928)

### Summary

 The article discusses the discovery of vintage Japanese drawing devices that have built-in sketch and memo functions. The author purchased the Sharp PI-4000, a pocket computer released in 1994, which features a memo function that allows users to draw in different shades and widths. Surprisingly, the device also contains recognizable emojis, which goes against the commonly known history of emojis being created in 1997 and 1999. Further research reveals that other devices, such as the NEC PI-ET1 in 1991 and the Sharp WD-A521 in 1990, also contained emojis. The article explores the possibility of other word processors and pagers from that time period incorporating emojis as well.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the rise and widespread adoption of emoji, which are ideograms – a type of character that was largely unfamiliar to most of the world. While it's not surprising that emoji originated in Japan, a country with an established ideographic writing system, their adoption in places primarily using alphabets is intriguing. The author wonders if emoji use will evolve to allow people without a common spoken language to communicate using them, similar to how classical Chinese has historically been used in East Asia. The author suggests that this evolution may already be underway based on observations of emoji-filled comment sections on streaming platforms.
