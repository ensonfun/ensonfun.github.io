## 1. [NoLongerEvil-Thermostat – Nest Generation 1 and 2 Firmware](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45813343)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article promotes an experimental firmware loader for Nest Thermostat Gen 1/2 that uses the OMAP DFU interface to flash a custom bootloader and kernel. Once installed, the device stops contacting Nest/Google and runs on a NoLongerEvil backend, granting user control but risking device brickage and unpredictable behavior. It outlines setup steps (tools for macOS/Linux/Windows, libusb), DFU-mode flashing, and linking to the NoLongerEvil account after reboot. It warns against using on critical devices, emphasizes backups, and states intentions to open-source the firmware and backend for transparency and right-to-repair.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on a thermostat project that claims openness (firmware and backend open-sourcing) but currently relies on cloud services and lacks clear privacy policies, prompting debate over true user control.
- Concern: The main worry is privacy and control risks, including unclear data flows, third-party logins, and potential dependency on proprietary infrastructure that could undermine user autonomy or lead to bricking.
- Perspectives: Participants range from skeptical critics who distrust the project’s openness and privacy stance to hopeful supporters who expect future open-source disclosures and self-hosted options, plus practical considerations about compatibility with Home Assistant, OpenTherm, and alternative hardware.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 2. [Pg_lake: Postgres with Iceberg and data lake access](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45812606)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 pg_lake integrates Iceberg and data-lake files with PostgreSQL, turning Postgres into a lakehouse that supports transactions and fast queries on Iceberg tables and raw data in object stores like S3. It uses two components: PostgreSQL with pg_lake extensions and a separate pgduck_server process that runs DuckDB and speaks the Postgres wire protocol. Setup can be via Docker; credentials follow AWS/GCP chains; set Iceberg default_location_prefix; create Iceberg tables with USING iceberg; data import/export with COPY (Parquet, CSV, JSON). Architecture separates query execution to DuckDB for performance. Origin: Crunchy Data; later Snowflake open-sourced in 2025 as pg_lake 3.0.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on Crunchy Data’s open-source PostgreSQL extension (pg_lake) that adds Iceberg data lake support and uses DuckDB as the query engine, sparking excitement and market-style comparisons.

- Concern: A key worry is that Snowflake’s release could cannibalize its own core product or that the extension may face practical limitations and incomplete feature support.

- Perspectives: Opinions range from enthusiastic optimism about open-source, Snowflake-like capabilities for PostgreSQL to skepticism about practicality, feature gaps, and how it stacks up against DuckLake, pg_duckdb, and related approaches.

- Overall sentiment: Cautiously optimistic

## 3. [This Day in 1988, the Morris worm infected 10% of the Internet within 24 hours](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45812024)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 In 1988, Cornell student Robert Tappan Morris released a self-replicating worm that infected about 6,000 of roughly 60,000 connected systems—≈10% of the Internet. Written in C, it targeted BSD UNIX (VAX, Sun-3), exploiting a backdoor in the e-mail system and a bug in finger; it didn’t destroy files but caused massive slowdowns and outages. He released it by hacking into an MIT computer from Ithaca. The FBI later confirmed Morris as the culprit; he was indicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, receiving probation, a fine, and 400 hours of community service. The Web wasn’t yet dominant; NSFNET ruled.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on the 1988 Morris worm incident, its historical context, and the people involved, examining rumors, sources, and the accuracy of public coverage. 
- Concern: The main worry is that misinformation and misattribution (e.g., about Paul Graham and others) could spread and distort the legacy of the event. 
- Perspectives: Perspectives vary from alleged connections and involvement to corrections about claims (like the 10% figure), with references to sources such as CACM and multiple personal recollections. 
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 9. [Singing bus horns in West Sumatra](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45692042)

**Total comment counts : 0**

### Summary

 Field recordings highlight kalason oto, a musical car horn of West Sumatra’s Minangkabau. Originated with Bukittinggi bus drivers in the 1950s who tuned spare horns to a musical scale and connected them to a keyboard beside the steering wheel. Initially eight notes, later extended to fourteen or more, enabling one-handed playing that fused Minangkabau melodies with regional rhythms. The practice grew with the marantau migration as drivers sang along on routes to ports across Sumatra. Pak Budahar, from Alahan Panjang, joined as a tukang kalason at 11 and built a decades-long career, touring the island and spreading music.

## 10. [What is a manifold?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45809193)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article explains manifolds as abstract geometric spaces introduced by Bernhard Riemann that generalize curved geometries beyond Euclidean space. Historically, geometry focused on flat spaces, but some mathematicians explored spaces where Euclidean rules fail. Riemann’s 1854 lecture proposed spaces of any dimension, ideas initially ignored but later embraced, shaping topology, geometry, and physics. Einstein used them in general relativity, linking theory to the real world. A manifold locally resembles Euclidean space, providing a common language across disciplines. Example: a circle is a one-dimensional manifold that locally looks like a line.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion revolves around what a manifold is in rigorous mathematics, how that concept is used across disciplines (data science, physics, cartography), and how effectively it is communicated to non-specialists.
- Concern: The main worry is that popular uses of "manifold" may misrepresent the formal notion or oversimplify it, leading to misunderstandings or superficial reasoning.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from enthusiastic praise for formal treatments and accessible explanations to skepticism about popular articles' accuracy and usefulness, with debates on whether data manifolds truly require atlas/charts or are simply convenient metaphors.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
