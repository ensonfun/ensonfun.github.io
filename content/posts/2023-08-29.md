## 1. [Keystroke timing obfuscation added to ssh(1)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37307708)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses the recent addition of keystroke timing obfuscation support to the SSH protocol in OpenBSD. This security measure is seen as an example of security through trickery and is expected to be available in other systems soon. The addition of this feature is seen as a practical security solution.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the importance of keystroke timing in terminal input/output (I/O) for security purposes. The use of buffered I/O for password entry is highlighted as a crucial security feature. This means that nothing is sent to the other end until the user presses the return key, making it difficult for a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacker to intercept the password. However, there were instances in the past where applications accepted passwords in an unbuffered mode, allowing for characters to be echoed as the user typed them. While this feature gave users feedback, it inadvertently leaked keystroke timing information. The article concludes by expressing the continued relevance of buffered I/O for password entry and acknowledging the value of ssh in protecting content that cannot be buffered, such as shell and editor input.

 The article discusses Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the 1960s and their unique approach to transportation for their employees. DEC, based in Maynard, Massachusetts, was expanding at a rapid pace but struggled to find office space nearby. As a solution, they purchased additional campuses around Boston and established their own helicopter service to transport employees between locations. This approach was not limited to executives but extended to all employees, emphasizing the company's egalitarian policy. In fact, DEC had state-of-the-art video-conferencing facilities that were rarely used because employees found it more appealing to travel by helicopter.

## 5. [SEC charges Impact Theory for unregistered offering of NFTs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37295817)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Impact Theory, LLC, a media and entertainment company based in Los Angeles, with conducting an unregistered offering of crypto assets in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Impact Theory raised around $30 million from hundreds of investors through the offering. The SEC's order states that Impact Theory offered and sold three tiers of NFTs called "Founder's Keys," claiming that investors would profit from their purchases if the company was successful. The SEC found that the NFTs offered were investment contracts and thus securities, which violated federal securities laws. Impact Theory has agreed to a cease-and-desist order and will pay over $6.1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The company will also establish a Fair Fund to return money to injured investors and destroy all Founder's Keys in its possession.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) were originally created to bypass regulations surrounding securities offerings by claiming to be "digital artworks." However, the article mentions that some NFTs, like the one being discussed, were clearly marketed as a way to make money fast, which falls under the definition of a security according to the Securities Act of 1934. The article points out that regardless of the contract terms, if an item is marketed, bought, sold, and held as a means of making money, it is considered a security. The author suggests that this form of financial scamming has been occurring even before the establishment of the Securities Act.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the importance of bipartisan dissent in the view of digital assets. It praises Commissioner Mark T Uyeda for being a Democrat and sharing dissimilar views with Hester Pierce, a Republican who supports digital assets. The author suggests that people who do not support digital assets may need to align with a Republican presidential candidate to get their preferred appointments. The article argues that it is insufficient for regulators to simply dislike digital assets; they must establish jurisdiction and provide clear guidelines for the industry. The author also mentions that enforcement actions are not routinely taken against sellers of other tangible items, so there should either be a comprehensive crackdown on all such products or a clear distinction made for crypto asset creators to act solely as consumer products.

## 6. [Loose lips save sunken ships](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37289756)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of Boston is a popular fishing spot and a route for whale migration. However, it is also home to around 200 shipwrecks that hold cultural and historical significance. The area is frequently dredged by commercial fishing vessels, including during the scallop season, which can have a devastating impact on the wrecks. Concerned about this damage, the sanctuary decided to change its approach and work with fishermen by releasing the coordinates of some wrecks and implementing a geofence system to warn them to keep their gear away. A collaboration with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution was also initiated to survey and document the wrecks. The goal is to protect these underwater cultural heritage sites and create richer habitats for marine life. Although there have been challenges, the sanctuary remains optimistic about the progress being made in protecting the shipwrecks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the policy of keeping coordinates of wrecks hidden to prevent looting. This is considered a reasonable policy since looters can cause further damage to marine environments by harvesting valuable materials such as copper, bronze, low-background steels, and memorabilia from wrecks.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of fishing nets becoming a significant source of microplastics in the ocean. Despite the potential dangers and costs involved, some captains are willing to take the risk. The article suggests that legislation at a society level is challenging due to international zone laws and enforcement difficulties. At a personal level, individuals can make a small but impactful change by choosing to stop consuming fish. Additionally, the article provides a link to a scientific study on the topic for further information.

## 7. [The sudden demise of Indian vultures killed thousands of people](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37301400)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The near-extinction of Indian vultures in the 1990s had a negative impact on human health, causing a rise in the mortality rate. Vultures play a crucial role as nature's sanitation service, consuming rotting livestock carcasses and destroying germs with their strongly acidic digestive tracts. However, the vultures' population declined by over 90% due to the use of diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug given to cattle that proved harmful to the birds. Without vultures, carcasses attracted feral dogs and rats, spreading diseases and pathogens to humans through drinking water. A study estimates that the loss of vultures caused 500,000 additional human deaths between 2000 and 2005. The conservation of "keystone species" like vultures should be a priority, as they play a vital role in ecosystems.

 The author recalls seeing vultures on their grandparents' terrace in New Delhi during the 1990s. However, they later noticed that the vultures had disappeared and eventually learned that it was due to the use of Diclofenac, a medication harmful to vultures.

## 8. [Accessible Palette: stop using HSL for color systems (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37307473)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's mission to reconstruct a color system in Postmark to address problems with their design system. The old color palette had inconsistent perceived lightness and unpredictable contrast ratios. The author explains that the problems are due to the inherent faults in the HSL color model and the lack of support for better alternatives in design tools. They introduce the CIELAB or L*a*b* color space as a better alternative that closely matches human perception. The article also mentions the limitations of the sRGB gamut and the lack of widespread adoption of the CIELAB color space in design tools. The author then introduces the Accessible Palette app, which is a tool for building color systems with consistent lightness and predictable contrast ratios. The app utilizes the Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) to calculate contrast ratios. The article concludes by highlighting the benefits of using the Accessible Palette app to create consistent and accessible color palettes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the brightness and saturation of red, blue, and green colors in ordinary display and print systems. It mentions that saturated reds and blues are usually darker than greens. The formula "Grayscale = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B" is commonly quoted for calculating grayscale values (possibly for sRGB color space). The article suggests that while contrast rules can make color choices accessible, they may not always make them look good. It also mentions that saturated screen greens are not as saturated as they could be, but are more saturated than most real-life greens. The author provides an example of how trees and grass look great in stereograms because they contain a lot of red, which balances the channels for good stereo and color effects.

### Top 2 Comment Summary
