## 2. [AI is not a coworker, it's an exoskeleton](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47078324)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 AI is best used as an exoskeleton, amplifying human decision-making rather than acting autonomously. The article warns against agentic AI and promotes AI that deeply researches and analyzes, then presents insights for humans to decide actions. Kasava exemplifies this: its AI reads every commit, code changes, issues, PRs, and transcripts, analyzes patterns and risks at scale, but it doesn’t decide what to do. It surfaces themes, sentiment, and debt, then leaves decisions to people. Kasava’s product graph provides two context layers—auto-generated data from your repo and human interpretation—so teams tie insights to outcomes.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether LLMs are mere tools to amplify human work or harbingers of widespread software engineer replacement, with opinions diverging on timelines and impact.
- Concern: The main worry is potential rapid displacement of workers like SWEs, fueled by hype and claims about imminent changes, as well as the risk of misaligned expectations.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from seeing AI as a helpful, human-guided assistant or intern to skepticism about true autonomy and fear of hype-driven notions of replacement.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

- Concern: The main worry is whether such a sophisticated system will be usable by non-technical users, given preferences for accessible UI and simpler data formats, and whether sqlite-based storage or heavy setup will hinder adoption.
- Perspectives: Differing viewpoints range from enthusiastic supporters eager for wide features and integrations (cron reminders, web or TUI interfaces, Home Assistant integration) to pragmatists favoring simpler, human-editable data formats and to critics worried the project will be too technical for typical households.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 4. [Micropayments as a reality check for news sites](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47078167)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 Rick Bruner argues micropayments can revive journalism as readers consumer content from many outlets beyond traditional subscriptions. Micropayments could unlock incremental revenue and enhance ad pricing by providing verifiable, human engagement amid bot activity and opaque platforms. Publishers could introduce coin-based access—as subscriber perks or free coins for non-subscribers—and extend coins to advertisers and promotions. The goal is to supplement, not replace, subscriptions, inspired by mobile-game economics. With Big Tech eroding ROI, advertisers need accurate, randomized experiments to measure impact rather than relying on correlations.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether micropayments can work for news and what viable alternatives (like bundled subscriptions) might look like.  
- Concern: The main worry is that micropayments for news are socially and economically unviable, leading to unstable revenue and reduced quality of journalism.  
- Perspectives: Opinions range from dismissing micropayments in favor of subscription bundles to proposing experimental micro-fees, blockchain-based schemes, or enhanced UX/privacy tools, with many doubtful publishers would embrace micropayments.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 5. [Show HN: Ghostty-based terminal with vertical tabs and notifications](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47079718)

**Total comment counts : 2**

### Summary

 This project introduces cmux, a native macOS terminal app built with Swift/AppKit that uses libghostty for terminal rendering and reads Ghostty config. It adds a vertical-tabs sidebar and a notification system for AI coding agents, enabling status indicators, unread highlights, and per-workspace notifications. It supports OSC 9/99/777 terminal sequences and has a CLI (cmux notify) to wire into agents like Claude Code. It includes an in-app browser with a scriptable API for automating UI interactions, and is fully scriptable via CLI/socket API. Install via .dmg; auto-updates via Sparkle. AGPL-3.0-or-later.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Feedback on a vertical-tab UI for a terminal app is broadly positive, with noted drag-and-drop quirks, requests for features like tab coloring and a drop-target indicator, and a question about upstreaming into Ghostty rather than building a separate app.
- Concern: The dragging behavior is unreliable and mouseup effects are unclear, and the lack of a drop-target indicator could degrade usability.
- Perspectives: Some contributors praise the concept and suggest enhancements, while another asks about upstreaming the work into Ghostty instead of creating a separate application.
- Overall sentiment: Cautiously optimistic
