## 1. [Cursorless is alien magic from the future](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38214915)

**Total comment counts : 47**

### Summary

 The author discusses their experience using the Cursorless plugin for Visual Studio Code, which integrates voice control software to enable code editing. The plugin allows for precise navigation and manipulation of code using spoken commands based on the structure of the code's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Targets and destinations are identified by colored hats placed above individual code elements, and the plugin can perform actions across the entire code, such as selecting and manipulating functions or lambdas. The author describes the process of learning and using Cursorless commands, as well as creating custom commands using Talon, another voice control software. They also mention experimenting with a different way to explain pointer concepts in Go programming using the concept of "raising" and "lowering." The author expresses interest in comparing Cursorless with GitHub Copilot's voice coding capabilities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is surprised to see it gaining popularity. They share a repository of Talon experiments they are working on, which can be found at the provided GitHub link.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a new approach that utilizes the tree-sitter abstract syntax tree for performing operations on different parts of a text buffer. This approach is similar to textobjects in Vim/Evil but includes a spoken component. The author sees promise in this approach, especially if it incorporates a "record and perform" feature, allowing users to speak commands while executing other actions. This would eliminate the need to alternate between typing and speaking, making the writing process more seamless. The author also mentions that being able to type and speak simultaneously would engage different parts of cognition and improve the flow state. Additionally, the author suggests that this approach could be used for taking notes. Finally, the author humorously predicts the development of an Emacs package based on this approach.

The author shares a personal experience where a project to redesign a corporate homepage took much longer than necessary due to the creation of unnecessary sub-teams. The author reflects on why this happened and eventually realizes that it was a way for their boss to increase headcount, secure a promotion, and receive a pay raise.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article shares a story about a conversation they had with someone who mentioned that it would be difficult to fire them due to paperwork. The author expresses that they would take advantage of this situation by working on an open-source project, even if it had to be under the name of their employer. They see it as an opportunity to get paid for doing something they enjoy that would also benefit others.

## 3. [Typing fast is about latency, not throughput](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38213158)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The author challenges the common misconception that typing speed above 80 words per minute is not important. They argue that while throughput (the amount of work produced) may not be hindered, latency (the delay in thought process) becomes an issue. Fast typing allows for quick revisions and structuring of sentences for writers, while for coders, it enables better organization and flow of thoughts. The author emphasizes that even a mere three-second delay in typing can be frustrating and disrupt the thought process.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the relationship between typing speed, accuracy, and the flow of thoughts. The author, who is a competitive typist and programmer, believes that typing no longer requires much thought because they can simply think of the code they want to write and it is transcribed onto the computer. The author also emphasizes the importance of typing accurately rather than quickly, as typing competitions require 100% accuracy. This accuracy gives the author confidence that what they are typing is correct without the need to constantly look at it, which could potentially derail their thoughts from the actual code.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how many companies have low developer productivity and allow their code output to degrade. The author shares their own experience, stating that even junior developers at their startup can ship a couple hundred lines of code per week, while the most productive ones average around 1,000 lines of code per week. The author emphasizes the importance of maintaining a fast development environment, efficient testing and deployment processes, and minimizing risk. They also mention that about 60% of overall development time is spent on product-related tasks. The author finds it shocking that some companies accept an average of only 125 lines of code per week as the norm, and highlights the need for companies to improve their productivity levels.

## 4. [Switching to Elixir](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38214644)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 The author recently started a job at a company that uses Elixir as its main backend language. Despite having no previous experience with Elixir or Erlang, they found it easy to pick up due to its Ruby-inspired syntax. They appreciate that Elixir does not have classes, instances, or inheritance, making it immutable and functional. They believe that this eliminates the difficulties of maintaining code with mutable state. Elixir also supports DSLs through compile-time macros, providing errors at compile time rather than runtime. The author enjoys the pipeline syntax in Elixir and also mentions a preference for Clojure's threading operators. They particularly like Elixir's "with" expression, which splits complex functions into happy paths and error handling. The author appreciates the use of Result/Either monads over exceptions in Elixir. After three months of using Elixir, they find it enjoyable and believe it carries on the fun aspect of programming that Ruby has.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author has been watching Elixir YouTube videos and has developed an interest in the language. They appreciate the ideas of Erlang but find it quirky. The author believes that Elixir's use of isolated processes and message passing is promising for distributed programming. However, they express concern about the complexity of certain concepts and the risk associated with niche languages and platforms. Despite this, they are impressed with the Elixir community and are excited to see what happens with the language's type system implementation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of using Elixir/Erlang for running "background jobs" without worrying about blocking IO. The author recounts a previous experience where they had to handle HTTP requests in a webhook handler, which would occasionally cause the entire site to crash due to the OS processes being overwhelmed. The author expresses a desire to use Elixir instead, as it would have allowed them to easily spin up a Task to handle the requests and continue processing.

## 5. [Rust â€“ Faster compilation with the parallel front-end in nightly](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38216176)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The Rust compiler's front-end can now use parallel execution, which significantly reduces compile times. This feature is currently experimental and can be tried by running the nightly compiler with the -Z threads=8 option. The addition of parallelism in the front-end complements the existing parallelism in the back-end and interprocess parallelism used by Cargo. The front-end is split into two halves, with the new parallel execution implemented in the first half. The parallel front-end uses fine-grained parallelism and synchronized data structures to perform compilation tasks. When the parallel front-end is enabled and configured with multiple threads, compile times can be reduced by up to 50%, although the improvement varies depending on the code and build configuration. However, caution is advised as the parallel front-end is still under development and may have threading bugs. The parallel front-end is expected to be shipped in stable releases in 2024.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their opinion that compilation speed is the main drawback of using Rust. They mention that while working with a Rust monorepo, their biggest complaint was the slow compilation speed, which made CI/CD more expensive and could cause delays in development if the cache needed to be removed. However, the author appreciates the progress being made to address this issue.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses enthusiasm for using Rust, despite its slow compilation times in the past. They have been using Rust extensively and are happy with it. However, they mention that one of their projects has grown and now takes over 5 seconds to compile even for a simple change. This has become a frustration for them, and they hope for progress in improving the compilation times.

## 6. [An implementation of Common Lisp targeting Lua](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38204378)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses Lua Common Lisp (LCL), which is an implementation of Common Lisp that targets the Lua language. The goal of LCL is to provide a Common Lisp implementation that can run on any Lua VM. LCL includes a Common Lisp to Lua compiler and can be used by directly calling Lisp functions from Lua. However, it is important to note that LCL is still under development and many functions and macros are either missing or incomplete. The article also provides details on how to compile and use LCL, as well as the different data structures and calling conventions supported by LCL.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article asks if there is a subset of Common Lisp code that has been implemented in Lua+CL. It also questions the availability of historic code that was created when trying to achieve compatibility between different Lisp variants.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that the person is looking for something similar to a tool that exists for another programming language called Go. They believe that such a tool would work well because both Go and the other language use mutable data structures, have garbage collection, and are expected to have good performance. The tool would allow them to use all the Go libraries in the other language.

## 7. [Nordic is getting involved in RISC-V](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38218667)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Nordic Semiconductor has joined a consortium of semiconductor companies to support the adoption of open source chip architecture RISC-V.

 Researchers at West Virginia University are working on a process to extract rare earth elements from acid mine drainage, a byproduct of coal mining. This process aims to not only clean up the environmental hazard of acid mine drainage but also produce valuable rare earth elements from what would otherwise be waste. The team has received $8 million in funding for this project, which could have significant economic and environmental benefits.

## 10. [Link-Time Optimisation (LTO)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38215535)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article provides a comprehensive overview of Link-Time Optimization (LTO), a technique used to improve runtime performance by analyzing and optimizing code across multiple files. The author explains the basic workflow of traditional compilation and linking without LTO, where each source code file is optimized separately and the object files are linked to produce the final output. 

In contrast, with LTO, each source code file is compiled to produce an object file that contains the compiler's internal representation (IR) instead of machine code. The linking stage then performs whole-program analysis and optimization using the IR from all source units. This enables the removal of unused symbols and the inlining of functions from other source units, among other optimizations.

The article further explores different variations of LTO, such as basic LTO, parallel LTO, and thin LTO. Basic LTO involves combining all compilation units into a single module for analysis and optimization. It achieves a significant runtime performance improvement but consumes more memory and time during compilation and linking. Parallel LTO, on the other hand, processes compilation units in parallel, resulting in faster compilation times while still benefiting from most of the same optimizations as basic LTO. Thin LTO eliminates the use of IR in the whole-program analysis step but still provides runtime performance improvements.

The article also mentions other variants of LTO, such as unified LTO and fat LTO objects, and hints at more advanced features and techniques. The author welcomes feedback and intends to update the guide with additional information.

Overall, the article serves as a helpful resource for those interested in understanding the different dimensions and features of LTO across various compilers and linking tools. It provides insights into the benefits, trade-offs, and technical details of implementing LTO.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article points out a misconception by stating that LLVM has had LTO (Link-Time Optimization) available for a long time, even before GCC. It also mentions that RMS (Richard Stallman) permitted the saving of GCC's intermediate representation (IR) to disk partially in response to LLVM's popularity. Additionally, the article remarks that the distinction between function summary and non-summary modes is important but has been overlooked.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that certain language implementation strategies don't have LTO-like features, and the author has ignored them in the discussion. JVM implementations and ART, along with CLR, do provide optimizations similar to LTO. Additionally, profile-guided optimization (PGO) is now commonly used, allowing information to be carried over between runs and aiding the JIT compiler in quickly achieving optimal execution.
