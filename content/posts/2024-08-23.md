## 1. [We need to liberate the Postcode Address File](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41326604)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The British government attempted to reconstruct the Ship of Theseus, or Trigger's Broom, which is a metaphor for the challenge they faced in reconstructing the UK Postcode Address File (PAF). In 2013, the government privatized Royal Mail and along with it, the ownership and management of the PAF. This database lists all physical postal addresses in the country and is a valuable resource for various purposes. However, accessing this dataset is expensive, making it a barrier for innovation and economic growth. The government had allocated funds to develop a freely available address register, but eight years later, the PAF remains behind a paywall. A research paper funded by the government showed an attempt to reconstruct the PAF without using Royal Mail's intellectual property, but the results were disastrous. The only solution to unlock growth and innovation is for the government to regain control of the PAF and release it as open data.

 The French government has created a national address database called "BAN" (Base Adresse Nationale) which includes detailed postal addresses and GPS coordinates. They have also provided interfaces to view and update the data, as well as free APIs for address search and geocoding. The data is openly licensed and available for download. Localities are required by law to contribute their own local address databases. The original data comes from various sources, including the French Royal Mail and OpenStreetMap.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The British postcode system is more specific than postal code systems in other countries. In the UK, there are 2,643,732 postcodes, with an average of one code per 25 people. This allows postcodes to be used as a proxy for exact locations, making it easier to find addresses using sat-nav. However, this system may not work well in rural areas or large estates where the access point differs from the actual location, leading to the need for different postcodes for navigation.

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses the addition of CORS support for Anthropic's JSON APIs. This new feature allows users to call the Claude LLMs directly from their browser. The article explains that CORS support was previously resisted due to the security risks of embedding API keys in client code. However, legitimate use cases exist, such as internal tools or implementing a "bring your own API key" pattern. The author shares their experience of building a client-side app that now utilizes CORS support to directly communicate with Anthropic's API. The article concludes with a JavaScript snippet demonstrating how to call the API from a browser using the new header.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author describes their preference for creating web apps that utilize a "bring your own keys" model, which combines the convenience of executable file distribution with the benefits of open source. They have developed two web apps so far: one for live transcription and translation using microphone input, and another for translating SRT subtitles into different languages. The author favors this model for two main reasons: low maintenance and low cost. They want to continue distributing these apps without the need for constant attention from them and without the use of ads for monetization. This approach allows them to create and share useful tools while minimizing both their maintenance burden and user costs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article argues that humans are not generally intelligent but rather possess intelligence that is well adapted to their specific environment as a hominid family animal in a tribe or clan in a savannah habitat. Our senses and brains are well suited to reasoning about and making decisions in environments at a "human" scale, but we lack intuition for relativistic, atomic, and quantum phenomena. Therefore, our intuition fails us at these scales, indicating that our intelligence is not general but rather specific to being a hominid.

## 6. [17-Year-Old Student Exposes Germany's 'Secret' Pirate Site Blocklist](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41328784)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 A 17-year-old student in Germany has created a website called CUIIliste.de to expose and publish all the domain names that are blocked by internet service providers (ISPs) in the country. The ISP blocking is part of a piracy site blocking scheme implemented in Germany in 2021, in collaboration with copyright holders. The blocked domain names are not disclosed publicly, which has frustrated journalists and others who want transparency. The student and his friends created the website to provide transparency and advocate against censorship and for freedom of expression. The website currently lists 104 domain names that are blocked by ISPs in Germany. While the ISP blocking scheme claims to only target structurally infringing domain names, without transparency, it is difficult to verify this claim. The student's website also provides information on ways to circumvent the blocking efforts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is surprised that none of the well-known torrent and book sites they use are included in a list they came across. They speculate that everyone in Germany who torrent already uses a VPN due to the risk of receiving legal letters and fines from lawyers. The author also questions if the exclusion of popular torrent sites is a means to generate income for these lawyers specializing in pursuing downloaders.

Lastly, it mentions Tailscale as another option for improving internet security.

## 7. [When Serial Isn't RS-232, Geocaching with the Garmin GPS 95](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41286753)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with an early 1990s Garmin GPS receiver. They found that while the longitude and latitude were accurate, the altitude and date were incorrect. The altitude issue is inherent to GPS, but the date issue can be fixed. The GPS receiver uses a week counter and time of week signal to compute the date, but it requires a way to determine the week counter epoch. The first GPS rollover occurred in August 1999, and Garmin released a tool to adjust the receiver's clock. The author encountered communication issues with the receiver when attempting to adjust the date using a Windows 98SE virtual machine. They also experienced difficulties decoding NMEA messages from the receiver using the Flipper Zero application. The author investigated the voltage levels and signal encoding used by the GPS receiver and found that it used a type of serial that operated between 0-5V with inverted data lines, similar to RS-232 but without the need for an extra voltage rail.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of determining an unknown electrical interface for transmitting serial data. It emphasizes the importance of using a scope to reverse-engineer the device. If the interface is documented, it becomes easier to identify and decode the data. However, in cases where there is no documentation, experience and knowledge are crucial in deciphering the electrical signal and decoding the data.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author shares a frustrating experience with a GNSS product's datasheet that lacked clear instructions on how to select the supported communication protocols. After contacting the manufacturer, they spent weeks going back and forth with the sales team until they were able to speak with an engineer who quickly resolved the issue by explaining that the device would auto detect the protocol. The author finds this to be their most frustrating manufacturer interaction and suggests that the manufacturer could have avoided the situation by including the information in the datasheet.

 The article discusses the dilemma of whether to use frequentist statistics or Bayesian statistics in hypothesis-driven development, particularly when conducting A/B or multivariate testing. The author recommends additional sources for further understanding, including articles from the Red Journal and Amplitude, as well as a PDF from indico.cern.ch.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses misinterpretations of the p-value and highlights an ironic error in its analysis. The author points out that in an example provided, Bernstein incorrectly interprets the p-value as the probability of the null hypothesis, when in fact it represents the probability of rejecting the null when it is true. The mistake lies in Bernstein's understanding of the p-value as an unconditional probability instead of a conditional one.

Kardinal integrates with existing distributed tracing and configures a service mesh for traffic routing. It provides an isolated, logical dev environment with a simple command and allows testing of new features in an isolated traffic flow. Overall, Kardinal streamlines the deployment process and improves the efficiency of Kubernetes clusters.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author designed a system similar to the one described in the article, but found it to be dirty. They suggest a better approach of having a service registry to track versions, values, and clusters where changes have been made. However, this would require a different API or extending the k8s API and dealing with the authentication/authorization system. The author believes that a major hurdle to implementing this solution is that the application must be a 12 factor app, which is often not the case. Hardcoded values in the code and containers make it difficult to add nodes to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The author also mentions the challenges of tracking different gateways, destination routes, and other components at the mesh level. They suggest using labels to track components across the cluster. Additionally, the author acknowledges that being tied to a specific service mesh implementation, like Istio, can be limiting and prevents exploring other networking alternatives. However, they appreciate that the project uses Nix.
