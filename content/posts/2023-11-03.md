### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The trial report by Inner City Press highlights the thorough and strategic approach taken by the prosecutors. The evidence presented was solid, the cross-examination was skillfully executed, and the closing argument was forceful. The defense, however, was weak and relied on irrelevant details such as the defendant's work ethic. Their closing argument centered around the claim that the defendant used the customer's money for business-related expenses, rather than personal gain, thus denying any criminal intent.

## 2. [Bringing garbage collected programming languages efficiently to WebAssembly](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38125348)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 This article discusses the different approaches for porting garbage-collected (GC) languages to WebAssembly (Wasm) and compares the traditional porting approach with the Wasm Garbage Collection (WasmGC) approach. The traditional porting approach involves compiling the language's runtime into WasmMVP, while the WasmGC approach compiles the language down to GC constructs in Wasm itself. WasmGC offers several advantages, including automatic memory management, better garbage collection efficiency, reduced memory fragmentation, improved developer tools integration, and higher-level optimization opportunities. However, WasmGC ports require more toolchain effort and may involve compromises in language semantics. The article also highlights the optimization advantages of WasmGC and discusses the use of Binaryen, a Wasm optimizer, to further improve performance.

## 5. [Enable ARMv9 Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) on Pixel 8](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38125379)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses the availability of the ARM Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) on the Pixel 8 hardware (Tensor G3). MTE is a defense mechanism against buffer overflows and use-after-free flaws. The hardware and software support for MTE is available in both Android userspace and the Linux kernel. The article also provides instructions on how to enable MTE in the Android UI and the kernel. MTE can be verified by checking the kernel command line after rebooting.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the enabling of Memory Tagging Extensions (MTE) for user applications. The author mentions that crashes have only been observed in apps that use cgo, such as syncthing and rclone. With root access, it is possible to whitelist apps on a per-app basis by using certain commands. The article includes links to more information on how to implement these whitelists.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests using GrapheneOS instead of stock Android for improved memory tagging extension (MTE) support, as it provides better security and privacy. MTE is integrated into the hardened_malloc feature of GrapheneOS, offering stronger security properties compared to the experimental implementation in stock Pixel OS. MTE detects memory corruption in real-time, with probabilistic detection using 4-bit tags, and deterministic guarantees possible through tag reservation. The article also mentions that enabling MTE for protecting the Linux kernel is not currently recommended, as it is more suited for debugging than hardening.

## 6. [Hyphens, minus, and dashes in Debian man pages](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38121765)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses a recent controversy within the Debian community regarding a change in the groff typesetting program. The change involved the handling of the character used to mark command-line options on Unix systems. The issue revolves around the use of different dashes, such as hyphen, en dash, em dash, and minus sign, which can cause problems in man pages if not used correctly. The groff 1.23.0 release removed the remapping of the hyphen-minus character, exposing glyph usage errors in man pages. Users complained, and the topic sparked a debate among developers. Some argued that all hyphens and minus signs should be unified, while others defended the preservation of distinctions. The article mentions the attempts by the Debian project to address the problem in the past and the reintroduction of the remapping in Debian's version of groff. The article concludes by highlighting the ongoing issues surrounding documentation writing, typographic correctness, and the use of Unicode look-alike code points.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author criticizes the use of hyphens in software documentation, suggesting that simple hyphens should be used instead of special characters. They mention that certain distributions, such as Void, have addressed this issue. The author argues that GNU projects are becoming less relevant due to their approach to this matter. Overall, the article highlights the excessive focus on the "correct hyphen" and its impact on software usage.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a bug on a school website where it only accepts negative numbers entered using the hyphen-minus symbol found on US layout keyboards. This caused confusion for some students who entered the minus symbol based on their keyboard layout or input method editor (IME). The TA had difficulty figuring out the issue initially.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The Android team has decided not to proceed with the development of the Android Verified Boot 2.0 feature. Instead, they will focus on the Android WebView Media Integrity API, which provides a similar form of attestation but only for WebViews within Android apps. This decision has generated mixed reactions, with some expressing concern about the lack of details and skepticism towards the potential security benefits. While it is seen as less harmful than the original proposal, there are questions about whether this could lead to more DRM and enable web apps to act like native apps.
