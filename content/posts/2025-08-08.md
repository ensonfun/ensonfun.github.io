## 10. [Infinite Pixels](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44824056)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The author explores the behavior of CSS when using infinite values for width and height, based on a tweet by Andy P. Testing in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari revealed surprising clamping results: both Chrome and Safari limited the values to around 225-1 (approximately 33 million), while Firefox showed unusual output, such as a computed height of only 19.2px despite infinite input. The inconsistencies in rendering and limits across browsers, particularly with font sizes and line heights, prompted the author to seek explanations for these peculiarities and their origins.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Firefox ignores height declarations exceeding 17,895,697 pixels, the maximum representable number before hitting a 32-bit signed integer limit. Unlike its previous behavior of ignoring such CSS declarations, it now clamps them, except for height. In contrast, WebKit-based browsers utilize a different layout unit, significantly affecting their maximum limits. Internet Explorer previously shared Firefox's behavior but with a much lower cap of 10,737,418 pixels, which posed practical issues for applications like Fastmail when handling large mailboxes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Netscape's layout processing assumed infinite size, causing content to appear only after full loading, while IE4 began with zero size, allowing for quicker rendering as elements loaded. This fundamental difference made IE4 seem faster and highlighted early engineering choices that significantly impacted both companies. Although this challenge was not Netscape's only issue, it emphasized the need for the Gecko layout engine. Some blog narratives by a Microsoft engineer misrepresented Netscape's internal challenges.
