 For seven years, I've operated a solar microgrid on my coffee farm, initially starting with golf cart batteries and four panels. Now, we power four houses, seven cabins, and various systems with 35kW of panels and 160kWh of batteries. We're adding more solar capacity and lithium cells. Our rooftop-mounted panels also help with cooling. While we still use a generator for about 100 hours annually on cloudy days, I'm aiming to switch it to biomass. It's surprising that rural communities still pay for electricity, as it seems economically unfeasible in the Caribbean.
