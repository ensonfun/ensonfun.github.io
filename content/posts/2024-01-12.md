## 1. [Unity's Open-Source Double Standard: The Ban of VLC](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38964972)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The article discusses the integration of the VLC multimedia engine with the Unity game engine, allowing developers to build their own media player using VLC technology in Unity-based games. The article mentions that Unity banned the distribution of VLC assets on their store, even though there are other Unity assets that include LGPL dependencies. As a result, the VLC assets can now be purchased from the Videolabs Store. The article also highlights the services offered by Videolabs, including multimedia consulting packages and the availability of other upcoming products such as Kyber and game engine integration. Additionally, the article mentions that the NuGet VideoLAN account has reached 2 million downloads in the .NET ecosystem and announces the releases of VLC for Unity (UWP) and LibVLCSharp for WinUI.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the author originally created the LGPL (v1) without considering modern concepts like app stores or signed binaries. Since platforms like iOS do not allow users to update libraries, it poses a challenge for deploying LGPL code on those platforms. The article raises the question of whether this is an issue for Unity to address.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests the creation of a lobby or guild to protect projects using LGPL software from being banned by companies like Unity. The guild would initiate lawsuits against these companies based on discrimination laws, making it difficult for them to single out projects. The author argues that if a policy leads to anger and fear, it should be questioned. They also criticize the prioritization of wealth and power over discernment of right and wrong. The author proposes that Unity should abandon policies meant to protect against liability and instead defend projects within its ecosystem against patent, copyright, and trademark trolls. They hope Unity will set an example for other companies in order to reform the system.

## 3. [Removing data transfer fees when moving off Google Cloud](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38953846)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 Google Cloud is offering free network data transfer to customers who want to migrate their data out of Google Cloud and switch to another cloud provider or on-premises system. This move aims to make it easier for customers to change cloud providers; however, it does not address the issue of restrictive and unfair licensing practices. Legacy providers use these practices to create cloud monopolies and lock in customers, limiting competition and choice. Migrating data out of a cloud provider is inexpensive compared to the cost of restrictive licenses. Google Cloud is advocating for the end of these licensing practices to improve customer choice and competition in the cloud market.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a response to the cloud services market investigation conducted by the CMA (Competition and Markets Authority). The investigation highlighted that egress fees create barriers to switching and multi-cloud adoption, thus allowing cloud service providers to maintain their dominance. The article also mentions that software licensing is another area being investigated as part of the CMA's cloud market review.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In this article, it is noted that Google acknowledges that egress fees are excessive. However, they are only eliminating these fees for customers who leave their service. The author argues that if Google truly cared about their customers' best interests, they would reduce these fees for everyone, not just those who are leaving. The author sees this as a performative action rather than a genuine concern for customer satisfaction.

## 4. [Postgres Incremental Backup](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38961463)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses the new feature of incremental backups in Postgres 17. This feature allows users to do full backups at regular intervals and then perform incremental backups that only contain the parts of the data files that have changed. This is more efficient than using the Write Ahead Log (WAL) for point-in-time restores. The article also mentions the WAL summarizer process, which helps determine which parts of the data directory have changed since the last backup. Enabling this feature can greatly improve the speed of restoring to a specific point in time. The article provides a test scenario that shows how incremental backups can significantly reduce the amount of WAL to replay during restore.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article shares their experience with a previous startup where Google Cloud unexpectedly terminated all of their servers and removed access. Although they were able to regain access within an hour, they had to recreate all of their servers. Prior to the incident, the startup was taking daily Postgres base backups to Google Cloud Storage at 2:30 AM. Due to the incident happening at around 3:00 PM, they had to replay the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for approximately 12.5 hours, which was the slowest part and took 6-7 hours to recover the database. As a result of this incident, they started taking base backups every 6 hours.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is bullish on electric vehicles (EVs), but believes that rental cars are not the best place for them currently. EVs are ideal for daily short commutes where charging can be done at home overnight. However, when renting a car, the author finds it challenging since they often drive long distances and are in unfamiliar areas with uncertain charging infrastructure. The author suggests that it may take a couple of decades and advancements in battery and energy technology before EVs are more suitable for rentals. Despite this, the author acknowledges that Hertz's decision to drop Tesla rental cars is due to high repair costs rather than these concerns.

## 6. [Wind turbines are friendlier to birds than oil-and-gas drilling](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38965306)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 A new analysis of American data published in Environmental Science & Technology suggests that wind turbines have negligible effects on bird populations. The study used the Christmas Bird Count, a citizen-science project, and data on bird populations, species maps, and the locations of wind turbines in the United States between 2000 and 2020. The research found that building wind turbines had no discernible impact on bird populations, including large birds such as hawks and eagles. In contrast, oil-and-gas extraction, particularly fracking, led to a 15% drop in bird numbers when new wells were drilled. The study highlights that wind power is not only less damaging to the environment than fossil fuels but also has minimal effects on bird populations. However, media coverage tends to focus on the negative impacts of wind turbines on birds rather than the harmful effects of oil and gas wells.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how bird populations would be better off in a world powered by wind turbines than oil and gas. It highlights that even if no birds were killed by oil drilling, global warming poses an existential threat for two-thirds of North American bird species and a similar proportion of bird species worldwide. It provides a link to further information on the impact of global warming on bird populations.
