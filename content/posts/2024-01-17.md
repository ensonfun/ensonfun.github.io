**Total comment counts : 112**

### Summary

 Apple is making changes to its U.S. iOS App Store policies, allowing developers to direct customers to a non-App Store purchasing option for digital goods. Developers can now feature a single link to their website that leads to an in-app purchase alternative. However, Apple will continue to collect a commission on content bought through these links, ranging from 12 to 27 percent. Developers must apply for a StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement to offer this option. The entitlement allows developers to direct users to an external purchasing mechanism. The update comes as a result of Apple's legal battle with Epic Games and the court's order to change its App Store rules.

## 3. [Fluorite lenses: Corrective capabilities beyond ordinary optical glass](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39020258)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 Canon developed its own technology to create large, high-purity artificial fluorite crystals for use in its camera lenses. The use of fluorite in lenses helps reduce chromatic aberration, resulting in sharp and clear images. Chromatic aberration occurs when different-colored waves within light are refracted at different angles, causing color fringing. Ordinary glass lenses have limitations in correcting chromatic aberration on all wavelengths, but fluorite lenses can effectively correct this issue. Fluorite lenses have low-refractive and low-dispersion properties, especially beneficial for telephoto lenses. Canon's development of artificial fluorite crystals required precise control of temperature and a vacuum environment. The technology was successful, and in 1969, Canon released the FL-F300mm f/5.6, the world's first consumer telephoto lens with fluorite lens elements.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the wavelength dependence of the refractive index of materials and how it affects the magnification and color-shifted images produced by convex lenses. It explains that lenses made from different compositions with varying rates of decreasing indices are used to counteract these effects. It also mentions the significance of Fluorite or CaF2 crystals, which have a flat curve on the wavelength-refractive index plot, allowing them to focus all colors to the same point. The challenge lies in scaling out camera-sized crystals of Calcium and Fluoride with optical clarity. Canon has been working on this for several decades.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains why dispersion matters in the context of apochromatic lenses, which are optimized for three different wavelengths of light. It mentions that calculations for lens designs used to be done by hand but are now done quickly by computers. However, the computer calculations are limited to the properties of the glass elements provided by the glass makers. The article also mentions the special properties of fluorine as a coating for lenses.

## 6. [Willow Protocol](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39026791)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 This article introduces a protocol for peer-to-peer data stores with several key features. These features include fine-grained permissions for privacy, the ability to make destructive edits, and a small bandwidth and memory footprint. The data storage provided by this protocol is always available and can be used for various types of data. Users can have multiple stores for different namespaces, and when stores from different devices belong to the same namespace, they sync with each other. The data stored in this protocol is private and end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that other users cannot access it unless they already know about it and can decrypt it. The protocol also allows for total erasure of data, including metadata. It provides fine-grained capabilities for restricting read and write access to specific data ranges or time periods. Additionally, it supports partial synchronization, allowing users to choose which data to replicate based on various criteria. Destructive edits overwrite old values and metadata, and users can locally delete unwanted data authored by others. The protocol is flexible, allowing users to choose the transport and cryptographic primitives that best suit their needs. Authors can also write from multiple devices concurrently. The project was funded through the NGI Assure Fund, with support from various sponsors.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the design of the Willow data model, which is a protocol that allows for flexibility in choosing certain parameters. These parameters can determine how namespaces are identified, such as through human-readable strings or digital signatures. The goal of Willow is to be a higher-order protocol that can be instantiated with specific choices for its parameters, resulting in a concrete protocol that can be used. However, if two systems instantiate Willow with different parameters, they may not be interoperable even though they both claim to be "Willow-compatible." The article raises the question of whether the purpose of a protocol is to allow independently developed systems to function without agreement on implementation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article compares the Willow protocol to other protocols like IPFS. According to the comparison, data on IPFS is immutable, stateless, and globally-namespaced, while data on Willow is mutable, stateful, and conditionally-namespaced. Willow is described as an authenticated, permissioned, content-based, globally-addressed, distributed database system. The article also mentions a helpful feature in the documentation where hovering over underlined words provides definitions or explanations, making it easier to understand the terminology.

## 10. [ALOHA robot learns from humans to cook, clean, do laundry](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39022996)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 Researchers at Stanford University have developed a new AI system called Mobile ALOHA (A Low-cost Open-source Hardware System for Bimanual Teleoperation) that enables mobile robots to perform complex tasks in various environments. The system addresses the high costs and technical challenges associated with training mobile bimanual robots that require guidance from human operators. Mobile ALOHA is cost-effective, learning from as few as 50 human demonstrations, and costs about $32,000, significantly less than off-the-shelf bimanual robots. The system combines teleoperation and deep imitation learning to enable the robot to learn tasks autonomously after gathering sufficient information. Mobile ALOHA has been successfully demonstrated in tasks such as cooking, house-keeping, and more. However, the system is not suitable for tight spaces. The researchers plan to enhance the system in the future by adding more degrees of freedom.
