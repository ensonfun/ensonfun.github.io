## 2. [Ask for no, don't ask for yes (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43144611)

**Total comment counts : 72**

### Summary

 The article discusses the importance of having a "bias for action," particularly in small company settings where decision-making can be more agile. Here are the key points:

1. **Bias for Action**: The author emphasizes the habit of moving forward even when unsure, which helps break inertia and fosters progress.

2. **Asking for No Instead of Yes**: Rather than seeking permission for actions, the author suggests informing your boss of your intentions with an option for them to veto. This approach minimizes the decision load on the boss while allowing you to proceed with your initiative unless explicitly stopped. An example given is about implementing a new GitHub action to improve software quality.

   - **Example**: Instead of asking for permission to install a new GitHub action, one could say, "I am going to install action X to solve XYZ problems unless I hear differently from you by Monday."

3. **Efficiency in Decision Making**: By setting a deadline for feedback, you encourage quicker responses from superiors or colleagues, reducing delays in project advancement.

4. **Scope and Confidence**: This method is recommended for actions within one's role scope where the individual feels confident but still values potential feedback or oversight.

5. **Newsletter Mention**: The author briefly mentions their newsletter for further reading on related topics like CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management). 

The overall advice is about taking initiative in a way that respects the chain of command but allows for personal and organizational growth through proactive problem-solving.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a strategy for managing delays and non-responsiveness in large companies. The author suggests using a proactive approach in communications by stating an action plan with a deadline. If there's no response within a specified time frame (e.g., "If I don’t hear back from you in [N] days, I am going to do XYZ on [DAY N]"), the sender proceeds with the planned action (XYZ). This method not only prompts a response due to the urgency but also provides a paper trail to show that the sender had previously notified the recipient, thereby avoiding accountability issues when actions are taken without explicit approval.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a communication strategy the author calls "Don’t Ask, Tell," where instead of asking for input or consensus, one makes a decision and informs others about it. The author illustrates this with an example from a personal experience where, instead of asking a group when they would arrive for dinner, he told them a specific time to meet, which streamlined communication and resulted in a successful gathering. This approach, the author argues, leads to more concise and decisive outcomes, minimizing unnecessary back-and-forth communication. The author also links this method to the broader philosophy of "ask for forgiveness, not permission," although acknowledging its risks and inappropriateness in certain collaborative settings like GitHub repositories. The overall message is about the efficiency and effectiveness of taking initiative in communication.

## 3. [In Defense of Text Labels](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43142989)

**Total comment counts : 45**

### Summary

 The article argues that icons in user interfaces often fail to communicate their intended meanings efficiently, leading to increased cognitive load for users. Here are the key points:

1. **Ambiguity of Icons**: Icons like a pencil can be interpreted in various ways (create, edit, write), requiring additional context or cognitive effort to understand their function. This slows down users as they navigate through interfaces.

2. **Increased Complexity with More Features**: As interfaces grow more complex with additional features, distinguishing between similar actions via icons becomes harder, making navigation more difficult.

3. **Contextual Challenges**: Icons can mean different things in different applications or interfaces, leading to confusion and increased mental workload for users who must adapt to these varying visual languages.

4. **Efficiency of Text**: Text labels are more efficient because humans are adept at quickly recognizing and understanding words. Text scanning is simpler than icon interpretation, particularly in lists or mobile interfaces.

5. **Combining Icons with Text**: Using text labels alongside icons reduces ambiguity, speeds up user interaction, and allows for more creative freedom in design. This combination helps in reducing cognitive load, making interfaces more intuitive.

6. **Icons as Visual Anchors**: In applications with a lot of text, icons can serve as visual landmarks to guide users towards interactive elements, enhancing usability when paired with text labels.

The author concludes that while icons can be visually appealing, they often impose an "invisible tax" on user attention and comprehension. Therefore, integrating text labels with icons or even opting for text-only labels in some cases can significantly improve the usability and efficiency of interfaces.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of balance in menu design, particularly with regard to the use of icons:

- **Moderate Use of Icons:** Using some icons in a menu helps by providing anchor points and giving the menu a recognizable structure or "shape."
  
- **Overuse of Icons:** However, when every menu item includes an icon, it can lead to visual overload, making the menu difficult to navigate as all the icons blend together into a blur.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses trends in UI design, noting that despite research from the 1990s showing labels improve user recognition over icons alone, current UI design often omits text. This trend persists despite advancements in display technology that could support clear text rendering. The author criticizes this shift towards icon-only interfaces, attributing it to a focus on design aesthetics and the difficulty of localization, rather than usability. Additionally, even when guidelines like Apple’s iOS human interface guidelines recommend the use of both icons and text for better usability, these are often disregarded by designers who prioritize creative freedom over established usability principles.

## 5. [Vine: A programming language based on Interaction Nets](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43144040)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 **Summary:**

Vine is an experimental programming language that integrates functional and imperative programming paradigms through interaction nets. It's still in heavy development, with ongoing changes expected. Examples of Vine can be found in the vine/examples directory, and those interested can join the Vine Discord server for more information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a programming language that initially resembles Rust but introduces an unusual feature halfway through—interaction nets. The reviewer finds the introduction of this concept confusing because the article does not explain interaction nets or their significance in programming language design early on. The summary critiques the article for not providing context or purpose for the "weirdness," although it acknowledges the value in exploring new programming paradigms.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a function designed to find the minimum value in a list of numbers and then subtract this minimum from each number in the list. Traditionally, this would require two separate loops: one to determine the minimum and another to perform the subtraction. However, the author suggests that by using an "inverse operator," as detailed in a linked document from Vine.dev, it might be possible to merge these operations into a single pass. The author expresses curiosity about whether Vine's system would:

1. **Automatically derive a single-pass algorithm** for this task, or
2. **Execute in two phases**: first in a "forward mode" to find the minimum, followed by a second, implicit pass to adjust all numbers, which would be analogous to a second full pass in an imperative programming context.

The discussion also draws a comparison to programming in early versions of TensorFlow, indicating a similar complexity in operation handling.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the reasons behind the reduction of Ph.D. admissions at universities, particularly in the context of financial uncertainty. Here are the key points:

1. **Financial Uncertainty**: Universities face uncertainty with future research funding (grants), which are not guaranteed even for ongoing projects. This instability affects the universities' ability to commit to new Ph.D. students.

2. **Cost Management**: Since the largest expense on grants is often the salary for trainees (Ph.D. students), universities are cutting back on new admissions to manage costs effectively.

3. **Endowment Limitations**: Most universities, unlike a few with large endowments, do not have sufficient endowment funds to cover ongoing expenses, making them more reliant on grant funding.

4. **Individual Faculty Decisions**: The author, a PI (Principal Investigator) at a state school engineering program, explains that faculty members are also making individual decisions not to admit new students this year. This is to ensure they can fund their current Ph.D. students through the completion of their degrees.

5. **Program and Bottom-Up Decisions**: While the article discusses program-level decisions, there's also a bottom-up approach where faculty directly responsible for funding their students decide to limit or halt new admissions to safeguard financial commitments to existing students.

This situation reflects a broader strategy to manage financial resources conservatively in response to funding unpredictability in academia.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the significant increase in administrative staff at U.S. colleges and universities from 1976 to 2018, outpacing both faculty growth and student enrollment. Here are the key points:

- **Administrative Growth**: The number of full-time administrators and other professionals at these institutions increased by 164% and 452%, respectively, over the 42-year period.
- **Faculty Growth**: In comparison, the number of full-time faculty only grew by 92%, slightly above the 78% increase in student enrollment.
- **Staff-to-Student Ratios**: At the top 50 schools, there is one faculty member for every 11 students, but there is one non-faculty employee for every 4 students. This means there are now three times as many administrators and other professionals as faculty per student at these leading institutions.

The article suggests that this "administrative bloat" is a notable trend, potentially leading to budget cuts in other areas like admissions, rather than reducing administrative overhead.

2. **Research Efforts**: The author shares their past research where they aimed to develop a sensor system that could algorithmically adjust for sensor degradation. They explored using nanoporous platinum electrodes, which were considered cutting-edge at the time, but ultimately simplified their approach to using cached data for sensor calibration.

3. **Innovative Uses**: There's mention of an experiment where blood glucose was used to generate electricity in a fuel cell setup, demonstrating a potential dual use of glucose for both energy and sensor functionality.

4. **Reflection on Progress**: The author reflects on the slow progress in sensor technology compared to other tech fields, expressing a mix of satisfaction with current commercial solutions and disappointment at the pace of innovation in this area. 

Overall, the text highlights the challenges in sensor technology due to biological material degradation, the exploration of alternative materials and methods, and a personal reflection on the evolution of the field over two decades.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the lifespan of glucose sensors, like those used in continuous glucose monitoring systems, is primarily limited by the body's immune response to the sensor. This response includes attacks by immune cells, inflammation, and the formation of fibrotic scar tissue around the sensor. Such reactions reduce the amount of glucose that can reach the sensor, eventually making it less accurate or insufficient for use. The typical advertised lifespan for these sensors is around 12-15 days, supported by a study where 77.9% of sensors lasted the full 15 days, indicating that about 20% might not last that long, and 10% could fail before reaching 12 days.

## 10. [Clang Static Analyzer and the Z3 constraint solver (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43145106)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 The article discusses the importance of minimizing false positives in static analyzers, highlighting Coverity's success in this area. It then focuses on LLVM's integration with the Z3 constraint solver through the `LLVM_ENABLE_Z3_SOLVER` build option, which is available but not enabled by default in some Linux distributions like Fedora 36 and Ubuntu 22.04, but is enabled in Debian 11. The author has added this option to the llvm and clang packages in Pkgsrc for NetBSD users. The article explains two methods of using Z3 with Clang Static Analyzer:

1. **Using Z3 as an external solver**, which significantly slows down the analysis but can be thorough.
2. **Using Z3 for refutation** to filter out false positives alongside the default solver, which is much faster.

A demonstration using a small code snippet shows that without Z3, the analyzer reports a false positive due to limitations in reasoning about certain operations, whereas with Z3, no bugs are detected, showcasing its effectiveness in reducing false positives.
