## 1. [How many photons are received per bit transmitted from Voyager 1?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40561872)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article discusses the number of photons transmitted and received per bit by Voyager 1 when it sends messages to Earth. Option A states that Voyager sends 160 bits/second with 23W, resulting in approximately 4 x 10^24 photons per second or 2.6 x 10^22 per bit. Option B mentions that the receiver with a 70m dish will collect only 1.3 attowatt (1.3 x 10^-18 W), which corresponds to around 240,000 photons per second or 1500 photons per bit. Option C highlights the number of photons per bit needed and suggests that with only thermal noise, we would require around 7.5 photons at 8.3 GHz. However, additional atmospheric noise and circuit noise may increase the requirement to around 25 photons per bit at 8.3 GHz or 91 photons at 2.3 GHz. Overall, there is not much margin for photon transmission.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article works in the field of quantum error correction and wants to find examples of repetition codes being used in classical systems. They mention examples such as DRAM storing data through the presence or absence of electrons, undersea cables sending photons per bit, and transistor switching numbers. The author explains that protecting a qubit in quantum computing requires special physical properties or complex error correction strategies, while contrasting it with the sizes of implicit repetition codes used in classical computing. The article includes links to references for further reading.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the limit predicted by Shannon can be surpassed by using photon counting receivers and PPM formats. Shannon's limit assumes gaussian noise, but with photon counting receivers, a poisson distribution is needed. The Gordon-Holevo limit is introduced as a way to go beyond Shannon's limit. The article also mentions that using optics can achieve even better results, with examples of achieving 1 photon/bit at 10 Gbit/s. A link to a specific study on the topic is provided.

## 2. [Making USB devices â€“ end to end guide to your first gadget](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40560300)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 This article provides an introduction to building USB devices, explaining the basics of USB technology and the physical connections involved.

## 4. [Lowering resource usage with foot and systemd](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40557770)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with configuring their terminal (foot) in the sway window manager. They explain how they used custom systemd targets to manage long-running processes like their terminal server and how they solved issues with scratchpad configurations and applying theme changes. The author decided to switch to a real service manager (systemd) to abstract the configuration and offload process management. They provide the necessary commands and configurations for setting up systemd services for the main and helper scratchpads, as well as the foot server and clients. The article concludes by highlighting the benefits of this setup, including improved memory consumption and easier configuration updates.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 6. [I'm forking Ladybird and stepping down as SerenityOS BDFL](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40560768)

**Total comment counts : 38**

### Summary

 The article discusses the decision to fork off the Ladybird project from the SerenityOS operating system into a separate top-level project. The author explains that they have been primarily focused on Ladybird for the past two years and have now decided to streamline its development by separating it from SerenityOS. The author expresses love for SerenityOS and its community but believes that this change will lead to a better future for both projects. Ladybird development will now happen in a new repository on GitHub, with day-to-day communication moving to a new Ladybird Discord server. The project will now target Linux and macOS, dropping the SerenityOS target. The article emphasizes that there is no drama behind this decision but rather a recognition that the two projects have been packed uncomfortably into a single space for too long. The author expresses gratitude to everyone who has worked on these projects and is excited about the future of both projects now that they can focus better on their main interests.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Andreas, a skilled coder and community builder. It suggests that Andreas may be more passionate about browser hacking than operating system hacking. The split between his contributions to Ladybird (a cross-platform browser) and SerenityOS (a toy operating system) is mentioned. SerenityOS is described as a project focused on writing code from scratch and proving its feasibility, rather than producing a revolutionary operating system. The main concern is moving as much code as possible from Ladybird to SerenityOS.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that Ladybird, a software program, is now targeting Linux and macOS operating systems, while discontinuing support for SerenityOS. The reasons behind dropping SerenityOS as a target are not provided in the article. It is unclear if Ladybird for SerenityOS will need to continuously adopt patches from the new Ladybird project in order to continue development. The article also raises questions about whether it is still considered a fork if the new project retains the name "Ladybird." It wonders if SerenityOS's browser will require a new name or if there will be two separate Ladybird projects with the same name, suggesting a potential qualifier to differentiate them.

## 9. [The Intellectual Obesity Crisis (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40558754)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 The article discusses how the abundance of information in the digital age has led to an epidemic of intellectual obesity. It compares information to sugar, stating that our brains treat information as a reward and crave it regardless of its accuracy or usefulness. This has resulted in a rise of low-quality "junk info" that is addictive and potentially dangerous. The article explains that junk info is information that has no practical use and doesn't improve our understanding. Examples include gossip, trivia, clickbait, and sensationalist stories. Market forces and social pressures have caused junk info to dominate the web because it is cheap and good at stealing attention. Despite being empty calories, junk info still gives the satisfaction of mental nourishment. However, consuming junk info can lead to a decrease in awareness and the ability to process information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the brain treats information as a reward, regardless of its accuracy or usefulness. However, the user disagrees, stating that different people are attracted to different types of information because their brains classify it as useful and reward them for engaging with it. They give an example of TikTok, which they find irritating but others find useful. The user suggests that the problem lies in people misclassifying information as useful when it isn't, comparing it to sweeteners that don't provide calories but still reward the taste buds. They argue that this behavior leads people to consume artificial information excessively and neglect real useful information.
