**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 In this article, Filipe Cruz, a long-time member of the demoscene community, discusses what the demoscene is and how it has evolved over the years. The demoscene is a subculture of digital art and is focused on showcasing audiovisual presentations called demos. It originated from the game piracy scene of the late 80s and early 90s and has grown into an international community that regularly releases new demoscene productions and organizes demoparties. The demoscene is driven by a combination of artistic expression and pushing the limitations of computer hardware. Demo creators often work in teams, but there are also individual artists in the demoscene. Demoscene productions are typically shared at demoparties, where competitions are held to showcase the best demos. The demoscene has recently been recognized as intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in some countries. Filipe Cruz runs a YouTube channel dedicated to demoscene culture, where he shares information, highlights, and discussions about the demoscene. For those interested in getting involved in the demoscene, Filipe recommends his guidebook, "Teach Yourself Demoscene in 14 Days," as well as other online resources and demoscene events listed on platforms like Demozoo and Demoparty.net.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The characteristic sound of psy-x is the synth bass line, which can be created using any subtractive synth. The sound is achieved by starting with a single saw, adding a lowpass filter, and modulating the cutoff of the filter by an envelope with a short attack, quick decay, and low or zero sustain. Alternatively, a stepper or LFO synced to 16th notes can be used. Sidechain compression with the kick is also employed to create a pumping sound. These techniques create the deep vibe of a psy track that resonates in the club at 2am. Beyond the basics, more advanced tracks may modulate the decay of the filter envelope with note velocity, add velocity curves to create dynamics, or employ other effects like reverb, FM synthesis, overdrive, or frequency shift. Despite its simplicity, the synth bass line can be driven to create unique and unusual sounds.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses disappointment that a certain solution is built on top of UDP/IP instead of directly over Ethernet. They have been working with Ethernet devices and find the complexity unnecessary, such as ARP, DHCP, and DNS. They believe that addressing could be done more efficiently at Layer 2, as they already know all the devices on their LAN and their MAC addresses. However, the current setup requires mapping devices to IP addresses and vice versa, which the author finds unsatisfying.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the similarities between the problems being solved with fibre channel (FC) and the attempts to solve them with new technologies. It mentions that FC routes IP as one of its protocols and provides better service guarantees than ethernet. However, FC never gained popularity as an IP transport due to its high cost. The article also mentions NVMEoF on FC as a solution for network performance issues. The author questions why the Open Compute Project (OCP) doesn't build affordable FC adapters and sell them on the open market.

## 6. [Hacker leaks millions more 23andMe user records on cybercrime forum](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37931383)

**Total comment counts : 43**

### Summary

 The same hacker who previously leaked user data from 23andMe has now released millions of new user records. The hacker, known as Golem, published the dataset on the cybercrime forum BreachForums. Some of the newly leaked data matches known 23andMe user and genetic information. The dataset is said to contain information on people from Great Britain, including wealthy individuals from the US and Western Europe. 23andMe is reviewing the data to determine its legitimacy. The previous data breach occurred on October 6, with hackers using credential stuffing to amass stolen data. 23andMe has urged users to change their passwords and activate multi-factor authentication. It is still unclear how much data was stolen, the hackers' methods, and their intentions. The incident may have occurred several months ago, as a hacker on another forum advertised 23andMe user data in August, which matched some of the recently leaked records. The full extent of the data leak and the information known by 23andMe remain unknown.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the recent incident involving 23andMe, a genetic testing company, and the blaming of its customers for reusing passwords. The company's "DNA Relatives" feature, which allows users to see the data of other users with matching genetic data, was also blamed for the incident. The article argues that 23andMe's blame is an obfuscation of the underlying problems. These problems include insufficient granularity in sharing options within the DNA Relatives program, a limit of seeing only the closest 1500 matches, and the possibility of seeing profiles beyond the 1500 match limit. The article suggests that these issues allowed hackers to collect data on a large number of people in the database with only a few compromised accounts.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author regrets using 23andMe before prioritizing privacy. They no longer trust that the company would delete their data upon request, and they worry that their data may be used for research purposes without their consent. They feel uneasy about the idea of their genetic data being leaked, unlike credit card or shopping data. Additionally, they suspect that they may not have implemented proper password security at the time of using 23andMe.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article speculates about why USB-C cables have all 24 pins, even though not all of them are connected. It suggests that the extra pins may help the plug fit securely in its socket, or that it may be cheaper to maintain one design for cables produced by the same factory. The article also explains that manufacturers often buy connectors, PCBs, cables, and plastic moldings from different vendors, and then assemble them together. This assembly process can be relatively simple and may involve a small warehouse and a few workers. Additionally, the article mentions that most off-the-shelf USB-C connectors have all their pins populated because pins are inexpensive, and it only makes sense to request custom connectors with missing pins when producing a large volume.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the need for USB-C cables that are properly tested, labeled, and available in the market. The author mentions their own experience with a USB-C cable from a Kickstarter campaign, where they had to test and label each new cable they bought. They note that most cables on shopping websites are USB 2.0 and finding cables with power delivery pins is difficult. The author suggests that it should be mandatory for these cables to be accurately specified and labeled.
