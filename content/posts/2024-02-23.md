**Total comment counts : 75**

### Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experiences with phishing attacks disguised as parcel delivery messages. They mention receiving a suspicious SMS and sought the opinion of others on its legitimacy. The majority considered the message to be "dodgy AF" based on various signs. Despite their skepticism, the author was actually expecting a package from FedEx and wanted to verify the message. They found that the link in the SMS allowed users to manipulate the tracking number and other details. The author also noticed inconsistencies in the link and questioned its authenticity. They decided to call FedEx directly to confirm, but the response they received was not helpful. The article highlights the confusion and concern surrounding these messages and encourages caution when encountering similar situations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses issues with FedEx's digital platform, suggesting that it may be the worst and least secure among major companies. The author shares two examples of problems they encountered. Firstly, they were able to access the previous tenant's delivery instructions and the building's private garage code without any verification when setting up FedEx Delivery Manager. This lack of security could easily be exploited by thieves. Secondly, when the author tried to add their new address to the delivery manager after moving out, the site consistently errored. It was discovered that special characters in the password caused parts of the site, including the change password flow, to be permanently broken. Consequently, the author had to create a new account with a weaker password. These instances highlight significant vulnerabilities in FedEx's digital platform, which appear to be unprofessional for such a reputable company.

## 7. [A Distributed File System in Go Cut Average Metadata Memory Usage to 100 Bytes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39476002)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 JuiceFS is a cloud-native distributed file system written in Go that can manage tens of billions of files in a single namespace. It achieves remarkable memory optimization by using an all-in-memory approach for its metadata engine, reducing memory usage by 90%. The metadata engine is designed for ultimate performance, using real-time transaction logs and the Raft consensus algorithm for replication and failover. To improve efficiency, JuiceFS uses a lock-free mode similar to Redis, where core data structure operations are executed in a single thread. It achieves horizontal scaling by distributing metadata across multiple nodes in virtual partitions, allowing for larger data scales and higher performance. JuiceFS also implements a dynamic subtree splitting mechanism to minimize metadata operations within a single partition, reducing the need for distributed transactions. Reducing metadata memory usage is crucial for system stability and cost control.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of integrity in managing a large number of files using JuiceFS, a file system written in Go. The author emphasizes the need for a robust integrity feature, such as having a cryptographic hash of the contents of each file. They suggest making this hash part of the inventory and allowing the entire file system to opt in to mandatory hashing. The article notes that even popular systems like S3 have limited support for this feature, while some competitors have no support at all.
