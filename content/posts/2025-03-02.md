## 1. [The early days of Linux (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43225686)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 Lars Wirzenius recounts his experiences during the early development of Linux, starting from his university days at the University of Helsinki where he met Linus Torvalds in 1988. They both became fascinated with Unix after gaining access to a Unix server and exploring Usenet. After returning from military service in 1990, they delved deeper into Unix and other operating systems, discussing how an ideal OS should be constructed.

Linus bought his first PC in January 1991 to experiment with multitasking, equipped with a 386 CPU, 4MB RAM, and a hard drive. Initially, he played games like Prince of Persia but soon started developing what would become the Linux kernel, beginning with a simple multitasking demo in assembly. Lars contributed by implementing the `sprintf()` function for Linus, which is still part of the kernel today.

By late spring, Linus had expanded his kernel to include basic functionalities like keyboard and serial port drivers, and VT100 terminal emulation, allowing him to connect to the university from home. A humorous mishap occurred when Linus tried to use his hard drive to dial the university, leading to a corrupted master boot sector.

In August 1991, Linus publicly introduced his kernel on the comp.os.minix newsgroup, initially calling it Freax, though it was soon renamed Linux by an FTP administrator. This was the beginning of Linux's journey from a personal project to a globally recognized operating system. The first installation of Linux happened on Lars's PC while he napped, marking a light-hearted milestone in Linux history.

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 The article discusses a significant discovery by the Euclid space mission, which aims to map the Dark Universe by studying gravitational lensing. Gravitational lensing occurs when massive celestial bodies, like galaxies, bend the light from objects behind them, creating distorted or multiple images of these background objects. This phenomenon, first theorized by Einstein, allows astronomers to study distant galaxies and the effects of dark matter.

Euclid has identified a rare occurrence of gravitational lensing in the galaxy NGC 6505, which is relatively close at about 590 million light-years away. This galaxy has produced a perfect Einstein Ring, an extremely rare visual effect where light from a distant galaxy, located about 4.5 billion light-years away, forms a complete ring around NGC 6505 due to perfect alignment with Earth. This event is particularly notable because:

- **Rarity**: Gravitational lenses, especially those forming Einstein Rings, are not common. The chances of such alignments are statistically very low, especially for nearby galaxies.
- **Significance**: This discovery not only showcases the capabilities of the Euclid mission, which expects to increase the known number of gravitational lenses dramatically, but also provides a unique opportunity to study gravitational effects in detail.

The article highlights how Euclid's high-resolution imaging capabilities allowed for this observation, which was further confirmed by follow-up spectroscopy with the Keck telescope. This finding underscores the potential of Euclid's mission to revolutionize our understanding of the universe's structure and the distribution of dark matter.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 8. [Abusing C to implement JSON parsing with struct methods](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43222344)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article discusses personal practices and preferences for managing C projects using `make` and `gcc` with specific flags, although it notes these practices might not be universally applicable due to tool versions and personal coding style. Here's a summary:

1. **Makefile Usage**: The author uses `make` mainly as a command runner, not defining typical targets like `.PHONY` since they do not use a separate build directory. They locate source and header files in the same directory as the makefile using `find`.

2. **C Programming Practices**:
   - **Stringification**: Uses `#<expression>` for stringification of C expressions.
   - **JSON Handling**: Discusses the creation of a JSON parser in C:
     - Defines an enum `json_type` to represent different JSON types (boolean, string, number, etc.).
     - Uses a `json_value` struct to hold parsed JSON values, with fields for type, value (using a union), and management of child elements for arrays and objects.
     - Memory management for JSON structures is handled by `json_free_value`, which frees heap-allocated parts of the JSON structure.

3. **Code Techniques**:
   - **Method-like Structures**: Simulates object-oriented programming by attaching function pointers to structures.
   - **Error Handling**: Utilizes a simple assertion macro `ASSERT` to manage errors, like checking for null pointers.
   - **Parser Simplification**: Combines lexer and parser into one, ignoring whitespace with `skip_whitespace`. Parses JSON atoms (null, true, false, numbers, strings) and handles arrays and objects.

4. **Miscellaneous**:
   - The author uses `gcc` version 14.2.1 and provides specifics on how they compile and manage their C projects, emphasizing simplicity over optimization.

This summary encapsulates the author's approach to C programming, focusing on JSON parsing, makefile configuration, and some coding practices tailored to personal efficiency rather than widespread applicability.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of function pointers in C programming. The author expresses confusion over why attaching function pointers to structs would be considered abusive or problematic. They mention having used this technique in production environments years ago without issue, highlighting that function pointers are a valuable feature of C. The author contrasts this with another C feature, GCC's `goto *ptr`, suggesting it has more potential for misuse.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article critiques a method of implementing virtual tables (vtables) in C using structs, particularly in the context of parsing JSON:

1. **Usefulness of Vtables**: The author argues that using structs for vtables in this case lacks purpose since it doesn't facilitate dynamic dispatch or flexibility needed for different file formats like XML, leading to more verbose and less performant code.

2. **Complexity in Memory Management**: The code example is criticized for excessive use of `malloc` and `free`, which complicates memory management unnecessarily. The author suggests that a simpler approach like using a bump allocator could drastically simplify the code, removing the need for complex tracking of stack vs. heap allocations.

3. **Misconceptions About JSON Parsing**: The article points out that the claim of JSON being difficult to parse is misleading, as JSON's simplicity was a key to its adoption. The real issues with JSON are related to semantics, not parsing complexity.

4. **Code Structure**: The JSON parser mixes data provision and parsing logic, which adds unnecessary complexity. The author recommends separating these responsibilities for better design.

5. **Error Handling and EOF Management**: The parser's handling of EOF and error conditions is criticized, especially in non-debug builds where errors might not be properly managed.

6. **String Handling**: The use of null-terminated strings is discouraged in favor of string slices for better efficiency and readability.

Overall, the critique suggests that the approach taken in the article for teaching or implementing JSON parsing in C is flawed and not representative of professional C programming practices. It recommends alternative methods and tools that would make the code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to understand.

## 10. [Reimagining Fluid Typography](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43205968)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article by Miriam Suzanne, published on February 12, 2025, discusses the challenges and considerations of implementing user preferences for text sizing on websites. Here are the key points:

1. **Best Practices in Typography**: Using relative units like `em` and `rem` for text sizing has been standard to allow text to scale according to user settings. This ensures that text size respects the user's default browser settings.

2. **Fluid Typography**: The introduction of fluid typography involves using viewport or container relative units (`vi`, `cqi`) alongside `em` or `rem` to create responsive text sizing that adjusts based on the screen size or container, with `clamp()` functions setting boundaries for font scaling.

3. **Utopia's Approach**: A common method involves starting with pixel values for font sizes and converting them to `rem`, assuming 1rem equals 16px. This approach, while useful, relies on assumptions that might not hold true in all scenarios, leading to potential inconsistencies in text size across different devices and user settings.

4. **User Experience Issues**: Miriam highlights a personal experience where setting a larger default font size in the browser resulted in excessively large text on her site, which was already designed with larger text in mind. This illustrates a common issue where user preferences can lead to unintended scaling of text.

5. **Browser Settings and Preferences**: Recent changes in Chromium browsers allow for selecting from preset text sizes rather than exact pixel values, aiming to simplify user control over web text size but potentially complicating precise control over text scaling.

6. **Accessibility and Design Considerations**: The article raises concerns about how fluid typography and user preferences can lead to accessibility issues if not implemented thoughtfully. It suggests that there might be a need for more nuanced approaches in how websites interpret and apply user font size preferences to avoid making text too large or too small relative to the intended design.

7. **Conclusion**: The overarching theme is the need for web developers to rethink how they implement user preferences to ensure these settings enhance accessibility without compromising the design integrity or user experience. The article encourages exploring better methods to harmonize user settings with web design practices.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes the typography choices of a website, focusing on its overly large font sizes which are set using fluid typography (`font-size: calc(1.25em + .5vw)`). Here are the key points:

1. **Font Size Critique**: The font size is deemed excessively large across different devices. On a 1920×1080 display, the font is calculated to be about 29.6px, which is 30-70% larger than typical web text sizes. On mobile devices with a 400px width, it's about 22px, still 20-30% too large.

2. **User Experience**: The author had to zoom out to 50% to make the text readable, which is unusual and indicates a poor design choice. The fluid typography affects how browser zoom functions, causing disorientation when navigating through the document.

3. **Content vs. Presentation**: While the content of the article itself provides valuable insights, particularly on the common mistake of assuming a fixed browser em size, its presentation undermines its credibility due to the poor typography choices.

4. **Technical Shortcoming**: The site does not use a `clamp()` function to limit the font size extremes, which could have mitigated some of the issues with the oversized text.

Overall, the article highlights the pitfalls of fluid typography when not properly constrained or considered in context with user expectations and device diversity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests enhancing a demo by adjusting sliders beyond a certain limit and changing the event handling from 'change' to 'input' for a smoother, real-time interaction experience.
