### Summary

 This article tells the story of how canned coffee became a multi-billion dollar business in Japan. It all started in 1969 when the CEO of UCC Coffee, Tadao Ueshima, wanted a way to buy and carry his coffee with him. He assembled a team to create a coffee that could be sold in steel cans. They faced numerous challenges, but eventually succeeded in producing the first mass-produced canned coffee. At first, people were skeptical of drinking coffee from a can, but UCC found success by targeting the 1970 Osaka World Fair. This led to a surge in demand for canned coffee. Another company, Pokka Lemon, later introduced the first canned hot coffee in 1973. Coca Cola and Suntory also entered the market, with Coca Cola's Georgia brand becoming the best-selling product in Japan. The success of canned coffee relied on the combination of cans and vending machines, and these elements played a crucial role in its popularity.

## 5. [ZF makes magnet-free electric motor uniquely compact and competitive](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37453465)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 Automotive technology company ZF has developed an electric motor that does not require magnets. The motor, called I2SM (In-Rotor Inductive-Excited Synchronous Motor), transmits the energy for the magnetic field via an inductive exciter inside the rotor shaft, making it compact yet powerful and efficient. Unlike permanent-magnet synchronous machines (PSM) commonly used in electric vehicles, the I2SM does not rely on magnets that require rare earth materials for production. This makes the motor more sustainable, secure, and efficient. The technology reduces losses and the CO2 footprint in production by up to 50%. ZF plans to further develop the I2SM for production and offer it as an option in its e-drive platform.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a new type of motor called a magnet-less separately excited synchronous motor (I2SM). The motor is claimed to be up to 90mm more compact axially and does not use slip rings and brushes. Instead, power is transferred to the rotor via induction coils. This eliminates the need for brushes and seals, allowing the motor to be oil cooled from the inside. However, there are concerns about the power losses incurred by transferring energy to the rotor via induction compared to the previous direct contact method. The article also mentions that the coils in the motor appear to be spaced far apart.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses different types of motors with permanent magnets. The most common type is the synchronous motor, where the power supply needed for the rotor windings is replaced by permanent magnets. However, in order to achieve the same brushless operation, the rotor windings are kept, but the electrical current needed is transmitted to the rotor wirelessly. This method involves the use of semiconductor rectifiers and inducing the rotor current at a higher frequency than the rotation frequency. While this setup has similarities to permanent magnet motors, the energy efficiency is unclear if it can be equally good. A permanent magnet rotor is comparable to a rotor with superconducting windings, which means it has no losses due to electrical excitation currents. However, this wireless rotor setup will have additional losses in the copper windings and rectifiers used. Despite these extra losses, the efficiency of this motor can potentially be much higher than that of asynchronous motors and slightly lower than that of permanent magnet motors.
