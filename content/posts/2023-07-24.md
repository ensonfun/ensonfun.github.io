**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article discusses a vulnerability discovered by Tavis Ormandy from Google Information Security. The vulnerability affects all Zen 2 class processors and allows attackers to spy on operations, such as strlen, memcpy, and strcmp, that use vector registers. The vulnerability is triggered by utilizing the XMM Register Merge Optimization, a register rename, and a mispredicted vzeroupper instruction. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can monitor encryption keys and passwords as users log in. The article also mentions a software workaround and a microcode update released by AMD to address the vulnerability.

## 10. [Teach your LLM to answer with facts, not fiction](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36840728)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems that can answer questions, but they may provide inaccurate responses on unfamiliar topics, a phenomenon known as hallucination. To improve the accuracy of LLMs, it is recommended to provide facts and definitions related to the question. Adding supporting documents and using vector searches can also help retrieve relevant information. Vector SQL, an extended version of SQL, is a powerful tool for constructing complex search queries in LLMs. By integrating vector searches with SQL, users can improve the performance of LLMs on complex topics. The article provides examples and tips for designing prompts and using vector SQL effectively. The use of external knowledge and vector SQL can help reduce hallucination and enhance the performance of LLMs.
