**Total comment counts : 41**

### Summary

 A U.K. woman named Tessa Coates was photographed in a mirror with reflections that didn't match. However, this was not a glitch in the Matrix but rather a mistake in Apple's computational photography pipeline. When the photo was taken, Coates was moving, resulting in different images being captured. Apple's algorithm stitched these photos together, resulting in three different versions of Coates in the image. This phenomenon can be recreated on recent iPhones and smartphones when taking photos near mirrors. Younger generations have discovered this and used it to create silly images for social media.
