## 10. [How to avoid P hacking](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43934682)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 P hacking is the manipulation of data or analysis to achieve statistically significant results, often leading to unreliable scientific conclusions. Common practices include stopping experiments early upon finding significant results, selectively reporting only favorable outcomes, and repeating experiments until a desired result is obtained. This behavior, often unintentional, exacerbates the reproducibility crisis in research. To combat P hacking, researchers should predefine their sample sizes and analysis methods and report all outcomes, including those that do not support their hypotheses. Transparency in research promotes scientific integrity and progress.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on their experience with "p-hacking," initiated by a push to extract significant results from old datasets using new statistical methods. Despite recognizing the dubious nature of these practices, they highlight the excitement of uncovering appealing effects. However, instead of validating these findings with new experiments, they were encouraged to publish the results, reinforcing the problematic nature of prioritizing publishable outcomes over scientific integrity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article critiques the idea that stopping an experiment after finding a significant effect before reaching a predetermined sample size is P hacking. It emphasizes that clinical trials often end early for valid reasons, such as demonstrating significant benefits or futility, thus saving time and resources. A notable instance occurred with circumcision trials that showed substantial benefits and ended early. In experimental studies, early evidence of efficacy typically leads to repeating the experiment rather than concluding it prematurely, reinforcing the need for robust replication.
