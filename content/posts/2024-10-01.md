## 2. [Comedy Theory (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41669691)

**Total comment counts : 41**

### Summary

 The article presents a theory on how comedy functions, emphasizing a structured approach to creating jokes and comedy sketches. It explains that our brains recognize patterns and make predictions based on them. Jokes consist of a setup that leads to pattern recognition and a punchline that defies expectations by introducing an unexpected association. This unexpected connection relies on a "Common Aspect," which links two unrelated patterns through a shared interpretation, creating an "absurd association."

To craft a joke, one needs to identify two patterns connected by a common aspect and then construct a setup and punchline. The humor increases with the distance between the patterns (the more absurd the juxtaposition) and the strength of the connection through the common aspect. The article also illustrates the process of identifying aspects of a pattern and how to find surprising associations between unrelated ideas.

Finally, once a humorous concept is developed, it can be adapted into various formats, like stand-up or sketches. The author invites feedback and further engagement with readers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article critiques the simplification of comedy as merely jokes, arguing that this viewpoint overlooks the diversity and depth of comedic expression.
