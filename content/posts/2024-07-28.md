**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges faced by engineers in designing batteries for electric vehicles. It highlights the trade-off between high energy and high power batteries and the various constraints such as safety, lifetime, weight, and cost. The use of simulation is recommended to debug batteries and optimize their performance. The article also mentions the difficulties faced by engineers in testing different battery designs and the cost associated with it. Overall, the article emphasizes the complexities and considerations involved in battery design.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes that conducting one-factor-at-a-time testing is an inefficient approach in experimental design. It suggests that a better method is to use modern experimental design methods such as sequential design and response surface design or GP model surrogate. These methods can optimize the response with fewer runs, potentially in the range of hundreds or thousands. The author recommends reading "Design and Analysis of Experiments" by Douglas C. Montgomery as a textbook on industrial experimentation.

## 2. [How did Facebook intercept their competitor's encrypted mobile app traffic?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41090304)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 Facebook is facing a class action lawsuit that alleges the company intercepted encrypted traffic from users' devices through the Onavo Protect app in order to gain competitive insights. The analysis is based on court documents and reverse engineering of the app. Facebook reportedly used a transparent proxy feature in the Squid caching proxy software called "ssl bump" to intercept specific domains belonging to Snapchat, YouTube, and Amazon. It is unclear if other user traffic was intercepted. Facebook's use of a transparent TLS proxy became less successful over time due to improved security controls in Android. The company also considered using the Accessibility API as an alternative. Facebook planned to rebrand and distribute the technology used in the Onavo Protect app. The app collected usage telemetry from iPhones and more detailed statistics from Android devices. Facebook aimed to intercept encrypted traffic to competitor's analytics domains to obtain data on in-app actions by getting users to install a custom certificate on their devices. However, Google has made it difficult to install a trusted certificate in most applications on Android. In Android 11, it is not possible to prompt users to install a certificate, making Facebook's interception technique technically impossible. The legality of Facebook's actions is in question.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In this article, the author clarifies that Facebook allegedly paid users to participate in "market research" and install a proxy. They point out that the installation doesn't seem to be a hack and suggests that participants were likely aware that their actions were being monitored. The author also questions whether it can be considered wiretapping if one party breaks encryption using a third-party tool. They further ponder if using a local SSL proxy to decrypt and analyze traffic to a service's API would also be considered wiretapping.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes the actions of people at Facebook for openly discussing the use of MITM (man-in-the-middle) and getting other companies to include this kit in their products. The author describes the actions as stupid and arrogant, questioning whether these people have never seen a movie or read news articles about other companies getting caught in similar situations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the power of consumer grade cards in 2024, highlighting the achievement of achieving 60fps with a Resnet + 16 layers model. While it is not as advanced as GPT4, it is still a significant accomplishment.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a technique that uses neural networks to encode and decode fabric patterns. The researchers found that fabric patterns are often regular and repetitive, allowing them to leverage this in their approach. The technique involves encoding fabric patterns as a small vector and then decoding it to create realistic fabric representations. The gain in performance is likely due to the ability to compress and decompress the fabric patterns, as well as potential work that can be done in the reduced space.

## 4. [The irrational hungry judge effect revisited (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41091803)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article discusses a study conducted by Danziger, Levav, and Avnaim-Pesso in 2011, which analyzed legal rulings of Israeli parole boards. The study found that the probability of a favorable decision decreased from 65% to almost 0% from the first ruling to the last ruling within each session. However, the rate of favorable rulings returned to 65% in a session following a food break. The authors argue that these findings suggest extraneous factors, possibly mental depletion, influence judicial decisions. A simulation suggests that the observed influence of order can be explained by the length of favorable rulings. The article also highlights that individuals in various contexts are influenced by irrelevant factors in decision-making. It is socially desirable for legal cases to be based solely on the law and relevant facts, but it has been shown that judges exhibit biases similar to other individuals. The prevailing descriptive models in psychology and legal literature recognize that legal decision-making is not purely rational and can be influenced by irrelevant factors. In summary, the article concludes that there is clear evidence that judicial decision-making is influenced by extraneous factors, which is consistent with prevailing theories in law and psychology.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The original studies on decision-making by judges were deemed faulty because they did not consider the order in which the cases were presented. The cases were arranged in such a way that less severe cases were seen first, followed by more severe cases. Critics argue that this order was not random and had an impact on the decisions made. Specifically, cases from one prison were addressed before a break, and then cases from the next prison were taken up. In addition, requests from prisoners without legal representation were typically handled at the end of each session, making them less likely to receive favorable decisions compared to those represented by lawyers. Furthermore, lawyers representing multiple inmates likely had control over the order in which cases were presented, potentially starting with the strongest cases.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a study that challenges the findings of a previous study regarding the behavior of judges. The original study suggested that judges were more lenient after lunch and harsher right before a break. However, this new study argues that positive rulings actually take longer, and judges tend to handle simpler negative rulings before a break. The research provides a more nuanced understanding of judges' decision-making process, contradicting the oversimplified interpretation from the original study.

## 6. [A Userâ€™s Guide to Statistical Inference and Regression](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41072691)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 This article is about a book that aims to teach readers statistics. Statistics is the field that describes how we learn about the world using quantitative data. In the social sciences, statistical methods are increasingly used to provide evidence for conceptual arguments. Understanding statistics is important for conducting quantitative research and making methodological choices. The book focuses on two key goals: understanding ways to assess estimators and applying these ideas to the estimation of regression models. It introduces the basics of statistical inference, including concepts such as bias, sampling variance, consistency, and asymptotic normality. The book also discusses model-based inference and asymptotic analysis. It concludes with a chapter on hypothesis testing. The book aims to provide a high level of mathematical sophistication and correct the lack of relevant texts in other social sciences.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of quantitative analysis in social data. It explains that while quantitative analysis allows for precise estimates, its true advantage lies in the ability to communicate methodological goals, assumptions, and results clearly. The article criticizes the lack of clarity and assumptions made in the field of "data science" and suggests that understanding the limitations of models is crucial.
