## 5. [A Review of Linux on Surface Pro 4](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40973123)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 The author purchased a Surface Pro 4 in 2016 and was impressed with its form factor despite the average specs. They later gave it to a family member but continued to think about having a Linux tablet. They researched online and found success stories of installing Linux on the Surface, so they decided to experiment with it. The installation of Linux was easy and they tried two distros: EndeavourOS and Fedora workstation 40. Without the linux-surface kernel, most things worked except for the touch screen and stylus. After installing the linux-surface kernel, multi-touch and pressure-sensitive stylus functionality improved. Battery life was decent, and the automatic screen rotation worked. KDE with EndeavourOS was fast and responsive, while Gnome was less responsive but had a beautiful UI. However, the deal-breaker problem was touch recognition, specifically, ghost touch and palm rejection. The author tried various workarounds but was unable to completely resolve the issue, leading them to give up using Linux on the Surface. Despite virtual keyboards provided by KDE and Gnome, disk encryption with a password did not have a virtual keyboard.

## 6. [For advertising, Firefox now collects user data by default](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40974112)

**Total comment counts : 55**

### Summary

 Mozilla's latest version of Firefox, Firefox 128, is causing controversy among users due to its data collection practices. The new version introduces a technology for measuring advertising performance, but users are upset that this feature is automatically enabled by default. Users must manually opt out of the feature if they do not want their data collected. Critics argue that Mozilla should have informed users about the feature beforehand and given them the opportunity to test it. There are suspicions that Mozilla is trying to improve its own cash flow with this data collection, although the exact amount of money involved is unclear. The data collected is anonymized and stored on an aggregation server, but critics are concerned that this server is not part of an advertising network and that Mozilla could potentially modify the system in the future to give advertising providers access to individual data. This move by Mozilla has caused frustration among users who value privacy and trust in the browser provider. Firefox's main competitor is Google Chrome, and this controversy may push users to seek alternative web browsers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 7. [The Delusion of the Polygraph](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40972437)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 This article is a personal account of the author's experience taking a polygraph exam. The author was required to take the exam because they had applied for a job with Customs and Border Protection. The article describes the author's nervousness and the odd guidelines given by the government not to do any research on polygraphs before the exam. The author meets their examiner, Kevin, and is led to a plain room with office chairs for the exam. The author expresses a feeling of premonition that they will fail the exam. The article also briefly discusses the history of polygraphs, mentioning John Larson as one of its inventors.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with a contractor for DARPA, where they learned about the use of polygraph exams for security clearances. The author initially believed that polygraph exams were fake, but a seasoned industry veteran explained that while the machine itself may be a tool, the real value lies in the interviewer's ability to use it to convince the subject that they know the truth. The author's father, who went through the clearance process, admitted to confessing things during the polygraph exam that he wouldn't have told anyone else. Overall, the article suggests that while the polygraph may be seen as fake, it can still be effective in extracting information from subjects.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 According to the article, the author underwent a polygraph test and experienced discomfort. However, during the test, the interviewer noticed symptoms of heart arrhythmia and recommended that the author see a doctor. The author followed this advice and was diagnosed with a mild case of heart arrhythmia, which was determined to not be too serious.

## 8. [Decoding DME aircraft radio navigation system with the LimeSDR](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40974060)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 The article discusses DME (distance measuring equipment), an aircraft radio navigation system that measures the distance between an aircraft and a DME station on the ground. DME works by measuring the two-way time of flight of pulse pairs transmitted by the aircraft and retransmitted by the ground station. The author wants to analyze a recording of DME to show that the delay between the aircraft and ground station pulses matches the calculated delay. The author explores the use of SDRs (software-defined radios) to record the two DME channels, specifically discussing the AD9361 and LMS7002M chips used in devices like the LimeSDR. The author considers different sampling rates and explains the on-chip DDC (digital downconverter) in the LMS7002M that can be used to extract the DME channel and deliver a lower sample rate.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses a method of using a receiver near a VOR/DME station to determine the distance between an aircraft and the station. They explain that this method can be improved by placing the receiver far from the DME station, allowing for the calculation of the aircraft's distance from both the DME station and the receiver. By using multiple receivers, it is possible to obtain a more accurate location of the aircraft. The author suggests that this technique could serve as a backup for ADS-B, a system that indicates the aircraft's estimated location. However, it does not provide information on the aircraft's identity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of VORs (Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range) in airplanes. Initially, the author believed that each plane had its own antenna to determine the direction to the VOR. However, they explain that the direction is actually calculated through the phase shift between an omnidirectional and a directional signal, making it a cost-effective implementation for any plane.

## 9. [Shapeshift: Semantically map JSON objects using key-level vector embeddings](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40972130)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article introduces Shapeshift, a TypeScript library that allows mapping of JSON objects using vector embeddings. The library enables flexible and intelligent object transformation by using semantic similarity to match keys between objects, including support for nested structures. Shapeshift can handle nested objects in both the source and target structures by allowing flexible mapping between different object structures. The article also mentions that contributions to the project are welcome and it is licensed under the MIT License.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses ways to make a code more efficient. It suggests caching embeddings, changing the design of the tool, and pre-calculating embeddings for common keys. It also recommends optimizing the code by using a different approach to avoid tripping the rate-limit of the OpenAI API. The article provides code examples and links to relevant resources for further information.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article suggests that a bag of words comparison with a subword tokenizer could handle the given example without the need for machine learning. Alternatively, if embeddings are required, fastText is recommended as it is faster, cheaper, and can run locally. In more difficult cases, gpt-4o can be used to create a map based on the source/target schemas, which can then be applied to all instances.
