### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains how congestion is communicated between the sender and receiver in a network. There are three flags involved in this process. The sender sets a flag to inform routers that it can handle Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). The router then sets a flag to indicate congestion to the recipient, instead of dropping the packet. The recipient, upon receiving the packet with the congestion flag, sets a flag in its next TCP ACK to inform the sender. The sender reacts to the congestion as if a packet had been dropped and acknowledges the recipient's flag in the TCP header of the next packet sent.

## 7. [The surprising connection between after-hours work and decreased productivity](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38595245)

**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

 Slack's Workforce Index conducted a survey of over 10,000 desk workers worldwide to identify how to structure the workday for maximum productivity and well-being. The findings suggest that working after hours is often linked to lower productivity and may indicate that employees are overwhelmed with tasks and need support in prioritizing and managing their time. Approximately 37% of desk workers log in outside of standard hours due to pressure, resulting in 20% lower productivity scores compared to those who adhere to the standard workday. Those who choose to work outside of standard hours report no negative effects and even experience improved wellness and productivity. The study also highlights that many desk workers struggle to balance their time at work, with executives spending excessive time in meetings and emails. It further reveals that half of desk workers rarely or never take breaks during the workday, which leads to higher burnout rates. However, those who take breaks have higher scores for work-life balance, better stress and anxiety management, greater overall satisfaction, and slightly higher productivity scores. The survey also indicates that the late afternoon, between 3 and 6pm, is the least productive time for desk workers, regardless of their preferred productivity hours. The study encourages the recognition that productivity is not linear and occurs in bursts throughout the day, rather than in prescribed time windows or uninterrupted eight-hour blocks.

 The article discusses two issues related to Apple's Messages app. The first issue is that messages are sent and received via email address instead of phone numbers. The second issue is that when an Android phone number is added to a group chat, the app automatically switches the entire chat to unencrypted SMS, causing inconvenience and a poor user experience. This results in messages being received as email attachments with addresses such as 2345678901@domain. Additionally, the article criticizes the app for making it difficult to distinguish between email addresses and phone numbers in group chats and not prioritizing phone numbers when both are available for a contact.
