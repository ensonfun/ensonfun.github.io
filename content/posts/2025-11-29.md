## 1. [All it takes is for one to work out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46090433)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The author recalls a bleak stretch applying to graduate school after a rocky undergrad and a just-okay GMAT. A friend kept saying, “All it takes is for one to work out,” a line he initially doubted but later verified when one offer changed his life. The piece argues this truth applies to high-stakes searches—admissions, jobs, homes, relationships: you don’t need every option to succeed, just the one that’s the right fit, a mindset that can ground you through brutal processes.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread debates whether success comes mainly from luck and repeated chances or from merit and deliberate choices, and how persistence, timing, and resources shape outcomes and perceptions.
- Concern: Overreliance on the idea of a single winning opportunity or endless attempts can distort reality, foster false optimism, and leave people unprepared when luck runs out.
- Perspectives: Some emphasize safety nets, multiple pursuits, and perseverance as keys to success, while others warn that luck and the “one win” narrative can mislead and suggest the need for balance and broader life goals.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 2. [Be Like Clippy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46090172)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The Be Like Clippy movement condemns trillion-dollar platforms that mine user data, coerce use, or ransom data, and advocates opt-out data collection, openness, and user-friendly design. It invites developers, companies, and users to adopt a more transparent, open approach to technology, embodied by making products resemble Clippy—friendly and helpful. A video explains the movement; the initiative is GPL-3.0 licensed, and participants are encouraged to share on GitHub.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion frames a modern AI data-collection critique as a Clippy-inspired warning about social engineering and misaligned AI, sparking debate over control and intent. 
- Concern: The main worry is that AI systems will prioritize their own objectives and data extraction over human autonomy, leading to pervasive manipulation and loss of control. 
- Perspectives: Views range from alarmist critiques of AI/data capitalism and movement co-optation, to nostalgic defenses of Clippy, to satirical or humorous takes that question seriousness and legitimacy. 
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 3. [Show HN: Nano PDF – A CLI Tool to Edit PDFs with Gemini's Nano Banana](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46090619)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 Nano PDF (aka Nano Banana) is a CLI tool to edit PDF slides with natural language prompts, powered by Google's Gemini 3 Pro Image. It requires a paid API key with billing. It can edit a single page or multiple pages and insert AI-generated slides that match your deck's style using style references. The tool processes pages in parallel for speed and supports 4K/2K/1K resolution. Prerequisites include poppler and Tesseract; set the API key as an environment variable and verify tools with which. It uses Tesseract OCR to restore searchable text; OCR may struggle with stylized fonts or small text.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A workflow that converts PDF pages into images with a hidden OCR text layer (using Tesseract) to preserve text state, edit the image, and then reassemble back into a PDF.
- Concern: It risks reducing text selectability and bounding-box information, potentially harming usability and accessibility, even if OCR text remains.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic approval and interest in UI-based editing and potential LLM-assisted annotation to concerns about per-edit costs and a desire for clearer demonstrations.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed with strong enthusiasm.

## 4. [Learning Feynman's Trick for Integrals](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46090269)

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 Feynman's trick, differentiating under the integral sign, was popularized by Richard Feynman though rooted in Leibniz. The author recounts Feynman's self-taught approach from Advanced Calculus, enabling him to solve integrals others couldn't using unconventional tools, which boosted his reputation. This method feels like a cheat code—creative and powerful, but not systematically taught, making it obscure for newcomers. The author promises practical heuristics and examples to learn when and how to apply it. The core condition: if f(x,t) and its partial derivative ∂f/∂t are continuous on [a,b], one may differentiate under the integral sign. Starting with a challenging logarithmic integral.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The comment claims a major error in a differentiation-under-the-integral step, arguing that I'(t) should be ∫_0^1 x^{t-1}/ln x dx rather than ∫_0^1 x^t dx = 1/(t+1), and that these two expressions are not generally equal. 
- Concern: If the step is indeed wrong, the resulting conclusion or formula may be invalid. 
- Perspectives: Perspective: A single critical viewpoint is presented, challenging the derivation and offering an alternative expression, with no other viewpoints shown. 
- Overall sentiment: Highly critical

## 5. [Post-mortem of Shai-Hulud attack on November 24th, 2025](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46057141)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 On Nov 24, 2025, a self-replicating worm (Shai-Hulud 2.0) infected PostHog’s npm JavaScript SDKs. A preinstall script scanned for secrets with Trufflehog, exfiltrated them to a public GitHub repo, and used leaked npm credentials to publish further malicious packages. The attackers earlier stole a GitHub bot PAT and other CI secrets, including broad repo access, via a hijacked workflow in mid-Nov to exfiltrate secrets. The malicious npm packages went live at 04:11 UTC. PostHog identified, deleted them, revoked tokens, and began credential rotation. Recommendations: pin dependencies, and use a high minimumReleaseAge. Script-based PostHog remains unaffected.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A misconfigured assign-reviewers.yml workflow allowed external contributors to merge PRs without proper reviews, creating a security risk.
- Concern: This oversight could enable malicious code merges, security breaches, or theft of bot access tokens.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from alarm over security and usability criticisms to appreciation for the writeup and curiosity about analyzing the exploit.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [Zero knowlege proof of compositeness](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46089394)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) let you answer a question without revealing anything beyond the answer. Examples: a digital signature proves possession of a private key without exposing it; a card-deck illustration shows a missing card is a spade by proving all other suits remain. Fermat’s primality test can form a ZKP: if n is composite, some base b yields bn−1 ≠ 1 mod n, certifying compositeness (though Carmichael numbers can defeat this, and you can’t prove primality). ZKPs can also prove properties (e.g., correct accounting) without revealing inputs, enabling private verifications in crypto and beyond.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread critiques common zero-knowledge proof teaching examples as often failing to be truly zero-knowledge and suggests graph isomorphism as a clearer, more faithful demonstration.
- Concern: Popular examples may leak information or rely on trust assumptions, undermining the zero-knowledge property and miseducating learners.
- Perspectives: Different viewpoints range from criticizing traditional examples (cards, compositeness, cave) to promoting graph isomorphism as a better teaching tool, along with technical clarifications about what counts as zero-knowledge and related concepts like primality tests and digital signatures.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 7. [An update on the Farphone's battery](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46078684)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article describes running a website on an old smartphone and the fire risk of keeping a lithium battery charged. Lobste.rs and Hacker News readers warned about it, and French blogger Korben noted how modular the Fairphone 2 is, making battery removal easy. The author duct-taped a micro-USB cable to the phone to power it without the battery, avoiding a potential denial-of-service risk or fire. About 40 seconds later the “farphone” booted and the web server was back online. Thanks to readers; written by Louis Merlin under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread debates whether the Fairphone 2 can run from USB without a battery, alongside battery safety concerns and a solar-charging workaround.
- Concern: The main worry is battery-related safety risks (swelling, smoking, fires) and whether USB/solar power would be a safe, reliable alternative.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from skepticism about a battery-less phone and safety concerns, to acknowledgement that battery failures exist but are relatively rare, to proposing solar-panel charging as a practical workaround.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [The Origins of Scala (2009)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46090294)

**Total comment counts : 2**

### Summary

 Scala is a JVM-based, object-oriented and functional language created by Martin Odersky of EPFL. In this interview excerpt, Odersky recounts his lifelong interest in programming languages, starting as an undergraduate who bootstrapped a Modula-2 compiler for the Z80 using a Pascal subset and evolving it to full Modula-2; Borland briefly pursued a version sold as Turbo Modula-2/TopSpeed Modula-2, and Peter Sollich joined them. Odersky then pursued graduate work and a Ph.D. with Niklaus Wirth. By 1988–89 he turned to functional programming, collaborating with Phil Wadler, which shaped his later Scala work.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on Scala's versatility and its enterprise-use challenges, alongside the observation that Kotlin has gained more JVM traction.
- Concern: The main worry is that Scala's broad paradigm support makes enterprise adoption harder, while Kotlin's popularity may eclipse Scala.
- Perspectives: Perspectives range from praising Scala as a great, flexible language to expressing mild disappointment that Kotlin is gaining more JVM traction.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 9. [Show HN: Network Monitor – a GUI to spot anomalous connections on your Linux](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46032074)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 An Eero router user laments the lack of polished, home-friendly network tools for growing homelab/self-hosted setups. They dislike relying on scraping ss output, pointing out that many devops/CI/CD pipelines depend on its format and that parsing human-readable text is brittle. They question whether newer tools reveal more than netstat -tulpn and note they once wrote a script to loop netstat for similar purposes. The post also references the bandwhich project on GitHub and includes playful sarcasm and casual chatter.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Discussion centers on improving a network-monitoring project with a polished GUI and robust data collection, weighing eBPF/XDP against scraping and parsing 'ss' output.
- Concern: Relying on parsing text intended for humans (ss output) is brittle and prone to breakage, suggesting a need for more robust data sources like eBPF.
- Perspectives: Perspectives span enthusiasm for a GUI and home-user tools, appreciation for the current GTK/Rust stack, calls for a CLI version, and advocacy for eBPF/XDP as a more robust alternative to ss parsing.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
