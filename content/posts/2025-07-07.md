## 1. [Hidden interface controls that affect usability](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44476297)

**Total comment counts : 67**

### Summary

 Douglas Engelbart introduced the concept of "knowledge in the world" versus "knowledge in the head" in interface design, later popularized by Donald Norman. Knowledge in the world means controls are visible and easily identified, as seen in drop-down menus, enabling users to perform tasks without memorization. However, we are increasingly reverting to designs requiring significant knowledge in the head, especially with modern devices like smartphones. These often have hidden controls that complicate simple tasks, underscoring the need for visible controls to improve user experience and accessibility.
