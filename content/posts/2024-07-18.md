### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Elligator is a bidirectional map used for censorship resistance that converts random bytes to elliptic curve points. It is primarily integrated with the obfs4 protocol, one of the Tor circumvention pluggable transports. Previous implementations of Elligator have had subtle bugs, but there are now third-party test vectors available. The direct map from random bytes to points is useful in cryptography for various purposes, such as verifiable random functions (VRFs). The direct map has been specified more rigorously in certain standards and documents. Ristretto provides a map from a fixed amount of random bytes and is part of the fundamental group abstraction, while the CFRG approach offers domain-separated hash "suites" that directly produce curve points.

## 4. [Closed form arc length parametrization is impossible for quadratic Bézier curves](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40991075)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses Bézier curves, which are commonly used in computer graphics to define vector graphics. It explains that Bézier curves are polynomial parametric curves given in the Bernstein basis, and they can be defined using control points. The article mentions that there are two types of Bézier curves: quadratic (defined by three control points) and cubic (defined by four control points).

The article then discusses the concept of arc length, which is the distance traveled when moving along a curve from start to end. It notes that while the arc length of quadratic Bézier curves can be computed with a closed form expression, the arc length of cubic Bézier curves cannot, and it has to be computed numerically.

The article mentions that proving the lack of a closed form solution for the arc length parametrization of quadratic Bézier curves is challenging. It introduces Schanuel's conjecture, which states that there is no nontrivial polynomial relationship between the numbers α and e^α. The article explains that assuming Schanuel's conjecture is true, Lin's result can be used to prove the nonexistence of a closed form arc length parametrization for quadratic Bézier curves.

The article then delves into the mathematics behind the proof, discussing rational numbers, polynomials over rational numbers, irreducible polynomials, and algebraic numbers. It concludes by acknowledging that the desired result depends on an unproven conjecture but assumes its truth to make progress in the proof.

Overall, the article explores the difficulty of finding a closed form solution for the arc length parametrization of Bézier curves and references Schanuel's conjecture as a potential approach for proving its nonexistence.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the fact that the arc length of cubic Bézier curves cannot be computed using a closed form formula and must instead be computed numerically. The author laments that they have not seen a proof sketch for this. The article also mentions that there are exceptions to this, such as Pythagorean-Hodograph curves, which have closed form solutions and could be useful in many applications. However, due to a lack of mathematicians working in computer graphics, numerical solutions are often used instead.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the fact that the arc length of cubic Bézier curves cannot be determined using a closed form formula and needs to be calculated numerically. The writer acknowledges that they have not yet come across a proof for this statement. A cubic Bézier curve is described as a cubic polynomial of t in the range of 0 to 1, with four control points. The length of the curve is the integral from 0 to 1 of the square root of (1 + (B&#x27;)^2), which is a quartic function. This integral is known to be reducible to elliptic integrals, which do not have a closed form solution.

## 8. [Overcoming the limits of current LLMs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40991549)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) such as hallucinations, lack of confidence estimates, and lack of citations. Hallucination refers to the generation of content that may seem convincing or factual but is actually incorrect. Confidence estimates are important for determining the reliability of predictions, and lack of citations means that the model doesn't base its responses on reliable sources. The author suggests that addressing these limitations would lead to better LLM chatbots. One possible solution is to exclude contradicting training data and supervise the training process to create a consistent LLM. The idea is to curate a high-quality text corpus based on reliable sources, train a base model, and gradually extend the training data to create a big consistent LLM. The author also suggests exploring the idea of training models with different world views by curating different training datasets. The article provides references for further reading on the topic.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that the hallucinations of language models (LLMs) are not solely due to errors in their training data, but also a result of their ability to remix, interpolate, and extrapolate answers to questions that are not directly addressed in the dataset. For instance, a legal question posed to a chatbot could lead it to cite a non-existent precedent that seems plausible based on existing cases. The article argues that this issue cannot be solved by training the models solely on factual data. The author also expresses sadness at the investment of talented people and resources in developing these AI chatbots and questions if this is truly creating a better world.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that one of the reasons LLMs (Language Models) are popular is because they can easily be scaled up by purchasing more computing capacity and collecting more text data to train them. However, without large and diverse training datasets, LLMs cannot generate high-quality results. Manually curating reliable datasets is much more difficult, expensive, and time-consuming than using whatever information is available on the internet. The article mentions Wolfram Alpha as a successful example of a curated dataset, but it does not have the capability to create fantastical results effortlessly or show exponential improvement.

## 9. [Sparrows may be 'canary in the coal mine' for lead poisoning in children: study](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40995527)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses a study that found house sparrows can be used to monitor lead exposure in children. The study focused on two Australian towns affected by lead mining, Broken Hill and Mount Isa, where lead exposure in children is a major concern. By collecting blood lead samples from the sparrows and comparing the results to local children's blood lead data, the researchers found that where lead exposure was highest in sparrows, it was also highest in children. The study suggests that sparrows can be used as a monitoring tool for environmental pollution on a neighborhood scale. Lead poisoning can have severe effects on children's mental and physical development.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Lead poisoning in Australian mining towns, such as Broken Hill and Mount Isa, is a controversial issue. Local mayors often try to hide or dismiss evidence of lead poisoning because the towns rely on the mines for their existence. In Broken Hill, the original mine has been completely removed, leaving only a slag heap that sits in the middle of the town. The wind carries the lead-laden dust from the heap into the streets and backyards. Similarly, in Mount Isa, the mine and smelter are located to the west of the town, with prevailing winds causing the toxic dust to settle on the town.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests an alternative approach to bisecting flakes, which involves using information probing operations and Bayesian inference. This method allows for noisy benchmarks or low-probability flakes to be analyzed. By narrowing down the probable range of failure with each new observation, new probes can be chosen to maximize information gain. The article recommends providing flake rate probability for probability estimates, but even rough estimates work well. Implementing this method can greatly improve the robustness of the bisecting process. The article concludes by mentioning the simplicity of the math involved and the possibility of re-implementing the prototype for the open source community.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a cool debugging technique that involves running a test with coverage reporting.
