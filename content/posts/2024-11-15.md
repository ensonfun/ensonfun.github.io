### Summary

 Thomas Eugene Kurtz, who passed away on November 12, 2024, was a pivotal figure in the development of computer science, co-inventing the BASIC programming language and the Dartmouth Timesharing System (DTSS) with John Kemeny. Born in 1928 in Oak Park, Illinois, Kurtz graduated from Knox College and later earned a PhD in mathematics from Princeton University. His early career included working on the SWAC at UCLA, one of the earliest electronic computers in the U.S.

Kurtz and Kemeny developed BASIC in the 1960s to provide a simple programming language for non-professional users, particularly undergraduates. They also created the DTSS to enable multiple students to access the computer simultaneously via campus terminals. This system was introduced in 1964 and was instrumental in making computing accessible to a broader audience. 

Following these innovations, BASIC saw widespread adoption across various computing platforms, influencing the rise of personal computing, notably through Microsoft's version for the Altair 8800. Kurtz held several significant positions at Dartmouth, including director roles and contributing to educational computing programs. He was also involved in standardizing BASIC through national and international committees. Kurtz retired from Dartmouth in 1993 after a distinguished career, leaving behind a legacy in educational computing and programming language development.

**Total comment counts : 75**

### Summary

 The article discusses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in playing chess, detailing a year-long progression and regression in their performance. Initially, there was excitement about LLMs' ability to play chess at an amateur level by merely predicting moves from text, despite not being designed specifically for chess. However, after an initial period of optimism around September-October 2023, where LLMs were reported to play at an advanced amateur level, there followed a year of silence and then a noticeable decline in performance. 

The author conducted experiments with various LLMs like Llama, Qwen, Command-R, Gemma, and different versions of OpenAI's models including gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4o. Most models performed terribly against Stockfish, even on its lowest difficulty setting, with the notable exception of gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, which performed exceptionally well. The article reflects on the inconsistency in LLMs' ability to handle chess, suggesting that while some models can perform well, the overall trend shows a lack of sustained improvement or understanding of chess strategy beyond basic moves. This raises questions about how LLMs process and utilize the information from chess games within their training data.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that OpenAI might have specifically optimized their model, gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, to excel at chess to gain attention or meet a particular benchmark. However, this optimization was not carried over to subsequent models because it did not continue to generate significant media interest.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses various challenges and methods used in testing AI models, particularly in the context of chess move generation:
