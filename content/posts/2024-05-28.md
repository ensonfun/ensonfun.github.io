### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that understanding and improving the concept of "grokking" should be the focus of AI. Currently, AI is reliant on memorizing circuits that perform well in specific use cases, but this approach is not ideal for generalizing circuits. The paper mentioned in the article highlights the importance of the distribution of training data in influencing generalization behavior.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of "grokking," which is similar to the idea presented in the book "The Dip." It explains that most people only invest effort in learning, training, or improving until they reach a point where their returns become flat or negative. However, those who excel at a particular task are the ones who have successfully navigated through the dip in the return curve per unit of effort.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is discussing the difference between understanding and curve fitting. They argue that simply fitting curves to data is not the same as true understanding. They point out that human intelligence can operate deterministically and non-deterministically, and understanding requires less data than brute forcing pattern recognition. The author uses the example of understanding multiplication and addition to illustrate how true understanding allows for computation without prior data. They emphasize the importance of differentiating between approximation and calculation. The author concludes by stating that current language models lack true understanding and only approximate it.
