## 1. [Review of Hetzner ARM64 servers and experience of WebP cloud services on them](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36368586)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses the rise of ARM64 architecture servers and their role in the server field. After discontinuing ARM64 machines in 2020, Scaleway resumed offering servers with ARM64 processors in 2023, utilizing the Altra Max processor. AWS was the only mainstream cloud service provider to continue offering ARM64 machines between 2020 and 2023, using their own Graviton processors. Hetzner then introduced their ARM64 cloud servers under the CAX line in 2023, based on Ampere Altra processors, offering excellent value for money. The article also includes performance benchmark tests conducted on Hetzner ARM64 servers and discusses why Hetzner's CAX series machines were chosen as their server provider.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author has been using Hetzner's EX line for a while and finds it very cost-effective. They have not been able to find any other provider that offers cheaper services.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article points out that TFA incorrectly describes the E3-1230 as an 8 core server, when in fact it only has 4 cores with 8 threads. This means that comparisons between ARM and x86 performance per core are inaccurate. The author suggests that Hetzner auction dedis are a good option for affordable and reliable computational power.

## 4. [Merging bcachefs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36366002)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The creator of bcachefs, Kent Overstreet, recently led a session remotely at the 2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit on getting the filesystem upstream. He noted that the goal with bcachefs, described as a "massive, 90,000-lines-of-code beast," is to have the "performance, reliability, scalability, and robustness of XFS with modern features". Features have been implemented, including snapshots and non-copy-on-write mode, while there is still work to be done around erasure coding. The codebase is approachable by developers, and while there is still a lot of work to do, Overstreet believes "the big feature work is lessening."

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that people are using snapshots to backup MySQL databases in order to test the robustness of the feature. The article also mentions the challenges of using btrfs for such workloads due to crippling fragmentation and recommends ZFS as a better alternative. Furthermore, the upcoming bcachefs filesystem's handling of these issues is also anticipated.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The developer of the open-source file system bcachefs, Kent Overstreet, is concerned about the number of file systems in the kernel and would like the acceptance process to be more conservative, as any change that affects all the file systems can quickly become a painful process. He believes that some file systems should be removed, and the process for accepting new file systems needs to become more cautious. Kent Overstreet's concerns are mainly due to the fact that file systems are a lot more integrated and less modular than other subsystems in the kernel.

## 6. [Humans have pumped enough groundwater to change the tilt of the Earth](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36366137)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 A new study found that humans have shifted the distribution of water on Earth by pumping groundwater, enough to alter the planet's tilt and even affect the Earth's rotational pole. The research estimated that humans pumped over 2 trillion tons of groundwater between 1993 to 2010, which led to the rise of global sea levels by a quarter of an inch. Humans redistributed enough water from 1993 to 2010 to move the rotational pole approximately 31 inches, according to the study.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is a complaint about the lack of primary sources cited in a piece about the relationship between groundwater depletion and global sea level rise. The author calls for the use of primary sources and provides links to both the official press release and the original study.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article questions the accuracy of a claim that melting icebergs due to climate change can shift the Earth's axis and cause a change in gravitational pull. The author thinks the claim is exaggerated as the change in angular momentum would be about 7 orders of magnitude smaller than what the claim suggests.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author initially found mathematical proofs to be fuzzy and intuition-based, with no clear criteria for what counts as a valid inference step. However, they later learned about natural deduction, a formal proof system with strictly defined inference rules, which removes the ambiguity of what constitutes a valid or invalid proof. While this approach may be too tedious for actual mathematical proofs, the author believes that it would be helpful for students to first learn logic and deduction properly before moving on to more advanced mathematical concepts. The author notes the irony that formal logic is often taught in philosophy, rather than in mathematics or computer science, despite its relevance to these fields.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a teaching method used by the author at Dartmouth College to help students understand mathematical proofs. The author gave students a handout with a proof and asked them to follow along as they walked through the proof together. The students were initially skeptical, but the author prompted them to participate and explain each step. By the end, the students had produced a complete proof of a result they initially didn't understand and gained confidence in the process. One student even compared the experience to making a shopping list.
