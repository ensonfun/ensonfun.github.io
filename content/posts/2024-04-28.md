### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses how the use of inbound links as a quality signal for website importance has been negatively impacted. In the past, having more people linking to your site indicated its significance, but now it has become extremely difficult to obtain any legitimate inbound links. This is due to the fact that people no longer create web pages or websites, instead relying on platforms like Twitter and Facebook to share information. These platforms tag the links as "nofollow/ugc," which means they do not count towards search engine optimization (SEO). As a result, the primary link signal is now from link farms and paid media. The article emphasizes that if you do not engage in shady tactics, your site will not appear in search results, effectively reducing your influence and visibility. The author suggests that we have lost our ability to influence search results due to our own choices.

## 3. [Let's Embed a Go Program into the Linux Kernel (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40184515)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 This article discusses a lesser-known feature of the Linux kernel that allows user-space programs to be embedded directly into the kernel image and executed from there. This feature is useful in cases where the kernel needs to run helper programs. Typically, programs are launched from the file system using the execve() system call, but this approach requires the program to be installed and loadable. However, in certain situations where the root file system is attached using network storage, this can become problematic if the network connection is unavailable. To address this issue, the article presents an alternative mechanism where a user space program is embedded into the kernel image itself, eliminating the need for file system access. The article provides an example of embedding a Go program into the kernel and explains how to use the User Mode Driver API to execute the embedded program. The API also establishes a communication pipe between the program and the kernel for efficient communication.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the Usermode Driver API in Linux, which allows drivers to delegate work to userspace. This feature can be used with or without access to a working filesystem. The author mentions that this capability was previously dismissed in a discussion about in-kernel codecs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the relationship between the initrd and the loading of programs and modules before the filesystem becomes available. The initrd's purpose is described as embedding these programs and modules in an image that is loaded with the kernel.

## 4. [How to improve the RISC-V specification](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40185065)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses the RISC-V specification and its strengths and weaknesses. The specification consists of several parts, including two PDF documents that describe the architecture, test suites to check processor implementation, a simulator for comparison, and a formal specification model. However, the specification is not in a healthy state due to imprecise language, lack of configurability, and disconnection between the different artifacts. The author suggests improving the specification by including parts of the formal specification in the PDF documents and capturing the architecture in easily readable and manipulable formats like JSON or XML. This would make it easier for developers to create consistent code and support architecture extensions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the weakness of the RISC-V specification document and the need for improvements. The author highlights issues such as inconsistencies and the lack of a clear technical editor. They also mention the difficulty of creating a specification that is independent of any implementation and the need for a team with technical knowledge and accurate technical English. The author agrees that a better specification would be valuable and expresses hope for its future development.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their experience working with Sail, a language for specifying computer architectures. They mention that there is already a way to extract functions into asciidoc, which works well. They also mention that while liquid types may be confusing at first, they are mostly used for utility function definitions and not in most of the code. The author praises Sail as a fantastic language that helps avoid bugs. However, they point out two actual problems with the RISC-V spec: the abundance of undefined/implementation defined behavior and the lack of configurability in the RISC-V Sail model. The author agrees with the criticism of the spec's imprecise language.

## 9. [TfL's simple pop-up message led to a significant drop in paper ticket sales](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40187379)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 Transport for London (TfL) has intentionally reduced the sale of paper tickets by encouraging customers to use contactless payments instead. This change was implemented last September and resulted in a significant drop in paper ticket sales. TfL added pop-up messages on ticket machines to suggest using contactless cards instead of paper tickets for single or return journeys. This not only aligns with TfL's goal of reducing paper ticket sales but also allows customers to pay cheaper fares. The change has reduced queues at ticket machines and is expected to encourage more frequent use of public transport.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their experience with using paper tickets and contactless payment methods for transportation in London. They mention receiving a paper ticket for free during the Olympic Games in 2012, but otherwise primarily using an Oyster card. They also comment on the convenience and seamlessness of using Google or Apple Pay for contactless tapping in and out of public transportation. The author finds this system impressive and believes it should be expanded to other cities in the UK.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a message stating that passengers can use a card reader instead of buying a ticket to travel. The machine used, called the Passenger Operated Machine (POM), does not display all ticket options since not all destinations accept contactless PAYG tickets. This suggests that there are three payment methods available: contactless credit/debit card, contactless PAYG ticket, and paper/magnetic stripe ticket. If a passenger uses a contactless PAYG ticket to enter but finds it is not accepted at their destination, it is unclear what happens.
