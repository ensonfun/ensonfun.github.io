## 9. [Logging all C++ destructors, poor mans run-time tracing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41611948)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses a challenging shutdown issue encountered with an embedded application that either segfaulted or terminated unexpectedly. The author, Remy van Elst, describes how adding runtime instrumentation using GCC helped log destructors, allowing for insight into what was preventing a proper shutdown. The process involved implementing a logging function for user-defined class destructors, linking the program to dynamic libraries, and using specific compiler flags for instrumentation. Despite confirming that the author’s code was destructing correctly, segfaults remained due to complexities introduced by an external, closed-source framework. Strategies for effectively debugging in large, multi-threaded applications are shared, along with example code and setup instructions. The author also notes the negative impact of invasive tracking from Google Ads and Analytics on their site and promotes an open-source project called Leaf Node Monitoring.
