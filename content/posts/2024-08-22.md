### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Microsoft's recent update to Windows which left dual-boot setups vulnerable to attack. The intention was for the update to only apply to Windows-only systems, while dual-boot setups would remain vulnerable until the installed distro updated its grub and shipped its own update. The article questions what went wrong and suggests that this issue may have occurred due to the EFI boot order or the use of the firmware menu to select Linux or Windows. The author also mentions their plan to install Linux on their work PC to avoid this issue, but notes that it would not have prevented the problem. The article concludes that Microsoft's fix was legitimate, but there was a breakdown in communication.

## 2. [Breaking down a record-setting day on the Texas grid](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41313290)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 On August 20th, 2024, ERCOT experienced records for demand, solar generation, net load, and battery discharge. Solar generation kept prices under control during the day, but as solar decreased, prices increased. High prices were more associated with high net load rather than gross load, meaning demand that must be met by resources with higher marginal costs. As the sun set, ERCOT had to call on resources with higher fuel costs and operation and maintenance components, leading to higher energy prices. Battery discharge reached a new peak, 20% higher than the previous record, due to the extensive use of ECRS. The settlement point price nearly reached the bid cap of $5,000, and the reduction of ORDC adders contributed to sustained high prices. Despite this, ERCOT did not issue a general call for conservation, indicating confidence in the grid's resources. While load records may not be broken this summer, solar generation could set new peaks and unexpected grid events could trigger a response from batteries.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of this article is discussing their observations about their thermostat's "rush hours" coinciding with peak energy usage and high energy prices. They suggest that participating in the "rush hour" program may actually be costing them more money rather than saving it. They acknowledge that these programs are primarily meant to limit overall energy use during peak times, but they may decide not to follow the program in the future.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the rapidly evolving market for wind, solar, and battery deployment. It highlights the resistance in Texas to connecting to the rest of the US grid, which would allow them to import power cheaply when needed and export excess power. It suggests that Texas may currently have to curtail a lot of energy due to an oversupply. The article also mentions that California and Texas are burning a lot of gas while experiencing negative pricing due to wind delivering more power than needed. It questions why states aren't taking advantage of the surplus power to export it for profit.

## 3. [SIMD Matters: Graph Coloring](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41315359)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

## 5. [Euphemisms are best changed frequently (2016)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41315126)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of euphemisms and how language evolves over time. It argues that the changing terminology used to describe certain groups or phenomena is a healthy and necessary process due to the disconnect between language and opinion. The author gives examples of words like "crippled" and "handicapped" that have been replaced over time with terms like "disabled" and "differently abled" to avoid negative connotations. The article concludes that this constant semantic renewal is a result of the messy nature of language and its associations with experiences and biases.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The URL for an article about the "euphemism treadmill" has been changed. However, readers may still want to check out both the original URL and the article it now points to.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author disagrees with the idea of changing euphemisms because they believe that the real problem lies in the thoughts and stereotypes that people have, not the words themselves. They argue that renaming something does little to change perceptions and instead creates stigma for those who are not up to date with the latest language. They give an example of the renaming of disability to dysability, which has since disappeared. The author believes that euphemisms often lack clarity and can be used as a replacement for offensive words without addressing underlying prejudice. They suggest that the real issue is changing societal attitudes towards others and not creating linguistic difficulties for everyone else.

## 8. [Turnstyle – An esoteric, graphical functional language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41312521)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 The article introduces a new graphical programming language called Turnstyle. The author was inspired by Piet, a programming language with some brilliant design aspects but also some limitations. The author wanted to create a functional variant of Piet based on Lambda Calculus, with a minimal specification and the ability to reuse code. After experimenting with different designs, the author came up with Turnstyle, which is simpler than Lambda Calculus but more expressive, allowing the creation of Abstract Syntax Graphs. The full specification and examples can be found on the Turnstyle website and GitHub. Feedback from Francesco Mazzoli was also appreciated.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is confused about the interpretation of the lambda calculus specification in the article. They question whether the graphic interpreter represents procedural execution or is it just a visualization of beta-reduction. The author then clarifies their understanding, stating that the program starts with a single term `turnstyle(x, y, dir)` which is lazily evaluated to the actual term. They believe that calling it an "encoding" is a misnomer and emphasize that both evaluation and parsing are lazy, which is a key point of the esolang.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The reader expresses difficulty in understanding a specification and suggests that including examples, such as "2+3" and "(lambda f. lambda x. (f (f x)))(lambda y. (y+2)) 3," would be helpful.
