**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 In this article, the author discusses their research on vulnerabilities in WHOIS clients and how they parse responses from WHOIS servers. They discovered that the WHOIS server for the .MOBI TLD had migrated to a new domain and the old domain had expired. They decided to acquire the expired domain and set up a WHOIS server behind it. They found that many systems were actively speaking to their server, and they identified several Certificate Authorities using their server to determine domain ownership and verification details. This unintentionally undermined the CA process for the entire .mobi TLD. The author acknowledges the importance of this process for the security of internet communication and expresses their exasperation with the situation. They mention their initial intention to find vulnerabilities in WHOIS clients but ended up witnessing the foundation of secure internet communication crumble. The author also addresses skeptics who questioned the realism of their attack scenario, stating that it would require the resources and capabilities of a nation-state or someone with expertise in compromising TLD WHOIS servers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that one of the errors that led to a recent exploit could have been prevented if the WHOIS server for the .MOBI TLD had not been allowed to expire. The author advises businesses never to let a domain expire because once it is associated with the business, the association cannot be removed.

 DC-DC converters are efficient power supplies that convert current through an inductor into a voltage spike, which can be used to charge a capacitor and produce DC output. These converters have low resistance in the power path, resulting in high efficiency. However, they can be a fire hazard and require safety measures such as inrush current limiters and fuses. There are different types of DC-DC converters, including boost converters, buck converters, and transformers, with the latter being necessary for isolating the input from the output when using AC power. The article also mentions a specific DC-DC converter design that uses a USB input and generates 120VDC output for operating antique teletype machines. The circuit includes components like ferrite beads and capacitors to minimize noise.

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 This article explores a game called the Bell game that challenges classical physics and introduces quantum mechanics. The game involves three players - Alice, Bob, and Victor - who perform experiments to test Bell's theorem. The players use measurement devices to determine if the physical world can be explained by deterministic local hidden variables. The article explains how classical strategies adhere to Bell's inequality and how non-local action-at-a-distance and entangled qubits can break it. The goal of the game is to compute the Bell statistic, which quantifies the correlation between Alice and Bob's measurement outcomes. The article provides a mathematical formula for calculating the Bell statistic and discusses the implications of deterministic local hidden variables on the result.

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The article discusses how most websites use tracking technologies to collect user data and require permission through consent pop-ups. However, 90% of these pop-ups use "dark patterns" that make it difficult to decline consent. The use of dark patterns is illegal, but enforcement is lacking. The Consent-O-Matic browser extension is introduced as a tool that automatically fills out consent pop-ups based on user preferences, even when they employ dark patterns. The extension can be installed on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge for desktop, as well as Safari for mobile. Consent-O-Matic is open-source and does not process personal data. The extension only stores minimal data on the user's computer, and this data can be easily deleted. The extension may request access to user data to interact with consent pop-ups but does not collect information about visited websites or user activities. Reports of malfunctioning pop-ups may be sent to the developers, who store and analyze the URLs for improvement. Additionally, the Consent-O-Matic website collects certain data for security and performance evaluation purposes, which is stored for a limited time. Users have rights over their personal data and can contact the developers for inquiries or to exercise these rights.

## 8. [What is the best pointer tagging method?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41488377)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article explores pointer tagging, which involves encoding metadata into a word-sized pointer. This allows for a compact representation that can be efficiently processed by compilers. The author tests different ways of encoding tagged pointers and compares their performance. They find that alignment bit tagging performs well, especially for pointers with a tag value of zero. However, when dealing with non-zero tags, additional instructions are required to remove the tag before dereferencing the pointer. The author also notes that different compilers handle optimizations differently, with GCC outperforming LLVM in some cases. Additionally, the article mentions that the performance of tagged pointers can vary depending on the instruction set architecture, with low-byte tagging being faster on x86 compared to ARM. Overall, the article provides insights into the optimization potential and trade-offs of using pointer tagging in programming languages.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a workflow used by the author when collaborating on GitHub. The process involves incorporating feedback from reviewers and merging code changes. The main disadvantages are that it requires more work from the author and may not be obvious to collaborators. However, it offers advantages such as allowing reviewers to view differences without breaking `git blame` and `git bisect`. The author uses the command `git commit --fixup <commit hash>` to incorporate reviewer feedback and leaves a comment with the fixup commit hash. When the pull request is approved, the author merges the changes using `git rebase --interactive origin/main --autosquash` to combine fixup commits with the original ones. Finally, a `git push --force-with-lease` is executed to push the changes and merge them. The author notes the reliance on terminal autocomplete for efficiency and mentions that using a tool that supports and encourages this workflow would be beneficial. Although the author feels limited to using GitHub, they consider the workflow acceptable.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author agrees that the way Github handles updates is terrible and believes it is unfortunate that many people have gotten used to it. They mention using Phabricator for updates, which involved a somewhat-manual process, but it was made easier with command line macros. The author suggests that having a dedicated user interface for updates would be even better.

## 10. [AppleWatchAmmeter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41508752)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 This article discusses how to turn an Apple Watch or any watch with an accessible magnetometer into an ammeter to measure DC currents. It explains that newer Apple Watches, starting from Series 5, have a compass that also contains a magnetometer sensitive to magnetic fields from nearby currents. The article outlines the steps to use a coil of wire around the watch to alter the magnetic field sensed, and provides a formula for calculating the magnetic field generated by the coil. It suggests that an app can be used to calibrate and display the current in Amperes, and mentions that only DC currents can be detected since the magnetometer is too slow to react to AC currents. The article concludes by mentioning the sensitivity of the coil and the possibility of discerning small changes in current with careful observations.
