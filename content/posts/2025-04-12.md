 The article discusses William Gibson's reflections on mechanical watches, emphasizing their seemingly unnecessary nature as they do not keep time as accurately as digital alternatives like Swatch or Casio. Despite their impracticality, Gibson finds them comforting because they require regular maintenance, which he likens to the "Tamagotchi Gesture." He describes vintage mechanical watches as miniaturized, intricate worlds that embody the essence of the pre-digital age, with their complex moving parts giving them a sense of life. These watches can be painstakingly restored, much like old steam tractors or classic motorcycles, reinforcing their value as timeless objects that provide both comfort and connection to craftsmanship.

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The author provides an update on their progress developing a Rust to C compiler, highlighting their participation in Rust Week in Utrecht, Netherlands, where they will give a talk on the project. They aim to make the content accessible to beginners while discussing advanced concepts. The core test pass rate has improved to 95.9%, up from 92% two months prior, with about 65 tests still needing fixing—most due to similar issues. Notably, 96.3% of Rust core tests now run in .NET.

Key advancements include addressing issues with 128-bit intrinsics and subslicing, where past bugs affected performance by incorrectly handling data sizes.

**Total comment counts : 66**

### Summary

 Adobe's attempt to engage with users on the Twitter alternative Bluesky quickly backfired, leading to a backlash that resulted in the company removing its initial posts. The incident began with an innocuous introductory post from Adobe aimed at artists and creatives, which sparked frustration among Bluesky users who criticized the company's business practices, particularly its subscription pricing model. Users expressed their anger over Adobe's previous price hikes and its embrace of AI-generated art, leading to a flood of negative comments on both Adobe's and its Photoshop account's posts. This prompted Adobe to delete the content, a move that users found amusing, reflecting Adobe's perceived decline in standing within the creative community. The company's unpopularity has been attributed to its shift to subscription pricing over a decade ago and a lack of communication with users.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes Adobe for what the author describes as a deceptive billing practice related to their subscription plans. Many users mistakenly believe they are signing up for a monthly plan when, in fact, it is an "annual plan, billed monthly." As a result, users who cancel after one month face immediate charges for the remaining 11 months of the contract. The author expresses confusion over why Adobe has not faced action from the FTC regarding this issue, given that it has been their primary billing model for several years.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Adobe's ethical approach to AI training data and highlights the effectiveness of its AI features in Photoshop, which are praised for their quality in touch-up work. The author expresses that Adobe does not deserve much of the criticism it receives and hopes that this encourages the development of alternatives to its products.

## 8. [Why 'Prince Rupert's Drop' Glass Is Strong Enough to Shatter a Bullet (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43639253)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 Prince Rupert's drops are unique glass objects shaped like teardrops with a long tail. Despite their delicate appearance, the bulbous end is incredibly strong and cannot be broken even with a hammer or axe; only the impact of a bullet can shatter it. This strength comes from the way they're formed—when molten glass is dropped into cold water, it cools rapidly, creating a hard outer shell while the inside remains liquid longer. This process generates internal compressive strength and tension, making the glass extremely resilient. 

When disturbed, such as by a bullet, the drop emits a shockwave and shatters in place due to the release of internal tensions, creating beautiful cloud-like fragments. These principles of compressive strength and tension are echoed in the development of tough glass like Gorilla Glass, used in smartphone screens. Gorilla Glass is manufactured using ion exchange methods to enhance strength and resilience, providing a potentially protective layer for devices. The article emphasizes the fascinating science behind these objects and their possible applications in creating stronger materials for everyday use.

### Top 1 Comment Summary
