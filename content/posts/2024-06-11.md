## 6. [Forsp: A Forth+Lisp Hybrid Lambda Calculus Language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40633003)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses a programming language called Forsp, which combines features of Forth and Lisp. Forsp has a simple evaluator and uses a computation process similar to Forth. The language has three syntactic special forms, with "quote" being the only one that requires special handling. Thunks, which are pushed onto the stack, can be forced using the "force" term. Thunks also act as closures, binding the current environment on creation. Forsp is shockingly expressive and can be used to express the lambda calculus through simple re-write/re-ordering rules. It supports call-by-push-value (CBPV), combining the determinism of call-by-value and the laziness of call-by-name. Forsp also includes a fixpoint combinator, the Y Combinator, for achieving recursive functions.

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 The author emphasizes the importance of shipping or completing something every day, whether it's in professional software development or personal projects. They clarify that shipping doesn't necessarily mean pushing code every day, but instead contributing something valuable, such as documentation or issue triage. The author suggests that regularly completing and sharing small tasks can provide several benefits.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that the frequent release of software, driven by an "ADHD-ish attitude," is detrimental to its quality. The author suggests that developers should take a step back, think deeply, and not feel pressured to ship code that barely works. The constant rush of seeing code being shipped leads to decreased ability for long-term attention. The addictive nature of being able to immediately see changes results in unproductive rapid iteration loops, where developers make random changes until something works. The focus on looking busy rather than actually working on tough problems is seen as problematic. The article also mentions the importance of maintaining a good commit streak on platforms like GitHub, but warns that optimizing for metrics alone is not effective and can be seen as mere showmanship. The author emphasizes that the satisfaction of completing a task is greater when one has persevered for a longer period of time.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes the practice of doing certain things for the wrong reasons. It argues that shipping incomplete features just to impress a manager is a sign of a toxic work environment. Similarly, filling up a GitHub profile with superficial displays is seen as a hollow gesture. The author, who has ADHD, suggests that they are content with learning, solving problems, and supporting their team without the added pressure of constantly shipping new things. The article concludes by advising readers to strive for progress but also to avoid burnout and not feel guilty if they don't achieve something every day.
