### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the advantages of electric vehicles (EVs), including their more spacious interiors due to the reduced footprint of their drivetrain. The author notes that 2023 is expected to be a big year for EVs, with a wider range of offerings available. The Tesla Model Y is currently the best-selling model of car, but the author is uncertain if this is a metric to hang one's hat on, as it may be a limited market. The author also questions the build quality of Tesla cars compared to a reliable car like the Corolla. The author predicts that the Model Y may keep its lead as the best-selling model due to Tesla's manufacturing ability and the surface appeal of the EV, but it may also lose its lead in the future.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

It compares the cost of a luxury vehicle like the Tesla Model Y, which costs twice as much as a Corolla, and notes that people in the service industry may not be able to afford a used Tesla. Additionally, it mentions that a used Corolla with high mileage can be purchased for around $5k, making it a more affordable option for some consumers.

## 4. [Layoffs push down scores on Glassdoor – how companies respond](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36081655)

**Total comment counts : 47**

### Summary

 Some tech companies are trying to improve their Glassdoor ratings after layoffs by flagging and removing negative reviews, and encouraging employees to post positive ones. While Glassdoor makes it clear that companies cannot remove reviews, this is technically possible if the review violates community guidelines or terms of use. Glassdoor prioritizes reviews flagged by paying customers, but successfully removed reviews that were rude and abusive. Companies can also increase their scores by responding to negative reviews, posting more reviews, and taking legal action. Some companies are encouraging employees to leave reviews in various ways, such as sending reminders during the first few months of employment or organizing review events. However, some companies employ questionable tactics to increase their scores, such as removing negative reviews and silencing employees.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article treats Glassdoor reviews like Amazon reviews and looks at the 1 and 2 stars to identify trends in negative reviews. They ignore reviews that seem to be only from "dumb" people, but take seriously those that show distinct trends of faulty things or failures to perform. They believe that 4 and 5-star reviews are often fake or manipulated and that companies use these high ratings to make sales. They also express a sense of resignation and suggest that there is not much to be done except to hope for a good employer.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author had used Glassdoor up until five years ago but stopped when they realized the company could manipulate reviews. About six years ago, the author was turned down for a job due to their speech impairment, which they then wrote about in a Glassdoor review. However, this review was not posted on the site, suggesting that reviews can be manipulated. The author advises seeking feedback through personal connections on LinkedIn instead.

## 5. [Amazon Backs Out of Climate Pledge, Deletes Shipment Zero Initiative Blogpost](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36078746)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Amazon has withdrawn from its commitment to make 50% of its shipments net-zero carbon by 2030, known as "Shipment Zero," and rolled the goal into a broader plan to reach net-zero carbon across all its operations by 2040. The move has led to concern, as the e-commerce giant is heavily reliant on fleets of vehicles and aircraft to sustain its fast delivery promise, which is a key selling point for shoppers. The company's agenda to reduce carbon emissions came under fire after an investigative report found that it had failed to count substantial portions of its carbon footprint.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The public transportation infrastructure around Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, which Amazon bought the naming rights for, is bad. As a result, the writer and their wife ended up parking nearby rather than taking the subway and monorail. This poses a problem as it is cheaper and easier to do so, which is not an ideal situation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article appears to be a deleted blog post from Amazon about their sustainability efforts. There is a reference to Amazon fighting against an emissions bill in Oregon despite their climate pledge. A link to a discussion on Hacker News is also included.

## 7. [Ask HN: How do you approach a problem you are not sure has a solution?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36057997)

**Total comment counts : 181**

### Summary

 The article suggests that before spending too much time trying to solve a problem, it is worth spending some time figuring out the quickest way to show that the solution may not work. This involves looking for statements that suggest that if X worked, then Y would work too, and testing Y to determine if X can work. While this may seem like a diversion in the moment, it can save a significant amount of time in the long run. Additionally, the article explores various examples of this approach, including testing a basic method on perfectly clean data before applying it to noisy data and testing simpler approaches to deal with noise before implementing more sophisticated noise models.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of "failing fast" which means finding the quickest way to show that something cannot possibly work. This involves looking for statements such as "if X worked, then Y would work too" and testing Y to determine if X works. Spending time on this can save individuals time and stop them from going down rabbit holes in their careers. It also helps alleviate anxiety about whether an idea is viable or not.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the negative effects of anxiety and paralysis on problem-solving. Anxiety leads to rumination which causes more anxiety and prevents seeking new information. To overcome this, individuals can trick themselves into acquiring more information or take a step back and look at anxiety as a problem to be solved, through treatments such as exercise and therapy. One strategy is to engage in curiosity-driven learning adjacent to the problem to gain more information and reduce antagonism towards the topic.

## 8. [That people produce HTML with string templates is telling us something](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36082180)

**Total comment counts : 61**

### Summary

 The article argues that while many people believe that producing HTML with string templates/interpolation is wrong, the enduring popularity of string templating suggests that people see it as having real advantages over their alternatives. The author suggests that instead of trying to displace string templating, it may be important to figure out what the current advantages are and how to duplicate them in alternatives. Despite this, the article also presents some ideas and pointers to ideas for building safe templates that is a great approach for anyone planning a new template language.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author emphasizes that if people consistently do something in a different way than what was intended, then it is the system or idea that should be reconsidered, not the people. The author finds it funny that this idea is in contrast with the responses in the thread.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how JSX is a beneficial feature in React as it is easier to read and understand compared to string templates used for HTML generation. The author suggests that incorporating a safe and readable HTML-generation feature similar to JSX in other languages can make people more enthusiastic about using it. Additionally, the article acknowledges the importance of syntactic sugar, citing Python's list comprehensions as an example of how it can make code more readable.

## 9. [Ford EV Customers to Gain Access to 12,000 Tesla Superchargers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36079236)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 Ford has agreed with Tesla to allow Ford electric vehicle customers access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the US and Canada, doubling the number of fast-chargers available to Ford EV customers starting spring 2024. A Tesla-developed adapter will provide direct access to Tesla’s V3 Superchargers to Ford F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E and E-Transit vehicles fitted with the Combined Charging System (CCS) port. Future Ford EVs will use the NACS charge port, which will provide direct access to Tesla Superchargers without an adapter, starting in 2025. The BlueOval Charge Network will include more than 96,000 chargers after Ford dealers add roughly 1,800 public-facing fast-chargers and locations to the network by early 2024.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Ford has announced that by 2025, its electric vehicles will have a North American Charging Standard connector built-in, which means that an adapter will not be necessary to access Tesla Superchargers. While it would be preferable for Tesla to add the CCS connector to their vehicles, this move by Ford could potentially push other automakers to adopt the Tesla connector in order to access their charging network.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that Ford is now the third-largest electric vehicle (EV) company in the US. Start-up companies like Lucid, Rivian, and Canoo will hold meetings to discuss this change. The decision to switch to the North American Classification System (NACS) could play a vital role in the success or failure of these companies. GM, on the other hand, is expected to dismiss this change until they see a significant impact on their EV sales.
