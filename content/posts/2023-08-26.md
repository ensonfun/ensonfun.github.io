## 2. [Deep Neural Nets: 33 years ago and 33 years from now (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37268610)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article is about the author's attempt to reproduce a historical paper on handwritten zip code recognition using neural networks. The original paper, published in 1989, applied backpropagation to train a neural network for this task. The author attempted to follow the paper closely and re-implemented it using PyTorch. They made several modifications and improvements to the original methodology, such as changing the loss function, using modern optimization algorithms, introducing data augmentation and dropout, and scaling up the dataset. Through these changes, they were able to significantly improve the performance of the network. The author reflects on the progress in deep learning over the past 33 years and discusses the trend towards finetuning and using foundation models. They conclude that in the future, training neural networks from scratch may become outdated, and tasks will be achieved through lightweight finetuning or interacting with larger neural networks directly.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that the original training for a system took 3 days on a Sun 4/260 workstation, which consumed about 200 watts of energy. The author then trained the equivalent on a Macbook, which only consumed around 20 watts of energy and took 90 seconds. This represents an energy efficiency improvement of nearly 30,000 times.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses predictions for the year 2055 related to technological advancements. The author appreciates the article but criticizes the predictions for being "meta-linear" and suggesting a symmetry between the present and future. The author acknowledges that these predictions may not come true due to unforeseen breakthroughs and obstacles. They propose that alternative architectural frameworks or quantum computers could shape the future. However, the author also concedes that the article's conclusions are the best estimations based on current knowledge of past and present situations.

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 Teamshares is a New York-based startup targeting small businesses without a succession plan and has acquired 84 small businesses since 2018. The company installs a new president that it trains and grants 10% of the business's stock to its employees, with the aim of increasing employee ownership to 80% within 20 years. Teamshares generates revenue by selling fintech products such as insurance and credit cards to the businesses it acquires. The company has raised $245 million in venture capital and $150 million in debt. Teamshares aims to replace the vendors used by the acquired companies and become a well-known brand outside its immediate sphere.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the difficulty of finding small businesses with growth potential. The author shares an example of a highly rated bakery owned by a couple who wanted to retire. However, all the profits of the bakery were taken as their salary, making it difficult to replace them without eating into the profits. The bakery faced stiff competition from 40 other local bakeries, and the absence of accurate auditing due to cash transactions made the situation even more challenging. The author expresses concerns about companies being bought by Teamshares, as employees could end up with a non-growing company that slowly deteriorates after the owners retire and Teamshares continues to extract fees.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a company that is primarily a holding company, rather than a fintech company.
