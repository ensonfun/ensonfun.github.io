## 10. [Why Does My eBPF Program Work on One Kernel but Fail on Another?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43769461)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 Inconsistent kernel versions complicate the portability of eBPF programs, as each version features unique kernel headers that can change struct definitions and memory layouts. This variability can prevent programs compiled on one version from running on another. To enhance portability, developers can utilize BPF CO-RE (Compile Once – Run Everywhere) by replacing BPF_PROBE_READ() with BPF_CORE_READ() to enable adaptable access to struct fields. This method relies on BPF CO-RE relocation information and BTF (BPF Type Format). However, successful execution requires that the target kernel is also compiled with BTF support.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Disregarding stable kernel data structures and APIs may simplify tasks for some developers but increases the maintenance burden for others, such as eBPF and driver developers. System modules should bear the burdens to support their users effectively. In contrast, some platforms, like iOS, frequently break user apps, imposing ongoing costs on thousands of developers, when a stable ABI could save significant resources for both developers and users.
