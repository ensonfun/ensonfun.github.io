## 1. [Terminal colours are tricky](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41727971)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The article discusses common challenges and solutions related to terminal color schemes. The author reflects on their long journey to find a satisfactory color scheme and gathers feedback from users on Mastodon. A major complaint highlighted is the difficulty of reading certain colors, such as "blue on black." The author explains that terminals use ANSI colors (16 basic colors) but that there is a lack of standardization across terminal emulators, leading to inconsistencies in color appearance.

To address these issues, the article suggests two primary solutions for customizing terminal colors: configuring the terminal emulator itself (most modern emulators support this) or running a shell script that uses ANSI escape codes to change colors dynamically. 

The author notes that many terminals support an extended 256-color set, allowing for more customization in different tools, albeit with the risk of clashes with the terminal's background. Examples of terminal tools are provided, such as `fd` and `bat`, showcasing how they manage color theming. Lastly, the article mentions specific problems some users have with the Solarized theme, particularly regarding color variations in different terminal applications.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses challenges in creating effective light color schemes for systems, highlighting two main observations:

1. Light themes are perceived more subtly than dark themes across different screens due to variations in hardware and software, making it crucial for designers to consider this when porting themes to diverse devices.

2. When using consoles with limited support for fonts and color (like Linux or BSD), certain tools (like `fd` or `exa`) can become unusable, complicating terminal work. The author struggled to implement `fbterm` for better terminal features without X, yet encountered its own set of issues. They emphasize the importance of having fallback themes for basic consoles or mastering command entry without visual cues.

Additionally, a screenshot of the author's customized `fbterm` setup is included as an example.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article advocates for improving terminal usability through two main steps: 

1. **Change the Default Color Scheme**: Most terminal emulators come with poor default color schemes. The author recommends using readable themes like Solarized (dark or light) but acknowledges that personal preferences may vary.

2. **Avoid CLI Tools Using Color Escape Codes**: The author believes CLI tools that utilize escape sequences for 8bit or 24bit colors by default are user-hostile, as they override the user's chosen color scheme. Instead, such color options should be optional and not the default setting.

By following these two steps, the author claims that users can create a more consistent and readable terminal environment with minimal configuration. They suggest that the real issue lies in promoting the use of color escape codes among developers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Matthew Charles Mullenweg shared insights from a lawsuit, revealing that Heather Brunner from WP Engine was interviewing for a position at Automattic, which explains their frequent one-on-one meetings. He noted that despite claims to the contrary, Brunner was interested in the role of Executive Director of WordPress.org, not in running WordPress.com, a position previously held by Josepha.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a "no forking" clause in a term sheet sent by Automattic to WP Engine, while referencing the implications of the WordPress license (GPLv2). This license states that any attempt to sublicense or distribute the software under different terms results in the forfeiture of one’s own license. The article points out that WordPress is a fork and does not have copyright assignments, preventing changes to the license by its creator, Matt. Consequently, it raises the question of whether WordPress.com can legally continue to use and distribute the WordPress software under these conditions.

## 4. [Patent troll Sable pays up, dedicates all its patents to the public](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41730415)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 In February 2024, Cloudflare celebrated a victory in a legal battle against patent trolls Sable IP and Sable Networks in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, marking the end of nearly three years of litigation. The conclusion sends a strong message to patent trolls: meritless claims will be met with resolute resistance. Additionally, Cloudflare announced further developments in Project Jengo, a public initiative aimed at identifying prior art to challenge patent trolls like Sable. This project has awarded over $125,000 since its launch in 2017.

Sable, which filed suit against Cloudflare in March 2021, is characterized as a patent troll—an entity that exploits patents without engaging in actual innovation or product development. It accused Cloudflare of infringing on patents acquired from a defunct router company, Caspian Networks, relating to outdated hardware technology. While several companies settled with Sable, Cloudflare pursued an aggressive defense, ultimately reducing Sable's claims to just one patent.

During the trial, Cloudflare presented evidence demonstrating that its modern software-defined services significantly differ from the outdated hardware technologies Sable's claims were based on. The court heard from Cloudflare engineer Eric Reeves and expert Dr. Paul Min, who provided clarity on the technical distinctions necessary to refute Sable's infringement claims. This legal victory reinforces Cloudflare’s commitment to combating unjust patent litigation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the low payout of $125,000 for Cloudflare's Project Jengo, which aims to reward individuals submitting prior art against patent claims. The author, a former patent examiner, notes that this amount is insufficient when divided among many submissions and suggests that the compensation is less appealing than a government job, such as a GS-7 patent examiner. They argue that Cloudflare needs to raise the bounties to compete with actual patent search firms and other better-paying positions to attract serious participants for their program.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes patent trolls, describing them as greedy and unproductive entities that waste legal resources without contributing to society. It commends the litigation team at Cloudflare for their efforts against them.

## 7. [Who Pays for the Arts?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41726452)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges facing nonprofit arts organizations in the U.S., particularly following the impending closure of the Lannan Foundation, which has been a significant supporter of small literary presses like Copper Canyon Press. Established in 1974, Copper Canyon Press has benefitted from the Lannan Foundation since its inception, receiving funding that has allowed it to champion underrepresented and experimental writers. However, with the Lannan Foundation's planned wind-down by 2032, organizations like Copper Canyon face drastic budget cuts and uncertainty about future funding. The piece emphasizes a broader "generosity crisis" in the arts sector, where a drop in corporate and charitable giving is causing instability. Arts leaders are now exploring innovative funding models—prioritizing collective approaches and viewing arts as part of a larger social ecosystem—contrasting the U.S. reliance on private philanthropy with the more government-supported arts funding found in Europe.

 In Belgium, artists can easily obtain the "artist-statute," which provides a subsidized monthly income. The country operates on a "subsidize-and-conquer" model, maintaining high taxes while keeping the lower class satisfied with welfare and the upper class with cultural and business subsidies. This leaves the middle class feeling squeezed. The art sector is predominantly publicly funded, which discourages critical voices among artists, preventing a strong anti-authoritarian culture. Despite the funding, the outcome is often mediocrity and low productivity among artists, rather than world-class talent.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the decline of cultural infrastructure and its impact on the arts, referencing the books "Culture Crash" and "Big Fiction." It highlights how, in the past, poets were once widely read and culturally relevant, capable of generating conversations outside academic circles. However, over the years, literature has become heavily tied to universities, limiting opportunities for writers and leading to an insular environment. This trend is mirrored in other creative industries, such as music and art, where previous avenues for support and expression have dwindled. The current crisis in nonprofit funding for the arts is positioned as part of this broader, ongoing decline.

## 8. [Type-erased generic functions for C: A modest non-proposal](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41697588)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses implementing parametric polymorphism in C akin to methodologies seen in languages like Swift. It introduces a proposal, N3212, which suggests a new primitive type called _Type, designed to carry metadata about types. This metadata would facilitate the creation of generic functions in C, handling complexities such as type size and alignment. 

The author highlights the challenges of creating a metadata system that is both comprehensive enough to cater to different use cases without becoming overly complex or bloated. There's an emphasis on exploring a hybrid approach that combines type-erasure with default arguments to gather relevant metadata, aiming for a design that aligns with the "spirit of C." The author asserts that generic functions could still be feasible in a form similar to incomplete types, allowing for flexibility while maintaining compatibility with existing C practices.

The author acknowledges their role isn't to formally propose these ideas but hopes to inspire others in the systems language design community to consider innovative alternatives to traditional polymorphism in C.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses a preference for using stricter C++ syntax instead of introducing new syntax in C, particularly regarding templated functions and passing size information in function calls. The author reminisces about past efforts to standardize these practices and remarks on the effectiveness of existing routines in C codebases for handling generic types. They suggest that the new proposed syntax offers minimal improvement and assert that projects, like those at Linux and Apple, are likely to prefer broader annotations beyond just size or alignment.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential for modernizing C code, highlighting that while new code can be written in any language, existing C code is prevalent. It suggests that improvements to tools like GNU Make could be beneficial but are limited by the need for compatibility with older compilers, such as those used by VMS users. To effectively modernize C programs, the article proposes transpiling modern features back to C89, which could ensure compatibility across various platforms that may not support newer compilers.

 The author shares insights from their experience of engaging in daily online arguments over six months, asserting that productive discussions are more common than perceived. They argue that people generally engage in good faith but often misunderstand each other due to different communication styles. The article emphasizes that responding to insults with curiosity and a genuine desire to understand promotes constructive dialogue, rather than using insults or defensive tactics, which only escalate conflicts.

The author illustrates their points through an example of an interaction where a misunderstanding occurred, highlighting that signaling vulnerability and articulating confusion can diffuse anger and foster understanding. They also offer to analyze examples of perceived bad faith arguments, encouraging a more thoughtful approach to communication that prioritizes understanding over scoring points in debates. Overall, the piece advocates for civil engagement online by emphasizing the importance of empathy in discussions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author argues that the primary focus in an internet argument should be on influencing the uninvolved audience rather than trying to change the mind of the direct opponent. The author believes that even if convincing the opponent is unlikely, swaying the onlookers can be a significant outcome of the discussion.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of having constructive conversations online and understanding differing viewpoints, suggesting that this is more critical than current political issues. The author expresses frustration over contradictions within the text, pointing out that while it mentions misconceptions about good faith discussions only occurring in close-knit groups, it also implies that having a good faith discussion is an expectation. The author argues that genuine, good faith arguments are quite rare on the internet, countering the notion that they can happen broadly outside of intimate communities.

## 10. [Image Editing with Gaussian Splatting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41729891)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 A new collaboration between researchers from Poland and the UK has developed a system called MiraGe, which utilizes Gaussian Splatting to enable 2D image editing through temporary 3D representation. This allows users to manipulate aspects of an image in 3D space before applying the changes. The process is reminiscent of various modal techniques in Adobe software, where the interface temporarily locks to complete complex actions.

MiraGe uses a physics engine to interpret natural movements for static alterations or animations. Unlike existing AI systems like Adobe's Firefly, MiraGe does not incorporate generative AI or Latent Diffusion Models; instead, it creates a mirror image of selected areas and approximates 3D coordinates for manipulation. The authors claim this method aligns more closely with human visual interpretation and allows intuitive edits that capture subtle nuances.

The system employs Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS), a technique that transforms 2D images into temporary 3D meshes, enabling traditional CGI modification techniques. The process involves two symmetrical cameras to enhance the fidelity of the reflections and facilitate easier perspective adjustments. The findings, published in the paper "MiraGe: Editable 2D Images using Gaussian Splatting," demonstrate MiraGe’s potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image editing compared to previous methods. The complete code is available on GitHub.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of converting a single image into a usable 3D modeling format, highlighting that this process is a significant leap rather than a minor step. It points out that traditional 3D graphics systems (3DGS) usually require multiple viewpoints, similar to photogrammetry, which makes creating accurate models from single images more complex.
