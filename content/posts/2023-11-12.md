## 2. [HTML First](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38241304)

**Total comment counts : 80**

### Summary

 The article discusses the principles of HTML First, which aims to make building web software easier, faster, more inclusive, and more maintainable. The main goal is to widen the pool of web programmers, making it more accessible and increasing income opportunities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article wanted to create a Linux version of a tool similar to vimium, which provides keyboard shortcuts in any application. They created a prototype using the AT-SPI2 accessibility API, but found that querying the API for all buttons was too slow in complex apps. Additionally, many apps, especially non-GTK ones, either implemented accessibility poorly or not at all. As a result, the author abandoned the project. They considered making a framework-specific implementation by modifying the GTK shared library but deemed it too much effort and lost interest in the mouseless concept altogether.

## 6. [Speaker Support in Asahi Linux](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38239503)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article provides an update on the speaker support of Asahi Linux. The platform aims to offer the best speaker support for Linux laptops and has undergone a multi-year development effort. The speaker support is currently available on Asahi Fedora Remix, and although there may be bugs and room for improvement, alternative distros should be able to integrate this work easily. The article also mentions that the DSP processing currently consumes too much power but will be improved with an upcoming release. The goal is to provide a balanced sound and offer customization options for users. The article also mentions the implementation of an open-source "smart amp" that monitors feedback signals and adjusts speaker volumes for safety. Users are advised to be cautious when using the speakers at maximum volume. Overall, the speaker support on Asahi Linux is being continuously developed and improved.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of Easy Effects for digital signal processing (DSP). It mentions that while Easy Effects can be used for DSP, it is not suitable for distribution. The main challenge is obtaining the correct impulse-response data, which typically requires professional equipment and a recording studio. However, it is suggested that Dolby may be using the same profile for all laptops, allowing for a copy-paste approach. The article also mentions that Asahi can ship DSP turned on by default because its distribution is specific to Apple, which helps enhance the quality of their hardware. The article provides two references for further information on Easy Effects and Linux support for Dolby Advanced Audio v2.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Asahi's introduction of a new advanced speaker DSP technology to Linux. The significance of this development is highlighted, and the author predicts that it will likely be incorporated into other Linux distributions in the future.
