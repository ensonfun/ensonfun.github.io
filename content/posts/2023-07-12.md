## 1. [Vale's first prototype for immutable region borrowing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36690556)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 The article discusses the development of a new memory safety approach called Vale, which uses generational references and region borrowing to eliminate the need for reference counting, tracing garbage collection, or borrow checking. The author explains how the approach evolved from initial ideas and describes the challenges faced in implementing it, including the need for full generics and a new compiler stage. However, after several years of work, the author was able to create the first zero-check Vale program, demonstrating that the approach is both fast and memory safe. The author acknowledges that there is still work to be done before Vale can compete with languages like C and C++, but is optimistic about the potential for Vale to offer a new approach to memory safety in software development. The article also includes information on how to support the development of Vale through GitHub sponsorship.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author tried to use Vale, but encountered multiple issues. The compiler panicked when no arguments were given, there was no basic help for command-line parameters, and the "hello world" sample code did not build properly. Additionally, the help command provided no useful information, leaving the author frustrated.

## 2. [Proof you can do hard things](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36674076)

**Total comment counts : 72**

### Summary

 The article argues that the main reason for learning calculus or any other hard subject is not because of its practical application in adult life or future career, but to prove to oneself that they can do hard things. The ability to do difficult things is a valuable asset, and it helps build one's self-image and confidence, making it easier to tackle future challenges. The author also suggests that parents should encourage their children to do hard things, but not necessarily in school subjects. Instead, children should be encouraged to pursue projects or activities that challenge them and help build mental callouses.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues against the common phenomenon where people request reasons for "why you should care about math." The author believes that only math has to justify itself in this manner while other school subjects do not. They claim to have learned many things in school that they never used, and see no reason why mathematics, especially calculus, should have to justify its existence.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that people who say math is unnecessary outside of certain careers are mistaken. Math is a powerful tool for modeling the world, from simple calculations like measuring the right amount of fence for a garden to complex data science and machine learning. The writer suggests that math opens doors to highly paid careers and helps in day to day life. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance and usefulness of math beyond just career choices.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their gratitude for emulation, which allowed them to play old games on now obsolete platforms, since they grew up in a country where game consoles were unaffordable for the middle class. The author sees the legal precedent set two decades ago as a "big win" for the judiciary and hopes it never goes away.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is amazed that the complex and powerful architecture of the PS3 has been largely emulated. They grew up with the PS3 and remember how impressive it was, even being used by the US Air Force for super computing. The author believes that in the future, it will be possible to emulate the PS5 on a computer, potentially easier due to its simpler architecture.

## 4. [Introduction to vector similarity search (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36673714)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article introduces the concept of vector search, also known as vector similarity search or nearest neighbor search, which is used in data and information retrieval systems to find items or data points that are similar or closely related to a given query vector. Vector search represents data points such as images, texts, and audio as vectors in high-dimensional space and uses distance metrics like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity to measure the similarity between vectors. The article also covers word embeddings as an example of vector search and various methods for nearest neighbor search such as linear search, space partitioning, quantization, and approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. Finally, the article discusses common similarity metrics such as L1 and L2 distances and cosine similarity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is seeking a recommendation for a good stack to calculate text embeddings using open-source or local methods, store them in a vector database, and running vector similarity search using open-source or local methods. They are also asking for advice on how granular the text chunks should be. They want to avoid using Langchain and are interested in hearing from others who have achieved reliable results from similar endeavors.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article questions the practice of normalizing embeddings, as it eliminates the ability to distinguish between words with similar meanings but different magnitudes. For example, without the use of scaling, the nearest neighbor to "big * 10" would be "huge" or "enormous", but with scaling, it becomes impossible to distinguish between them. The author wonders whether this is worth giving up the power of scalars, but acknowledges that there may be reasons for the normalization practice that they are not aware of. They invite professionals in the field to comment on the subject.

## 5. [TimeMaps (2017)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36692450)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses how public transportation in the Netherlands has made distance irrelevant and people now think in terms of time instead. This perspective affects the shape of the country on a map, with cities appearing closer together. However, the time of day also plays a role in how large or small the country appears due to the schedule of trains. The article mentions the nomination of the map design for various awards and publications.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the public transportation system in the Netherlands, emphasizing that the country's good public transportation has made distance irrelevant. However, due to Covid-19, there have been drastic cuts in bus lines, which has led to the creation of on-call buses that can be reserved in advance but may be difficult to catch if other forms of transportation are delayed. The article suggests that public transportation, including trains, is not in a good position in the Netherlands due to Covid-19 and a car-focused government.

## 6. [Birds make nests out of anti-bird pins](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36689463)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 Researchers from Naturalis Biodiversity Center and the Natural History Museum Rotterdam have discovered bird nests made entirely of anti-bird spikes in the Netherlands, Belgium and Scotland. The discovery was made after magpies built impregnable fortress-like structures using the pins, which they usually steal from building eaves, to keep eggs and young safe from other birds. The behaviour has already been noted in crows, which used spikes in one of their nests found in the Netherlands. The research scientists said the behaviour was the latest example of the adaptability and creativity of urban birds in the face of new challenges.

## 8. [Intel exiting the PC business as it stops investment in the Intel NUC](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36680674)

**Total comment counts : 233**

### Summary

 Intel has announced that it will stop direct investment in its Next Unit of Compute (NUC) business and instead rely on industry partners to continue innovation and growth in the NUC ecosystem. Intel NUCs are mini PCs that have served as everything from desktops to portable enterprise software cluster nodes. Despite being popular, the line of PCs is being sunset as Intel focuses on streamlining its business. This follows Intel's sale of its server business and a change in position with regard to competing with OEM customers earlier this year.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Intel has confirmed that they will cease production of their NUCs (Next Unit of Computing) products. This news comes after Intel had announced it was to exit the server systems business, which the author of the article had predicted three months ago. The writer also felt that Intel needed to focus more on core business, such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs and networking rather than side projects. The author expresses disappointment at the end of NUC production but feels it was inevitable given their difficult partnerships with customers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article reports that the Intel NUCs had adequate technical documentation, which is rare in the computer industry. With many smaller, innovative computers lacking documentation and often having manufacturing problems, the Intel NUCs will be missed, especially since there are no good alternatives for computers of similar size and power.

## 9. [Breaking java.lang.String](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36687970)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses a bug in the String class in Java that can be exploited to create strange Strings. This is due to a race condition in the String constructor that can result in a String that only contains latin-1 characters but is encoded as UTF-16. The article describes how this bug can be used to create non-equal Strings that contain the same character sequence and even break String literals at a distance. The article also presents a challenge to create a Java String that is empty but not equal to the empty String literal, using only public APIs. The article concludes with some interesting solutions submitted to the challenge by readers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The default assumption in Java is that types are not thread-safe unless explicitly mentioned. If you use them in a way that exceeds their documented thread safety, it may leave your program in an inconsistent state.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that calling the "bug in java.lang.String" silly is inaccurate as the same bug exists for other functions that use mutable objects. The bug is not caused by the innocent user of the mutable object but by the other code that introduces the data race in the first place. It suggests that languages like Rust with borrow systems or linear types can eliminate this issue. Furthermore, it compares the problem to claiming that there is a bug in the `printf("Hello, World!\n");` code in C because there could be another thread writing random values to random memory.

## 10. [Chiplet ASIC supercomputers for LLMs like GPT-4](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36690320)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article cannot be accessed at the moment and there is a link provided for more information on how to restore access.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that a paper claiming to be 300x faster than an A100 at serving GPT-3 uses incorrect numbers for how fast A100s can run GPT-3, and they misread the DeepSpeed Inference paper. The claimed TCO advantage is overstated and may be reduced to 6.2x or even 3x. Also, the article suggests that the cost of the chip design itself is likely to be underestimated.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the architectural features necessary for achieving large generative language models and the importance of fitting all model parameters inside the on-chip SRAMs of the chiplets to eliminate bandwidth limitations. This design choice offers better read latency and read/write energy but requires careful consideration of chiplet die size, memory capacity, and total number of chiplets to balance fabrication cost and model performance. Inter-chiplet communication issues can be mitigated through software-hardware co-design, such as tensor and pipeline model parallelism.
