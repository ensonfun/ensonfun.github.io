## 1. [Voyager 1 is back online! NASA spacecraft returns data from all 4 instruments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40687660)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, which experienced technical issues in November 2023, has resumed full science operations. The spacecraft, which is 46 years old and located 15 billion miles away from Earth, lost its ability to communicate effectively but has now fixed the problem. The team identified that the flight data subsystem was causing the issue and implemented a workaround. Initially, only two of Voyager 1's four science instruments were sending usable data, but now all four instruments are fully operational. Voyager 1's primary mission was to study Jupiter and Saturn, which was accomplished by 1980. The spacecraft entered interstellar space in 2012 and continues to provide valuable data. NASA will continue to optimize Voyager 1's performance and maintain its functionality.

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses the discovery of the skull of Genyornis newtoni, one of the largest birds that ever existed. The skull provides insight into how the bird lived and reveals that it was a giant goose. Genyornis newtoni lived more than 45,000 years ago in ancient Australia but went extinct shortly after humans arrived, likely due to being eaten and climate change. The skull was found at Lake Callabonna in South Australia, and its discovery sheds light on the bird's diet, appearance, and behavior. The closest living relative of Genyornis newtoni is the horned screamer.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the extinction of Genyornis, a large bird species, shortly after humans arrived. The main cause of their extinction is believed to be overhunting by humans, with climate change also playing a role. The article questions why the birds survived through previous periods of climate change but couldn't survive the arrival of humans.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 6. [Perplexity AI is lying about their user agent](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40690898)

**Total comment counts : 66**

### Summary

 The author discusses their experience with blocking AI bots on their server and on their website, MacStories. Despite implementing blocking measures, they find that Perplexity AI is still able to access their site and provide a summary of a specific blog post. The author questions how this is possible and realizes that Perplexity AI is not respecting the robots.txt file and is not sending the correct user agent string. The author expresses frustration and explores potential actions they can take, such as filing a bug report and considering GDPR requests.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two concerns regarding the use of Perplexity, a language model, in relation to user data. The first concern is whether it is possible to prevent Perplexity from training itself using personal data. The second concern is whether Perplexity can access and present website data based on user request, which raises questions about banning this activity. The article argues that various tools, such as ad blockers and screen readers, perform similar functions to Perplexity, and blocking its use would be inconsistent with the use of these tools. The author argues against the use of DRM (Digital Rights Management) to restrict the way websites are displayed, stating a desire for the ability to customize website presentations. They also express discomfort with labeling the use of Perplexity as unethical, as long as it properly cites the source.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article points out that website owners should not restrict users from accessing their sites with different browsers, including Perplexity. It suggests that when retrieving a webpage for the user, it is acceptable to use a user agent (UA) string that appears as a browser client. However, if Perplexity is collecting training data without using a UA, it should cease doing so. The article fails to provide evidence of this claim.

## 7. [Leveraging Zig's Allocators](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40682863)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the development of an HTTP server library for the programming language Zig. The author explores the challenges faced when handling dynamic content and the need for an allocator to manage memory efficiently. The solution proposed involves the use of an ArenaAllocator, which automatically frees memory when it is no longer needed. The author also introduces the concept of a FixedBufferAllocator, which allows for the reuse of allocated memory, resulting in improved performance. These explicit allocators simplify resource management and enhance server performance in Zig.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses using the `fba.reset()` call in between requests. It also mentions the benefits of the opaque allocator system, which allows for the creation of customized wrappers. The example given is using the standard library json parser, which creates an arena for allocating memory, and returns a wrapper with a `deinit` method to free the allocated memory. The article emphasizes the flexibility of choosing different allocators, such as stack allocators or other arenas, depending on the specific requirements.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses an issue with Zig allocators where the memory from the arena is getting reused without clearing it. This can lead to memory corruption and the leaking of previously freed memory. The article suggests that even without process isolation between workers, one can still prevent memory corruption by placing memory arenas far apart in virtual memory and implementing other safety measures.

## 8. [H.264 Is Magic (2016)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40681306)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses the importance of video compression in reducing bandwidth required for transmission. It highlights the features and efficiency of H.264, a video compression codec standard. The author explains the concept of lossy compression, where less important bits are discarded to save space. H.264 uses various techniques to discard unnecessary detail information in frames, resulting in significantly smaller file sizes compared to lossless codecs like PNG. The article also introduces the concept of information entropy and its role in representing and describing datasets with minimal number of bits.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the increasing use and adoption of the AV1 video codec for various applications. Meta is gradually using VP9 and AV1 streams for video streaming, while AV1 is being utilized for video calls by Facebook. Microsoft is also starting to implement AV1 in Teams, specifically for screen sharing. Although H.264 will still be present for a while, AV1 is expected to become the new standard for internet video.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentioned is titled "H.264 is Magic" and it has been discussed multiple times on the Hacker News forum. There are several links provided that lead to different discussions of the article over the years, with varying amounts of comments.
