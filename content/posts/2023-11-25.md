### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been actively enforcing actions against cryptocurrencies. They have initiated about two or three cases per month and have already started 30 cases this year. Initially, they focused on scams and later targeted the ICO industry by questioning the lack of security registrations for each ICO. They have also taken action against NFT issuers and paid influencers. Recently, they have turned their attention to larger exchanges. In addition to these cases, there have been instances of fraud involving the misappropriation of funds for personal luxury items. The SEC holds the position that crypto should be treated similarly to other financial products, and this argument is widely accepted after the FTX case. The SEC emphasizes that the scams in the crypto space are not original, as they involve Ponzi schemes, pump and dump schemes, front-running, insider trading, and theft of customer assets, all of which have been known for a long time.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article highlights the issue of the "publish or perish" mindset in academia, where researchers are pressured to continuously publish papers regardless of their quality. The author argues that this dynamic leads to a flood of low-quality publications and calls for a reduction in the number of such papers. The article also mentions the unreliability of peer review as a filter for detecting fraud. Overall, the author believes that the current number of publications is significantly higher than necessary.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of using zero copy networking with io_uring to send the same bytes repeatedly. This could be useful for scenarios where data, such as updates in a video game, needs to be sent to multiple clients. By creating a fixed buffer, the data can be reused between calls in the ring, eliminating the need to copy it each time. However, there may be contention from locking involved, which could impact scalability. It suggests potential solutions, such as using per core buffers in the kernel, although control over kernel threads is uncertain.
