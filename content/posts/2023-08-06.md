## 3. [Replace peer review with “peer replication” (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37021264)

**Total comment counts : 53**

### Summary

 The article proposes replacing traditional peer review with a process called "peer replication" in order to address the lack of replication in many scientific fields. Instead of sending manuscripts to anonymous referees for review, preprints would be sent to other labs to replicate the findings. The results of the replication attempts would be included in the published paper, and the researchers who undertook the replication work would be credited. The article argues that this approach would incentivize replication, promote collaboration among colleagues, reduce fraud, and improve the overall quality of scientific research. However, there are potential challenges and considerations, such as the additional time it may take between submission and publication, addressing failed replications, and preventing authors from submitting rejected manuscripts to other journals. The article suggests that an organization like Review Commons could organize a trial of this approach. Overall, the author believes that peer replication would lead to better science and make papers vetted only by peer review less credible.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the difficulty of replicating scientific papers and the time-consuming nature of the process. It points out that non-scientists often underestimate the amount of work required to replicate published papers. Although the time needed varies depending on the field, replicating a paper can take months of effort. While some time is saved by not repeating dead ends and by receiving samples, replicating a paper still requires significant effort, especially if there are issues that need to be troubleshooted. The article also mentions that this work does not directly benefit the scientists replicating the paper; it only costs them time and money. However, if someone wants to build on the research and cares enough about it, they will replicate it anyway. This indirectly supports the original paper, even if subsequent papers do not specifically replicate the results. However, if replication attempts fail, it is more challenging to publish negative results, as creating a solid negative result requires more work than simply trying the experiments and abandoning them if they are not promising.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the purpose of science publications, which is to share new results with other scientists for the advancement of scientific progress. It explains how the process of publication has evolved from an informal mailing system to the establishment of formal journals. Peer review, where experts in the field review and validate papers, became an essential part of the publication process. However, the article points out that the focus on publication as a metric for measuring the productivity of scientists has distorted the original purpose of sharing results. The author suggests that instead of criticizing the occasional incorrect intermediate results, efforts should be made to improve the promotion metrics and maintain the efficient sharing process.

## 10. [Memex is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37020001)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of memex, a hypertext system proposed by Vannevar Bush in 1945. Memex was designed as a memory expansion device, allowing users to store and link documents, annotations, and records. While the World Wide Web and HTML were influenced by the concept of memex, they are not an accurate representation of Bush's original vision. The article explores various projects that aim to create a modern version of memex, but emphasizes the importance of interoperability and working with existing tools and software. The author suggests that creating a shared folder and organizing documents within it can serve as a practical memex trail, allowing for easy collaboration and efficient knowledge management. The article concludes by highlighting the benefits of creating a memex system and encourages readers to build their own using available software and a personalized system of organization.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses three main features of the Memex that are currently lacking in existing technologies. The first feature is annotation, which allows users to mark up hypertext documents. While HTML claims to support annotation, it does not allow for document modification once it's read-only. The second feature is the ability to edit and extend annotations, which includes actions like highlighting, circling, and attaching links. The third feature is trails, which enables the storage of a sequence of annotations and linking different parts of multiple documents. Lastly, the article mentions the ability to publish and share collections of documents, but acknowledges that implementing this feature would likely face opposition from copyright holders. The author suggests the possibility of creating a proxy system that records all local HTTP(s) traffic and keeps only the tagged or linked sources after a certain period, but notes that it would face challenges due to copyright concerns.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the need to adapt a method of working with documents called linking around. It highlights that the average person, who primarily uses a PC for work and some personal activities, would not be interested in this method that involves complex linking and multiple colors. The author criticizes the cult-like behavior of the proponents of this method and argues that it will never become mainstream, even among technical skilled people. The article concludes by stating that while passion and a real need for this method exist, it has not gained widespread adoption in decades.
