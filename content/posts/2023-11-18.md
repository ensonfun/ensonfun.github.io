## 6. [New York may ban noncompete employment agreements and Wall Street is not happy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38316870)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 Approximately 1 in 5 American workers, or nearly 30 million people, are currently bound by noncompete agreements, according to the Federal Trade Commission. These agreements are no longer limited to corporate executives but are increasingly being required for regular workers as well. A bill was passed in New York last June to ban noncompete agreements, but its implementation is yet to be determined. Business groups, including the Public Policy Institute of the State of New York and Wall Street firms, have fiercely opposed the legislation, seeing noncompete agreements as crucial for protecting investment strategies and retaining highly-paid workers. Advocates of the ban argue that it will support worker mobility and innovation. Other states such as California already ban noncompete agreements, while some have laws that nullify them if a person is laid off. The Federal Trade Commission has also proposed a regulation to ban noncompete agreements at the federal level. Critics of the New York bill claim it should not apply to certain industries or job levels and worry it may lead to job relocation in states without similar laws. Proponents argue that the bill will give employees more flexibility and agency in considering other employment opportunities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that noncompete agreements can make sense in the field of quantitative trading firms, as it is an industry that heavily relies on intellectual property (IP) and offers high salaries. However, the author identifies two main issues with noncompetes: they are given to a wide range of employees, not just those involved with IP, and they only pay base salary, not the full compensation amount. Despite this, the author concludes that noncompete agreements are relatively unimportant and that it would be better to ban them entirely rather than implement loopholes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that California's ban on noncompete agreements was not an intentional policy choice, but rather a result of jurist David Dudley Field II drafting a code of laws that included a provision banning noncompetes. Although his model code was not accepted by New York, it happened to be on hand when California was becoming a state, leading to the state adopting the provision. North Dakota also adopted the Field Code and subsequently bans noncompetes.

## 7. [Starship Integrated Flight Test 2 at 7 Am Central Time](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38317247)

### Summary

 The article describes the process of SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft approaching and docking with the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft undergoes a series of burns to gradually move closer to the ISS, followed by final docking maneuvers. After docking, the vestibule is pressurized, the hatch is opened, and the crew enters the ISS. The article also mentions the steps involved in launching the Dragon spacecraft, including separation from the Falcon 9 rocket's first and second stages, activation and checks of various systems, and performing orbit raising maneuvers to catch up with the ISS. The process concludes with the spacecraft establishing a communication link with the ISS, autonomous approach, final docking, and subsequent pressurization, hatch opening, and crew ingress.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 SpaceX's Starship got close to reaching orbit, with only a slight miss. The booster was destroyed during hot staging, but the upper stage destruct system fired towards the end of the burn. Despite the booster mishap, it was still a clean launch and separation, with no engine issues during ascent.

## 8. [GTK: Introducing Graphics Offload](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38316953)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The GTK team has been exploring the use of dmabufs in Linux kernel graphics APIs. Dmabufs are memory buffers in kernel space that can be passed between kernel subsystems without having to copy pixel data. However, there are complexities involved, such as managing device memory and multiple buffers. GTK has been using dmabufs since version 4.0, but now they are working on optimizing the use of dmabufs for frequently changing content. They aim to avoid copying pixel data and feeding it through the GTK compositing pipeline, which would improve performance and reduce power consumption, especially on mobile systems. With the help of Wayland subsurfaces, GTK can pass dmabufs directly to the compositor, either stacking them above the main surface or below with a translucent hole. This offloading process is automated by GTK, and an upcoming release will introduce a widget specifically for offloading content. The article mentions that dmabuf support in GStreamer will be improved in the upcoming 1.24 release. However, it's important to note that graphics offload with dmabufs is currently only supported on Wayland in Linux.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that it would be beneficial for Linux developers in the graphics kernel, GTK, KDE, Wayland, and other areas to collaborate and discuss requirements in order to create a more efficient and transparent graphics architecture. They believe that while different graphics systems can coexist, it is unnecessary for each team to independently discover how to handle existing components. By coordinating work at the requirements and architecture level, the author believes that there could be significant synergies achieved. They suggest that once the architecture is established, individual teams can implement it in a way that best suits their needs, while still relying on common elements.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that to make the game more enjoyable, it would be interesting to have scenarios interact with each other. Currently, the scenarios occur independently, but allowing one user's scenario to disrupt another person's situation could add a fun and unexpected element. This would add a unique twist and keep the game engaging.

## 10. [LMAX Disruptor – High Performance Inter-Thread Messaging Library](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38313457)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Disruptor, a concurrency framework developed by LMAX Exchange. The framework is designed to achieve low-latency and high-throughput performance in a Java platform. It eliminates the use of queues to pass data between stages of a system, as performance testing showed that this approach introduced latency. The Disruptor is a general-purpose mechanism for concurrent programming and is not limited to financial applications. It is a lock-free framework that takes into account cache misses at the CPU-level and avoids costly locks requiring kernel arbitration. The article provides various resources such as a User Guide, technical paper, performance tests, blogs, and articles to help users understand and utilize the Disruptor. Additionally, it mentions the positive review of the Disruptor's application at LMAX by Martin Fowler.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of tail latency with the LMAX disruptor and similar data structures. It emphasizes that these structures are designed to be used with thread-per-core systems, where there is no preemption during a critical section. If the application's threading is not designed in the intended way, it can result in poor tail latency. The article warns against using thread-per-request models with these data structures as it can lead to problematic outcomes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is working on a C version of the disruptor ringbuffer, which is designed to reduce latency and prevent false sharing. They have achieved latencies as low as 50 nanoseconds and have created versions for single and multiple producers. The author is also working on implementing the actor model for communication and developing a non-blocking, lock-free barrier with low latency.
