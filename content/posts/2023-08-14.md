### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author worked in Natural Language Processing (NLP) from 2014 to 2020. Initially, the Naive Bayes (NB) model was commonly used as a baseline, but the author found that Facebook's FastText model was generally a better choice when the training set contained more than a few hundred samples. FastText had higher accuracy and better generalizability due to word embeddings acting as a bottleneck. It was trained with cross-entropy, allowing for more effective use of model scores as confidence measures. Additionally, FastText's linear nature made it highly explainable. The article concludes by noting that there may be newer and better models in NLP since the author last focused on the topic.

## 5. [Show HN: Little Rat – Chrome extension monitors network calls of all extensions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37119942)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article seems to provide a link to a small Chrome extension that is designed to monitor network calls made by other extensions.

## 7. [Things Unix can do atomically (2010)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37117291)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 This article discusses the various capabilities of UNIX-like/POSIX-compliant operating systems that can be used to build thread-safe and multi-process-safe programs without the need for locks. The author emphasizes the importance of letting the kernel handle the work and trusts the kernel developers to do a better job than themselves. The list of atomic operations is not exhaustive and is expected to be updated regularly. However, the author notes that these operations are best suited for local filesystems and caution should be exercised when using them on NFS mounts. The article also provides contact information for reporting any issues or suggestions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the rename system call in Linux is not entirely atomic. In cases where the file is being overwritten, there is a possibility that both the oldpath and newpath will temporarily refer to the file being renamed. Instead, the rename operation can be thought of as two atomic operations performed in sequence. First, an atomic link call is made to make the file available under the new name, and then an atomic remove operation is performed to delete the old name. As a result, it is possible to observe the state after the link call but before the remove operation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a list of demands on file system design from the perspective of user land code. The author believes that the kernel should do most of the work, as kernel developers are more trustworthy and it is inefficient to lock around an already atomic operation. The article also points out that some of the demands outlined in the POSIX standards are costly to meet in a distributed, networked filesystem and can negatively impact performance.
