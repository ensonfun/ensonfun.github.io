---### 1. [The end of the accounting search](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36021197) Total comment counts : 29
**Summary**: LWN.net has stopped using proprietary software for its accounting needs. The Quickbooks system used until then had various problems, such as regular forced updates, frequent crashes, and arbitrary limits forcing users to upgrade. After considering alternatives since 2007, LWN finally switched to GnuCash. While this tool isn't perfect, it meets LWN's basic accounting needs and has a reasonably capable graphical interface. There are a number of unfinished aspects of GnuCash, such as lack of support for multi-user access and some features. However, GnuCash can be used to print checks using almost any format, which is important for businesses. LWN's accountant sees no issues with the transition and believes the reports generated from GnuCash will suffice.
**Top 1 Comment Summary**: The author, a QuickBooks ProAdvisor for over 20 years, believes that Intuit is determined to force its customers to migrate to the online version of their program, despite some customers' preferences for the Desktop version, which is faster and can do more. The author also criticizes Intuit for throwing major updates at the online version that hide or move functionality, making it confusing for users. Additionally, Intuit's annual price increases feel like an attempt to price customers out of their product. The author worries that Intuit's recent decisions demonstrate a lack of loyalty to customers and could lead them to find a new way to support themselves.
**Top 2 Comment Summary**: The article discusses the author's decision to switch from QuickBooks to GnuCash due to increasing costs for the software. They argue that reports of frequent crashes and lost work are not accurate, as QuickBooks uses transaction logging to protect against such issues. However, the author is not willing to pay the $800 annual subscription cost for the Accountant's version, particularly as they use the software less for professional use. As a result, they have started the migration process to GnuCash.

### 2. [Writing Python like it's Rust](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36018621) Total comment counts : 47
**Summary**: The author explains how their experience with Rust has influenced their Python programming, particularly in terms of using type hints and creating strongly-typed objects with named parameters to prevent undefined behavior and bugs. The author argues that using type hints forces programmers to think about the actual interface of a function and to make it as strict as possible, while creating strongly-typed objects with named parameters provides clear descriptions of what functions return and what their attributes are, improving productivity and reducing the need for manual code modification. The author also praises algebraic data types (ADTs) in Rust as a powerful tool to avoid runtime errors, but notes that they are less necessary in dynamically typed languages like Python.
**Top 1 Comment Summary**: The article addresses comments stating that typing in Python is subpar and that another language should be used for typing. However, the article argues that Python is not meant to be the best at one specific thing, but rather good at many things. Python offers optional typing with decent safety, making it versatile for quick scripting, exploring, designing seriously, and committing a public API into a file. Despite the rough edges of Python's typing system and match/case, using Python for its versatility keeps opportunities on the table for any project. The author finds themselves coming back to Python time and time again because it handles vast fields and unknown problems decently. Although Python is quirky, it is still practical and offers immense value to users.
**Top 2 Comment Summary**: The author expresses frustration with the type hinting system in Python 3, and compares it unfavorably to other languages like C++, C#, or TypeScript. They wish that Python had built-in features such as types, generics, abstract classes, enums, and interfaces, instead of having to import them from modules. The author also finds the numerous ways of doing things in Python to be overwhelming for new developers. Although the author loves Python and uses it every day, they wish for a new version, Python 4, that addresses these issues.
