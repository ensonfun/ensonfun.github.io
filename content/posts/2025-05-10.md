### Top 1 Comment Summary

 On an M1 MacBook Pro with 64GB RAM, using the gemma-3-4b-it-GGUF model results in prompt processing of 25 tokens/s and token generation of 63 tokens/s, with an overall processing time of about 15 seconds per image. The 4B model produces decent outputs for image descriptions. To reproduce the setup, clone the repository and build the server with specific parameters. Access the web interface at 127.0.0.1:8080, ensuring to include the --mmproj switch unless using the -hf option. The author anticipates that alternative quantizations may improve speed.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

Users can load images in the chat and interact with the program. It notes that the parameter "-ngl -1" is now unnecessary for Metal backends, as llama.cpp automatically offloads to the GPU, while it remains required for CUDA. The "-1" command indicates that all GPU layers are offloaded.

 The author questions the choice of separating JSON fields like recipients, subject, and sender in a schema instead of combining them into a single headers field. They suggest that while performance might be a reason for this separation, incorporating all headers into a JSON blob allows for flexibility with generated columns that can be indexed. This method enables easy adjustments to the table structure for querying specific fields, like DKIM status, with simple ALTER TABLE commands and indexing, enhancing the schemaâ€™s power and adaptability for user needs.

Despite claiming to be a federated platform without ads or tracking, it fails to specify what those statements apply to. The documentation is overly complex, with multiple versions that don't clearly differentiate their purposes. While it aims to be a toolkit for building social networks, it also presents itself as a social network, leading to ambiguity. The author suggests it should clearly define its function, particularly regarding its support for protocols like ActivityPub or AtProto.

## 9. [Detect and crash Chromium bots](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43916622)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses a bug in headless Chromium browsers that can crash them using a simple JavaScript snippet, potentially serving as a bot detection method. However, it warns that this approach is ineffective for production due to its disruptive nature and detrimental impact on user experience. The detection mechanism is seen as noisy, invasive, and easily circumvented by bot authors, while good bot detection should be subtle, context-aware, and sustainable. Ultimately, while amusing for testing, this method is advised against for actual implementation, especially when affecting legitimate users or crawlers like Googlebot.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The use of `page.evaluate` in Playwright on macOS can cause issues where the browser hangs, preventing proper closure with `browser.close()`, leading to potential memory leaks. Additionally, it creates a duplicate copy of Chrome (over 1GB) that accumulates in the `/private/var/folders/.../X/com.google.Chrome.code_sign_clone/` directory, consuming significant disk space. To avoid this, users must add the flag `--disable-features=MacAppCodeSignClone` to their commands.
