### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a plane landing incident at Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ) on Runway 23. Commenters on r/aviation speculate that the incident was caused by wind shear due to the sudden and drastic change in the aircraft's descent rate, which is too abrupt to be a result of pilot error. They describe the conditions at the time as having heavy snowfall and high wind gusts, creating what was termed a "winter hurricane." The plane involved was a CRJ, and the landing was under crosswind conditions with winds gusting from the northeast at speeds likely over 30 knots. While wind shear is considered the primary cause, some also mention the possibility of wake turbulence, though this is less likely due to the crosswind dispersing any previous aircraft's wake.

## 3. [My washing machine refreshed my thinking on software estimation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43085876)

**Total comment counts : 89**

### Summary

 The article recounts the author's unexpectedly lengthy ordeal with installing a washing machine in a new home, drawing parallels to the complexities of software development estimation. Here's a summary:

- **Initial Expectation**: The author expected the installation to take about 10 minutes, based on previous experiences.

- **Series of Obstacles**: 
  1. **Power Connection**: The builder hadn't drilled a necessary hole for the power cord, requiring the author to purchase and use a hole saw. 
  2. **Drill Compatibility**: His drill was incompatible with the hole saw, necessitating a trip back to the hardware store for a more powerful drill.
  3. **Hose Length**: The existing hoses were too short for the new setup, leading to an unsuccessful attempt to extend them and eventually buying new ones.
  4. **Water Connection**: A steel cap on the water tap was too tight to remove without a larger shifting spanner.
  5. **Drainage Issue**: After connecting everything, the washing machine signaled a drainage error, requiring further investigation.

- **Software Estimation Parallel**: The author uses this experience to illustrate how software projects can have unforeseen complications, making initial time estimates wildly inaccurate due to unexpected "blockers" or issues that arise during the project, much like the hurdles encountered during the washing machine installation. 

The narrative highlights the unpredictability of tasks that seem straightforward but can spiral into complex problem-solving sessions, akin to the challenges faced in software development where initial estimates often fail to account for real-world complications.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the inefficacy of software estimation compared to the more structured approach used in film production. In film, **completion bonds** act as a safeguard, ensuring that a film will be completed or the investors get their money back. Here are the key points:

- **Completion Bonds**: These are essentially insurance policies for film projects, costing around 2% of the production budget. They are common for indie films with budgets ranging from $3 million to $70 million.

- **Penalty for Underestimation**: If a film goes significantly over budget, the bond company can fire the director and take over the project to ensure it gets finished, which adds real accountability.

- **Estimation Process**: Film completion bond companies estimate costs based on historical data from previous films. They have detailed records of expenses for various elements like car chases, and data on the cost-effectiveness of directors, producers, and actors.

- **Contrast with Software**: The article implies that software estimation lacks similar accountability mechanisms, leading to frequent underestimations without significant consequences.

The underlying critique is that software development could benefit from adopting a similar rigorous, data-driven approach to estimation and accountability as seen in film production.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of software development, particularly in understanding client needs. It uses an analogy of installing a washing machine to illustrate that clients often realize what they truly want only after seeing the initial setup or implementation:

1. **Client's Changing Requirements**: Just like the homeowner who wants the washing machine moved after installation, software clients might not realize their exact requirements until they see the software in action.

2. **Unknowability in Software Estimation**: The piece highlights that one of the main issues in software estimation is the client's inability to fully articulate their needs beforehand. This leads to adjustments and changes post-development, which complicates project timelines and expectations.

3. **Billing Strategy**: The author strongly recommends billing by the hour rather than by the project, arguing that this method better accommodates the fluid nature of software development where requirements can change unexpectedly. 

The article concludes that understanding and accommodating these dynamics is crucial for maintaining a good relationship with clients and managing expectations in software projects.

## 5. [670nm red light exposure improved aged mitochondrial function, colour vision](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43066394)

**Total comment counts : 38**

### Summary

 The article discusses a study published in *Scientific Reports* that explores the use of long wavelength light (670 nm) to improve mitochondrial function in aging humans, specifically focusing on the retina. Here are the key points:

- **Mitochondrial Decline and Aging**: Mitochondria, crucial for ATP production, decline in efficiency with age, leading to reduced cellular energy and increased oxidative stress, which accelerates aging.

- **Retinal Aging**: The retina, particularly photoreceptors like rods and cones, has high energy demands and ages rapidly. Rods begin to die off significantly around age 40, while cones, though remaining, lose functionality.

- **Long Wavelength Light Exposure**: Previous animal studies indicated that exposure to light in the 650â€“900 nm range could enhance ATP production, reduce oxidative stress, and slow retinal cell death. Similar benefits were observed in insects and mice.

- **Human Study**: The study tested the effects of a single, brief exposure (3 minutes) to 670 nm light on human subjects aged 37-70 years. This exposure, which was less intense than previous studies, was found to:
  - Improve color contrast sensitivity (CCS) for both tritan (blue-yellow) and protan (red-green) axes when measured three hours post-exposure.
  - Enhance cone-mediated color vision, which is critical in environments with artificial lighting where dark adaptation (rod function) is less common.

- **Results**: There was a significant improvement in color vision, with tritan thresholds improving by 17% and protan by 12%. These improvements varied slightly by age group but were statistically significant across all tested ages.

- **Mechanism**: The likely mechanism involves reducing the viscosity of the water layer around ATP synthase in mitochondria, thereby increasing the efficiency of ATP production.

- **Implications**: This non-invasive, optical intervention could potentially be used to mitigate some aspects of visual decline in aging, enhancing life quality by improving color vision.

The study suggests that even brief exposures to specific wavelengths of light could offer a practical approach to managing some age-related mitochondrial dysfunction in humans.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that there are over 1,000 research papers discussing the effects of red and near-infrared light, particularly focusing on how near-infrared light (NIR) can penetrate several centimeters into the body, thereby influencing mitochondrial function in muscle cells. This is supported by numerous studies accessible via a provided Google Scholar link.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes a study for not including controls that use different light wavelengths, suggesting that the results might simply reflect a daily (diurnal) pattern rather than an effect specific to the light used in the experiment.
