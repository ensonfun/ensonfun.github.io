## 1. [Companies must stop using Google Analytics](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36583906)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The article discusses the audits conducted by the Swedish Data Protection Authority (IMY) on four companies - CDON, Coop, Dagens Industri, and Tele2 - regarding their transfer of personal data to the US through Google Analytics. The audits were initiated based on complaints from the organization None of Your Business (NOYB) in light of the Schrems II ruling by the European Court of Justice (CJEU), which stated that the US did not provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. IMY finds that the data transferred via Google Analytics is personal data and that the technical security measures taken by the companies are insufficient. Tele2 is fined 12 million SEK and CDON is fined 300,000 SEK, while the other three companies are ordered to stop using the tool. These decisions are expected to have implications for other organizations using Google Analytics.

**Total comment counts : 45**

### Summary

 The author, who used to spend a lot of time consuming digital content for learning purposes, realized that they were not retaining most of the information. They discovered that learning requires effortful engagement, and passive consumption of digital content does not lead to long-term retention.

**Total comment counts : 51**

### Summary

 The article discusses the implementation and effects of the "Clean City Law" in São Paulo, Brazil in 2006. The law banned outdoor advertisements, including billboards, transit ads, and storefront signs. Within a year, 15,000 billboards were taken down and store signs had to be reduced in size. The law also made pamphleteering in public spaces illegal. The article acknowledges initial concerns about the law leading to lost revenue and jobs, as well as a bland cityscape. However, the city's economy did not suffer, and a survey showed that 70% of residents found the ban beneficial. The removal of advertisements revealed previously hidden urban beauty and exposed overlooked architecture. Similar bans on billboards exist in other parts of the world, including some places in the US and Europe.

## 7. [SQLite-based databases on the Postgres protocol? Yes we can](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36582255)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of using SQLite as a production backend due to its lack of network accessibility. However, a fork of SQLite called libSQL has been created to address these limitations. The latest addition to libSQL is "server mode" (known as sqld) which allows network access and replication to multiple instances. The article provides examples of how the server mode works and mentions the support of HTTP commands and a native TypeScript client. The fork of SQLite was necessary because SQLite does not allow virtualization of the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) methods. By virtualizing the WAL, libSQL can capture updates to the database in real-time. The article also mentions the goal of libSQL to go beyond server mode and invites contributions to the project.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of using both SQLite and Postgres for a backend app. The author highlights the differences between the two databases, such as the need for different codepaths and variations in functionality. For example, only Postgres supports certain commands like `with conn.cursor as cur`, and SQLite requires additional steps for escaping things for columns and table names.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience working on Marmot and the importance of allowing readers to perform tasks within the same process rather than relying on a protocol such as HTTP or Postgres. They also mention a similar issue with rqlite and dqlite and made a deliberate decision to design Marmot as a side-car rather than a layer on top, as they believe this aligns better with the principles of SQLite.
