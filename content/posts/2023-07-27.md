## 3. [Wavy walls use fewer bricks than a straight wall (2020)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36892970)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 Wavy walls, also known as crinkle crankle walls, crinkum crankum walls, serpentine walls, or ribbon walls, are popular in England and are made using fewer bricks than straight walls. These walls have alternate convex and concave curves that provide stability and resistance to lateral forces. Suffolk County in England is home to many examples of these walls, with 100 documented and photographed on freston.net. The University of Virginia in the United States also has a well-known serpentine wall, which Thomas Jefferson incorporated into the architecture. These wavy walls have a mathematical basis that makes them more resistant to horizontal forces such as wind compared to straight walls.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of worm fences in rural areas of the US since the 1600s. Worm fences are made without posts, allowing for easy installation on large areas of land without the need for digging holes. The author initially finds the practice unnecessary until realizing its time-saving benefits.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of considering failure modes in different types of walls when a tree falls into them. It explains that in a straight wall, the failure can spread along the entire length, while in a wavy wall, the failure is more likely to be limited to one section.

## 4. [Google Web Environment Integrity Is the New Microsoft Trusted Computing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36888156)

**Total comment counts : 43**

### Summary

 The author discusses Google's proposal for Web Environment Integrity and expresses concern about its potential implications. They draw parallels between Google's proposal and Microsoft's ill-fated "Palladium" initiative in the past. The author also criticizes Google's Play Integrity API and argues that it is easily bypassed by rooted devices. They express concerns about the possibility of Web Environment Integrity being used by companies like Chase Bank to impose limitations on certain operating systems or to require specific security measures. The author suggests that if Web Environment Integrity becomes a reality, government regulation may be necessary to ensure fair treatment and unbundling requirements for all browsers. They urge organizations like EFF and FSF to join the fight against Google's anti-user practices.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses three problems related to trusted computing and its impact on computer users. The first problem is the restriction on users rolling their own keys, which means they cannot create their own encryption keys. The article states that this limitation makes it impossible for users to simulate the workings of a trusted platform module (TPM) through software without using Microsoft's or Apple's keys. The second problem relates to the inability to use older or niche hardware that is not compatible with trusted computing. This renders many older devices useless and raises concerns about the functionality of TPM-less devices like Chromebooks. The final problem mentioned is the potential shift towards DRM (Digital Rights Management) as the future of the web. The author contemplates whether the trusted computing concept will require users to prove the authenticity of their devices using certified TPM keys, electronic national ID cards, or both. The article suggests that the era of unrestricted web browsing may be viewed as a naive and unnecessary phase, similar to the need for central authorities to regulate SSL certificates and domain names.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Microsoft's Pluton processor, a security chip designed for the future of Windows PCs. The author mentions that although they had previously won a fight against Palladium, Microsoft is now implementing their ideas in Xbox, Azure Sphere, and future Windows hardware requirements. The Pluton CPU may be present in upcoming PCs, including those used by UNIX-focused individuals.

## 5. [Tesla created secret team to suppress thousands of driving range complaints](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36891642)

**Total comment counts : 66**

### Summary

 Tesla created a "Diversion Team" in Las Vegas to cancel service appointments from customers complaining about poor driving range in their electric vehicles, according to sources. The team's goal was to save Tesla money by avoiding costly repairs and ease the pressure on service centers. Tesla has been accused of exaggerating range estimates for its vehicles by rigging their range-estimating software. The company created algorithms for its range meter to show drivers optimistic projections of driving distance on a full battery, but the estimates would become more realistic as the battery depleted. According to experts, Tesla vehicles often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates. The company's range estimates did not change to reflect external temperatures, according to data collected by EV analytics company Recurrent. Other automakers' in-dash range meters were found to be more accurate. Last year, South Korean regulators fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website. Tesla established the diversion team as demand for service appointments grew, resulting in long wait times. Advisers on the team were instructed to divert customers who did not need in-person service and to downplay range complaints by explaining that range estimates were just predictions and that batteries degrade over time. Tesla recently stopped using its Nevada diversion team to handle range-related complaints and switched to virtual service advisors in Utah.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is someone expressing their dislike for their Tesla Model Y car, specifically criticizing the accuracy of the battery meter display. They believe that the displayed battery range in miles is inflated by at least 25%. However, they acknowledge that when they input a destination, the displayed numbers for the battery range become more accurate and reliable, taking into account factors such as wind, elevation, and temperature. Overall, they remain skeptical of Tesla's claims but find the destination-based battery range to be accurate.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article believes that the confusion surrounding Tesla's range stems from the displayed EPA range on the car's heads-up display (HUD). They argue that the battery percentage is a more useful display option. The author also points out that gas vehicles rarely meet their EPA range, and the same should be expected for Tesla. They explain that wind resistance significantly affects range, especially at higher speeds. The author emphasizes that Tesla's trip computer is accurate, with only a 7% discrepancy observed in extreme conditions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author encountered emulation issues while running their dedicated game server build for Linux in an Amazon Linux docker container on their M2 Mac using Docker for Apple Silicon. Despite specifying the correct platform and upgrading the emulation software, a syscall from the mono side was not properly emulated. The author found it ironic considering how containers are often marketed as lighter weight VMs that eliminate the "works on my machine" problem. They decided to spin up an AWS EC2 instance for testing purposes and mentioned the possibility of using podman or creating a local VM using a vagrant file. The author expressed frustration with the image technology becoming a hassle, but they expect their workload to be fully supported eventually.

## 8. [Depthboot – Your Chromebook, your way](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36888598)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 This article is announcing that a project has been archived. The project offered a variety of common Linux distributions and desktop environments to create a bootable image for supported 64-bit Chromebooks. It thanks all contributors and users of the project.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their appreciation for the concept of the Chromebook, which offers a disposable device with a disposable operating system. They highlight its secure by default nature and the ability to easily restore to the factory image. The author proposes that these principles should be applied in a privacy-respecting manner, allowing users to bring their own devices and choose their identity provider and storage backend. They suggest that an immutable and secure-by-default operating system would be interesting but note that existing options like NixOS/Guix and Alpine & OpenBSD have their own complexities. The author also mentions the need for a user-friendly experience on top of the secure base.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience using a Chromebook as their primary device. They mention that the dev environment can be a bit quirky since it runs in a container instead of directly on the virtual machine. However, the author has created a script to set up an EC2 instance and manage it, which solves any issues. They highlight several advantages of using a Chromebook, including its compatibility with multiple monitors, its ability to isolate risky activities like code development from sensitive tasks like web browsing, the use of Debian as the operating system, and its multiuser functionality. The main limitation mentioned is the virtual machine, but it is considered niche since not many people need to run Firecracker. Overall, the author finds the Chromebook to be everything they want in a laptop without unnecessary features.

## 9. [Paris to bring back swimming in Seine after 100 years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36859614)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 Paris is nearing the completion of a €1.4bn regeneration project aimed at improving the water quality in the River Seine, which was previously too polluted for swimming. As a legacy of the Olympics, scheduled to take place in Paris in 2024, three Olympic and Paralympic events will be held in the Seine, and by 2025, three open-air swimming areas will be accessible from the quayside. The project includes building a vast underground reservoir to store run-off in times of heavy rain, preventing it from flowing directly into the river. Over the past 20 years, the water quality in the Seine has already significantly improved, and efforts to eradicate the last remaining contaminants are underway. The regeneration project aims to make the river safe for swimming, attract tourists, and benefit the city's residents.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses support for the idea of people being able to swim in the city. They enjoy spending time near the Seine and like the idea of being able to dip their legs in the water. However, they are concerned about the amount of trash and debris in the river, such as potato chips, cigarette cartons, and beer cans. They also mention the occasional bicycle being thrown in. They question how the management of this issue will be handled and how separated the proposed swimming spots will be. The author mentions swimming in the Ohio River as a child and suggests that despite the concerns, they are still alive.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes the author's living situation on a boat on the Seine River in Meudon near Paris. They enjoy swimming and paddling on hot days and mention that their neighbors fish outside their windows. However, they caution against going in the water after heavy rains. The overall environment is described as wonderful with trees and fresh air.

## 10. [Data diffs: Algorithms for explaining what changed in a dataset (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36888667)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of explanation algorithms in the data world. These algorithms are used to answer "why" questions about data, such as why there was a decrease in purchases or an increase in medical costs. The article mentions two approaches to explanation algorithms: Scorpion, which operates on aggregates and highlights outliers, and DIFF, a database operator that can be expressed in SQL. The author also introduces an open-source implementation of DIFF in their datools library. The article provides examples and explanations of how these algorithms work, and discusses the limitations and future improvements of DIFF.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that the "diff" described is a data science data comparison tool, not a data engineering tool that compares two tables. The author suggests a SQL technique using GROUP BY/UNION ALL/HAVING operators to validate if two large tables are the same and if the data has not been corrupted or duplicated. This technique can be useful for regression testing algorithmic results or testing data migrations. The author claims to have compared a pair of billion-row tables in under a minute using this technique.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential of Dolt, a platform that specializes in modeling and optimization. The author highlights a use case scenario in which Dolt could be useful, specifically in managing and summarizing data that changes over time. They mention a previous lack of tools to effectively track and understand changes in optimization models, but believe that Dolt has the potential to fill this gap.
