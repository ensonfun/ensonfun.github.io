## 1. [Parametric CAD in Rust](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46786196)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 vcad is a Rust-based CAD tool that treats parts as named geometry, using primitives, boolean operations (-, +, &), and transforms to create parametric, regenerable designs—no GUI clicking. It exports STL for printing and glTF/GLB scenes with TOML-defined PBR materials for visualization. The engine is a C++ core with Rust bindings, a manifold geometry engine delivering watertight meshes. The workflow emphasizes tests and linting (cargo test, cargo clippy) and strong typing to prevent mistakes. It’s built for AI agents, with extensive docs, API tables, a Blender MCP workflow, MIT-licensed, v0.1. Go make something.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion critiques a Rust-based CAD approach by arguing it misunderstands pro-level parametric CAD workflows and should be compared to existing programmatic CAD tools like OpenSCAD and Fornjot rather than traditional desktop CAD.
- Concern: The main worry is that the new tool may misrepresent professional CAD needs and rely on a geometry kernel that is unsuitable for serious CAD usage.
- Perspectives: Views range from enthusiastic proponents of programmatic CAD (OpenSCAD-like, Rust-based) to critics who favor traditional constraint-based parametric modeling and established software like SolidWorks or Onshape.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed (cautiously optimistic with significant skepticism).

## 5. [Try text scaling support in Chrome Canary](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46784977)

**Total comment counts : 2**

### Summary

 An experimental HTML meta tag, <meta name=text-scale>, lets browsers respect user OS text-size preferences, addressing web accessibility gaps where system text size doesn’t affect websites. Proposed in CSS Fonts 5, now in Chrome Canary behind a flag and supported in the spec. Sites opting in can scale text up to ~200% without horizontal scrolling, improving WCAG 2.2 compliance (Resize Text, Reflow). Tips: prefer font-relative units (em/rem) for text; avoid using px for text sizing; if you override the default font size, text-scale has no effect. Use percentages to adjust default size. Borders/scaling considerations vary.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Grateful for an accessibility improvement and questioning why text scaling is implemented via a meta tag instead of CSS.
- Concern: Using a meta tag rather than CSS may be suboptimal or less robust/maintainable for text scaling.
- Perspectives: One viewpoint expresses gratitude for the improvement, while another questions the technical implementation choice.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

- Perspectives: Views range from cautious optimism about accessibility and tool evolution to strong skepticism about quality, integrity, and societal impacts, with mentions of potential mitigations like open-source or self-hosted alternatives.
- Overall sentiment: Cautiously pessimistic

## 7. [SoundCloud Data Breach Now on HaveIBeenPwned](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46782930)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 SoundCloud disclosed in December 2025 that unauthorised activity allowed an attacker to map public profile data to email addresses for about 20% of users, affecting 29.8 million accounts. Exposed data included 30 million unique emails, names, usernames, avatars, follower/following counts, and, in some cases, country. The attackers extorted SoundCloud and released the data in January 2026. The breach was added to Have I Been Pwned on 27 January 2026. Immediate advice: change the affected passwords across all accounts and enable 2FA where available.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread discusses a large SoundCloud data breach and its implications, including what data was exposed and how deletion, public versus scraped data, and potential misuse are being interpreted.
- Concern: The primary worry is that exposed data could be used for scams, phishing, identity/privacy invasion, and even crypto theft, especially given the potential exposure of emails, web history, and other metadata.
- Perspectives: Opinions vary from claiming that only public data was leaked and risks are minimal to criticizing SoundCloud’s data handling and highlighting the broader privacy and security harms from the breach.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [Time Station Emulator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46786183)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 Time Station Emulator turns nearly any phone or tablet into a low-frequency time-signal transmitter to sync radio-controlled clocks and watches. Real-time broadcasts have limited range and can be noisy, so this helps where no signal is available. It requires a WebAssembly-capable browser with DAC support for ≥44.1 kHz PCM. Devices from 2019 onward work best; as of early-2024, Safari iOS and Firefox Android have issues. Use a built-in speaker and place it close to the clock’s antenna. Start transmission; clocks should sync within about three minutes. It generates an audio waveform to mimic RF time signals. Hosted at timestation.pages.dev.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A commenter argues that real-world DACs generate high-frequency harmonics that could leak as a short-range radio signal through the wiring and mocks others who propose this idea.
- Concern: The post warns against giving credibility to implausible electronic claims and risks spreading misinformation through ridicule.
- Perspectives: The comment reflects a skeptical, mocking stance toward the claim, framed as a sarcastic critique and self-deprecating humor.
- Overall sentiment: Highly critical
