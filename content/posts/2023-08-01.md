### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the challenges of replicating scientific experiments, particularly in the field of materials science. The author emphasizes that it is common for early replication attempts to fail, especially when there is insufficient documentation of methodology. The original team responsible for the research encountered difficulties in producing consistent results, with correct production achieved in less than 10% of runs. Additionally, it is revealed that the research paper was prematurely released on arXiv by a former member of the team, causing some of the researchers to hurriedly publish what they had to avoid losing credit. The author acknowledges that it may take months or longer to verify the legitimacy of the material under study, and a failed replication after just two days is not conclusive evidence against its properties. Ultimately, time will be necessary to determine if the material is a superconductor, with potential viral videos presenting convincing evidence of its properties.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a claim that a new type of material could conduct electricity perfectly at room temperature. The material is an altered version of lead-apatite, made by combining lanarkite and copper phosphide. To verify the claim, researchers tested the conductivity and magnetic reaction of these materials. They found that lanarkite and copper phosphide did not conduct electricity well, while the altered lead-apatite behaved more like a semiconductor. Additionally, the lead-apatite did not repel magnets, which is a key property of superconductors. Based on these findings, the researchers suggest that the original claim should be re-examined as the material did not behave like a superconductor in their tests.

## 2. [Jujutsu: A Git-compatible DVCS that is both simple and powerful](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36952796)

**Total comment counts : 45**

### Summary

 The article discusses a project called Jujutsu, which is an experimental version-control system (VCS). It combines features from Git, Mercurial, Pijul/Darcs, and also has unique features. Jujutsu has two backends, one of which is a Git backend, allowing users to switch between Jujutsu and Git.

It also explains that Jujutsu operates primarily on commits in the repository, leaving the functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to centralized code. The article further describes how Jujutsu records all operations performed in the repository, allowing for easy reversion to previous states or undoing specific operations. Additionally, it mentions conflict resolution, rebasing, and other features available in Jujutsu. The article acknowledges that Jujutsu is still evolving and mentions some limitations and performance issues. It provides instructions for building and installing Jujutsu on different operating systems. The article concludes by suggesting that users go through the tutorial to get started with Jujutsu and also provides links to related work and a comparison between Jujutsu and Git commands.

## 10. [Nvidia H100 GPUs: Supply and Demand](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36951872)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article discusses the supply and demand issues surrounding GPUs, particularly Nvidia H100s, and how it is affecting the AI industry. It highlights quotes from CEOs and executives about the shortage and its impact on product rollouts and model training. The demand for H100 GPUs is high among startups, cloud providers, and AI companies, resulting in limited availability and increased prices. The article also delves into the reasons behind the bottleneck, including the difficulty of manufacturing HBM memory, the limited supply of metal elements, and the capacity constraints of TSMC, the main manufacturer of these GPUs. The article concludes by mentioning that Nvidia is working on increasing its supply in the second half of the year but warns that scarcity may be causing a self-reinforcing cycle of GPU hoarding. Overall, the shortage of H100 GPUs is having a significant impact on the AI industry's ability to scale and innovate.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the challenge faced by engineers who are lagging behind in the race of technological advancements. In the past, engineers could experiment with web 1.0 and web 2.0 platforms by renting cheap Virtual Private Servers (VPS) for $10/month. However, now the scenario is different, as access to powerful hardware such as 1000+ H100s is extremely expensive, costing millions of dollars in capital. Even renting such hardware at that scale would amount to $4,000 per hour, which quickly becomes costly. The author hopes that there will be a way to fine-tune medium-sized models without exorbitant prices. Currently, even small corporations like tinybox cost $15,000 and it is unclear how much work can be accomplished using it. The article suggests that the reason many startups rely on wrappers around OpenAI and similar platforms is due to these challenges.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article highlights a concerning issue that is not being widely discussed - there is currently a shortage of available power in the United States. The article mentions that major technology companies, known as FAANGS (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google), have already secured contracts for power and physical space. Additionally, even if one were able to acquire a large number of GPUs (graphics processing units), deploying them for computation would be difficult as the required power and cooling infrastructure isn't readily available. The article emphasizes that small-scale solutions, such as using chicken farms as data centers, are insufficient. Furthermore, the increasing demand for large-scale training necessitates at least 10MW of power, which cannot be distributed across multiple data centers due to the data having to be located in one place. The article ends on a somewhat pessimistic note, wishing the reader good luck with these challenges.
