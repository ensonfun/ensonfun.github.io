## 1. [On clock faces, 4 is Expressed as IIII, not IV](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39700655)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 This article discusses the use of Roman numerals on clocks and the unconventional notation of "4" as "IIII" instead of "IV". It explains that this convention dates back to the late 14th century when King Charles V of France believed that "IV" brought bad luck because it subtracted 1 from his title, 5. The notation "IIII" was used in the Wells Cathedral clock in England and became conventional in the industry due to its visual balance on radial dial plates. The article also mentions the unexpected history of clock numbers using Roman numerals.

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses the efforts to simplify Emacs Lisp (Elisp) by removing the use of Common Lisp features and introducing a new pattern-matching conditional called cond*. Richard Stallman, the creator of Emacs, finds the existing macro, pcase, overly complex and cryptic. He aims to create a more concise and simpler alternative that combines the cond form and let for handling multiple values and variable bindings. Stallman's proposal led to a lengthy discussion and debate among developers. The article also mentions ongoing efforts to improve the documentation for pcase and resolve confusion related to its use of punctuation marks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is about the documentation of pcase, a macro in Emacs Lisp. It provides a link to the official GNU documentation for pcase and another link to a version of pcase with cond*.

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 The article discusses a 12-byte x86 program that writes itself to standard output when executed in a DOS environment. The program is compatible with MS-DOS 6.22, Windows 98, and DOSBox, and can be executed by writing the bytes to a file with a .COM extension. The article also provides instructions on how to demonstrate and verify the program's output. The program is disassembled to reveal its functionality, which involves reading the program's bytes and writing them to standard output. The program is then compared to the definition of a quine, which is a program that produces an identical copy of its own source code as its output. Although the x86 program produces identical output, it is not considered a proper quine because it does not meet the requirement of taking no input.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author created something similar to what is being discussed in the article and searched extensively for information on it being a quine. They express gratitude for the information shared.

## 9. [Cloudflare loses 22% of its domains in Freenom .tk shutdown](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39725303)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 A large number of domains on TLDs controlled by Freenom (.tk, .cf, and .gq) have been shut down, resulting in a significant decrease in websites hosted by Cloudflare. This represents a 98.7% drop from the previous month. These domains were country code top-level domains for Tokelau, Central African Republic, and Equatorial Guinea, but were rarely used by entities from those countries. The drop in domains is likely due to a series of events that started with Freenom being sued for ignoring abuse complaints. Freenom subsequently paused new domain registrations, and the amount of cybercrime decreased on two TLDs that moved away from Freenom. Freenom announced its exit from the domain name business on February 12, 2024. This loss has affected Cloudflare, as the .tk, .cf, and .gq domains previously accounted for 23.1% of all domains hosted on its platform. The number of SSL certificates issued to .tk domains indicates when the shutdown occurred. The shutdown has led to a decrease in the number of malicious URLs blocked on these TLDs.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reminisces about their experiences with using the .tk domain as a child, as it was the only way for them to create websites without a bank account or international credit card. They created numerous websites using .tk for classmates, school, and family.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that although there may be complaints about Cloudflare hosting criminals, there would also be complaints if Cloudflare had the power to take down websites it doesn't like. The author believes that the current outcome is the best because it shows that the system is working, even if it is slow. The author suggests that it is preferable for Cloudflare not to act as the internet police more than necessary.

## 10. [Libraries struggle to afford e-books, seek new laws in fight with publishers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39724045)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 Libraries in the United States are struggling to afford the rising costs of e-books and audiobooks. These digital titles often come with a significantly higher price tag than what consumers pay. For example, while a library may purchase a hardcover copy of a book for $18, it costs $55 to lease a digital copy. Additionally, e-books expire after a limited time or a certain number of checkouts. Libraries have been advocating for legislation to address the affordability and restriction issues surrounding electronic materials, but they face opposition from the publishing industry. The pandemic has increased the popularity of e-books, leading to long waiting lists and limited digital offerings. Lawmakers in several states have proposed bills to close the affordability gap, but the publishing industry argues that such legislation undermines intellectual property rights. Libraries are struggling to maintain their collections due to the high costs of replacing expired e-books. Dumping e-books and audiobooks is not considered an option for libraries as many patrons rely on these resources. Maryland and New York have previously attempted to regulate publishing transactions with libraries but faced legal obstacles. Some current legislative proposals aim to allow libraries to negotiate deals with publishers on specific terms, rather than mandating publishers to take certain actions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that changing copyright laws to allow book owners to freely convert physical books into digital formats and vice versa could be a solution. Additionally, the article suggests restricting the ability to lease books, so people have complete ownership after purchase. The idea is to allow book owners to donate their books to libraries, which could then scan or purchase scanned copies for restricted checkouts. The Internet Archive is mentioned as doing something similar, but it is unclear if libraries could donate their books to the Internet Archive for electronic versions.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The publishing industry argues that if someone cannot afford to buy or rent a book, they can use a public or university library to access it. However, this argument has become more of a cliché than a valid point. With the rise of e-books, the industry has limited library capabilities, requiring payment for lending and restricting the number of simultaneous lends. Many universities have cancelled access contracts for papers due to high costs, and smaller universities cannot afford these subscriptions. The article suggests that the publishing industry needs more regulation as the free market is not effective in this area.
