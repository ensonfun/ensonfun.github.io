## 3. [Marketing to Engineers (2001)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41368583)

**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

 The article discusses key insights on how to effectively advertise and sell products to engineers. The main points are as follows:

1. Engineers have a low opinion of advertising and advertising people. To appeal to them, marketing materials should be informational, professional, and avoid sounding like typical advertising.

2. Engineers do not respond well to a consumer approach. They prefer straightforward, low-key, and professional communication that addresses them as knowledgeable professionals in search of engineering solutions.

3. The engineer's buying decision is more logical than emotional. They carefully weigh facts, make comparisons, and make purchases based on what product best meets their requirements.

4. Engineers want to know the features and specifications of a product, not just the benefits. Performance characteristics, technical specifications, and other technical details are important to them.

5. Engineers appreciate jargon. Using technical language and jargon shows that you speak their language and can enhance communication with them.

Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of clarity, professionalism, and technical information when advertising and selling products to engineers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Engineers are not deterred by jargon and, in fact, they appreciate it. Jargon in the engineering field serves the purpose of conveying precise meaning that common words cannot. For example, using specific terms such as "API" and "container images" provides more valuable information than using generic terms like "product" or "software." Engineers consider specific details crucial when evaluating products.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues against the notion that engineers do not make purchases based on emotions. It states that engineers have their own set of emotions that influence their buying decisions, such as the desire for intellectual respect, risk aversion, professional pride, peer validation, and cognitive bias. These emotions may not align with those of typical consumers, but they are still influential in engineers' decision-making process. The article suggests that effective marketing to engineers should acknowledge these emotional drivers while also providing the technical information necessary to justify their decisions.

## 4. [I'm blocking connections from AWS to my on-prem services](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41396641)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article discusses the fragmented state of the internet due to the dominance of large cloud providers and bulletproof infrastructure. It mentions the history of internet access, from its early days as a private network for government, military, and research institutions to its expansion as public access was allowed. However, the access had to be strictly non-commercial, meaning no commercial traffic could transit the backbone of the internet. Despite this, the article explains how the internet eventually became commercialized, with ISPs providing services like email and web servers. The monetization of the internet led to a dieoff in the early 2000s, with surviving models focusing on advertising and selling user behavioral data. The article also touches on the current use of AI in training models through the collection and analysis of vast amounts of accessible content.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how major cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, and Google, all publish machine-readable lists of their IP address ranges. These lists can be used by users to identify and monitor the IP addresses associated with these cloud providers. The article includes links to the IP address ranges published by each of these providers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience with the rapid attacks on their internet infrastructure. They recently announced a subnet for an anycast setup, and immediately noticed a surge in port scan activity on all IP addresses within that range. The author believes that this indiscriminate scanning for open ports is a common practice. They express shock at the number of people who openly expose internal web services to the internet, recommending the use of an additional layer of protection such as a VPN. The author themselves only exposes SSH through a single bastion host and plans to add a VPN layer in the future.

The API follows a modern-style rendering approach and includes binding, render, and compute dispatch calls. The author asks for support and clarifies certain aspects of the proposal. They also mention the possibility of combining their branch with another in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article states that SDL3, a software development library, is still in preview but the new GPU API has been merged into the main branch. This GPU API is significant because it allows developers to write graphics code and shaders once and have it work across different platforms, including consoles. Previously, achieving this level of cross-platform compatibility required Unity, Unreal, or a custom solution. There is another cross-platform graphics stack called WebGPU/WGSL, but it does not have console backends. It is also mentioned that the SDL3 GPU API currently does not seem to support WebGPU as a backend.
