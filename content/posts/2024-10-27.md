## 3. [We shrunk our Javascript monorepo git size](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41959428)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges faced by a large JavaScript monorepo at Microsoft, known as 1JS, which has grown to over 20 million lines of code and 178GB in size. Initially, the repo only measured a few gigabytes, but it expanded due to several factors, including the accumulation of large binary files and inefficient management of change files caused by the usage of the Beachball tool.

To mitigate git bloat, the team implemented two significant changes: modifying the Beachball tool to handle multiple changes in a single file and creating a pipeline to periodically clean up excessive change files. Despite these efforts, the growth rate of the repository remained concerning. After recognizing that their growth had surpassed even Microsoft Office's monorepo, they sought expert help.

An engineer with experience in optimizing git for large repos discovered a fundamental issue with how git was compressing files. It was mistakenly comparing and repacking CHANGELOG.md files across different packages, leading to unnecessary data bloat. The team then applied a solution, using a more advanced git repack command to address the problem and reduce the repo size.

## 7. [Debugging my wife's alarm clock](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41958620)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article details a man's experience with his wife's malfunctioning alarm clock, which began resetting itself instead of ringing at the designated time. After replacing the battery, he discovered that the clock doesn't consistently use it for power, as it relies on AC for timekeeping. Upon opening the clock, he noted that it contained a simple integrated circuit and other basic components, with no apparent damage inside. He speculated that when the alarm activates, it pulls voltage from the battery, but a nearly dead battery causes a drop in power, resulting in a reset. He also found that the alarm sound was clearer when running on battery alone. Although he doesn’t favor the design of the clock, he intends to investigate further, particularly the possibility of a faulty capacitor, as suggested by readers. He emphasized the importance of reproducing issues when diagnosing problems.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an issue with an alarm system where removing the battery causes the clock to reset continuously. It suggests that a partially drained battery allows the clock to function briefly before resetting. The analysis indicates that the transformer and power supply provide multiple voltages; while the +9V rail is faulty, the +5V rail for the LED display is operational. Consequently, the alarm chip and sounder rely solely on the weak 9V battery, leading to resets when the alarm tries to sound due to excessive power demand.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Older wall clocks employed synchronous motors that relied on the AC power waveform to move the second hand. As generator loads increased, RPMs decreased, resulting in power running slightly slower than the standard 60Hz. To keep clocks accurate, power stations sometimes had to operate "fast" at night, ensuring a total of 86,400 cycles in a 24-hour period. The author mentions that when power companies fail to maintain an average of 60Hz, it can lead to issues with clock accuracy, referencing discussions on this topic.

## 8. [Canvas Fingerprinting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41958255)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Canvas API, which is typically used for drawing graphics with JavaScript and HTML, and its application in online tracking through browser fingerprinting. This method takes advantage of differences in how canvas images are rendered across various web browsers and platforms, creating a unique digital fingerprint for a user's browser. Factors such as the browser, operating system, and graphics card can alter the rendering, leading to distinct images even when the same JavaScript code is used. Text rendering also varies based on font settings and anti-aliasing methods.

To obtain a fingerprint, developers can use the `toDataURL()` function to extract and encode the image data, then compute an MD5 hash, or use a CRC checksum from the PNG file’s IDAT chunk. The article references a significant study that popularized this tracking technique, which is now utilized by many websites. Additionally, it mentions a Firefox add-on designed to modify the JavaScript API for the canvas to prevent this type of fingerprinting.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The PaleMoon browser includes a configuration setting called `canvas.poisondata`, accessible in the Preferences GUI, which helps prevent browser fingerprinting. However, it's important to recognize that this feature alone isn't sufficient, as browser fingerprinting typically involves gathering various other data points. When combined, these data can create a unique profile that may identify or categorize your browser. Overall, the article conveys a sense of futility in the ongoing struggle for online privacy.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a user's experience with a website that claims to track uniqueness for web browsing. Initially, the user sees a 99.9% uniqueness score in one window, followed by a 100% score with a different signature in another window. This inconsistency leads the user to question the effectiveness of the tracking technique, speculating that if tracking were accurate, the signature would remain the same. The user is unsure whether their understanding of web tracking and signatures is correct.

## 9. [How JPEG XL compares to other image codecs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41920055)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses JPEG XL, a new image codec currently being standardized by the JPEG Committee. It combines features from Google’s PIK codec and Cloudinary’s Free Universal Image Format (FUIF) codec, aiming to improve upon existing image formats like HEIC and AVIF. JPEG XL is notable for its ability to transcode existing JPEG files reversibly without quality loss, which is a significant advantage over previous formats that resulted in generation loss.

The codec is also free and open-source, licensed under Apache 2.0, offering a royalty-free patent grant, unlike HEIC and, to a lesser extent, AVIF. JPEG XL supports progressive decoding and legacy compatibility, making it easier to transition from JPEG without needing to store multiple versions of images. Its compression excels at higher perceptual qualities while maintaining fine image details, as opposed to video-based formats that may sacrifice quality for low bitrate efficiency. The reference encoder for JPEG XL produces images indistinguishable from the originals, promoting its use for high-quality image delivery.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the ongoing curiosity about JPEG XL and why it hasn't become the standard for image formats. It mentions that while JPEG XL is compared to video formats like AV1 and HEVC for tasks such as animation and cinemagraphs, those formats are deemed more suitable. The author poses a question about the absence of a video format that inherently supports seamless looping, unlike GIFs, which loop automatically. They note that in video playback, users often rely on player settings to loop videos, which can lead to interruptions in playback. The article queries why a video format with built-in looping capabilities doesn't exist, suggesting it might be assumed that users will manage looping through player configurations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 JPEG XL consists of three codecs: 

1. **Lossless Ultra-Packer**: This codec offers fully reversible compression for existing JPEG files, restoring them to byte-for-byte identical formats.
  
2. **VarDCT Mode**: Functions similarly to JPEG and lossy WebP, as well as video codecs, allowing for various levels of lossy compression.

3. **Modular Mode**: A distinct codec that produces different types of compression artifacts, characterized by pixelation and slight color variations without the ringing artifacts typical of JPEGs. While primarily utilized for lossless compression, it also supports lossy compression.
