 I apologize, but I cannot access or summarize specific articles as I am a text-based AI assistant.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses specific claims against Apple regarding its alleged monopolistic practices. These claims are as follows: 

1. Restrictions on "Super Apps": Apple limits the availability of "Super Apps" on its App Store, which are apps that offer a variety of services within a single app. It is argued that Apple makes it difficult or impossible for developers to offer this type of app on their platform, while Apple itself has its own "super app" ecosystem. 

2. Restrictions on Cloud Streaming Apps: Similar to "super apps," Apple is accused of restricting apps that stream different apps directly to the phone, such as video games. These alleged roadblocks make it challenging for such apps to be released and promoted, potentially posing a threat to Apple's own gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade. 

3. Lack of Messaging Interoperability: The document states that there is a lack of feature parity between messaging platforms on iOS and Android devices. 

4. Restrictions on Smartwatches: It is claimed that Apple limits the functionality of other smartwatches, making them less useful than the Apple Watch. Additionally, the Apple Watch is not compatible with Android devices. 

5. Restrictions on Digital Wallets: The article alleges that Apple restricts access to APIs, allowing only Apple Pay to implement "tap to pay" functionality on iOS. This not only creates lock-in for Apple but also enables them to collect fees from banks using Apple Pay, providing direct financial benefit and enhancing the Apple platform.

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Researchers at Northeastern University conducted a study to understand how parrots use touchscreen devices. The study involved 20 pet parrots playing a tablet game that collected data on their interactions with the touchscreens. The researchers aimed to establish a framework for designing tech specifically for parrot use. The findings revealed that parrots primarily used their tongues to operate the tablets, making them less accurate than humans. The study also showed that parrots can control their tongues very quickly, leading to an ergonomic adjustment in the app's interface. The research further supports the idea that touchscreens can enhance parrots' lives. The researchers emphasize that the systems they are developing are intended for humans and animals to use collaboratively and enhance their interactions.

## 9. [Why did we wait so long for the bicycle? (2019)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39774253)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 The article discusses why the bicycle wasn't invented until the late 1800s, despite it being a relatively simple mechanical invention. Several hypotheses are explored, including technology factors, design iteration, quality of roads, competition from horses, general economic growth, and cultural factors. The article concludes that while these factors may have played a role, technology factors seem to be the most convincing explanation. However, early experimentation and prototypes could have been built without the advanced manufacturing techniques required for precision and cost.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article recommends the book "Two Wheels Good: The History and Mystery of the Bicycle" for its exploration of the bicycle's origin, social implications in different cultures, including its association with women's liberation, and the modern e-bike movement. It praises the book as well-written and rates it highly.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article highlights that in the mid-1800s, cities were generally small, with most being only 1-1.5 km long, consisting of 2-3 streets. The exception to this was capital cities like London, which were bigger but still relatively small in distance compared to today. The main mode of transportation during this time was walking, as destinations within an average city could be reached in 15 minutes on foot. Therefore, bicycles did not offer significant time savings. It was not until the second half of the 19th century that cities started growing larger, which led to transportation becoming a problem.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of HTMX, which is described as an appliance rather than a framework. This means that while HTMX can be effective for basic HTML sites by using HTML attributes, it may not be suitable for more complex functionalities that require custom JavaScript. Integrating HTMX with custom JavaScript can be problematic, as it lacks a clear integration path and can interfere with the lifecycle of other elements. Additionally, it is suggested that tools like jQuery or React/Svelte may be needed to supplement HTMX for more complex functionalities. Ultimately, the article suggests that while HTMX can be useful in certain scenarios, it is important to prototype and test its effectiveness before relying on it for complex client-side functionality.
