**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 The article discusses a scenario where a developer must choose between using Ruby on Rails or a low-code platform to develop a simple CRUD application for managing reservations. Here's a summary:

- **Initial Decision**: The developer considers using Ruby on Rails due to familiarity or a low-code tool for its supposed efficiency for simple tasks.

- **Low-Code Path**: 
  - The developer uses a low-code platform with a pre-existing template, customizing it quickly. Deployment is swift, but subsequent feature additions reveal limitations. Some features are easy to add through configuration, but others require complex workarounds or community help, leading to accidental bugs and a lack of automated testing, causing anxiety about releases.

- **Ruby on Rails Path**:
  - The developer sets up the application using Rails scaffolding, modifies code for better functionality, and ensures all tests pass. Additional features require custom coding, but this allows full control and the ability to refactor. The process is slower but more controlled with version control and testing, making it easier to adapt to new requirements or revert changes.

- **New Feature Challenge**: Both paths encounter a unique new feature not standard in typical reservation systems. The low-code solution requires significant hacks, whereas Rails, although requiring more initial setup, allows for a more tailored and flexible implementation.

The article highlights the trade-offs between rapid development with low-code tools versus the customization and control offered by traditional coding with frameworks like Ruby on Rails, especially when dealing with evolving project requirements.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations and appropriate uses of low-code development platforms. Low-code solutions are efficient for quick, simple projects like proofs of concept or personal utilities, but they become restrictive when scaling or when frequent updates and custom features are needed. The metaphor used compares extending a low-code solution to trying to reach the moon by climbing a tree; eventually, you can't go any further. Web development frameworks also have limits but are generally more flexible, allowing integration of custom code where needed. The piece advises that the choice between low-code, traditional frameworks, or completely custom development should be based on specific project needs, user expectations, and organizational capabilities. The author suggests maintaining an open mind towards different technologies and stresses that experience, often gained through trial and error, is crucial in making these decisions effectively.

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The Stack Exchange network, which includes Stack Overflow, provides various platforms for developers to interact, learn, and work collaboratively. Within this context, the article discusses the history of a well-known warning message in the Unix-like operating system's `sudo` command:

- **Introduction of the Warning Message**: The warning message seen when a user first uses `sudo` was introduced in June 1993 in the University of Colorado's version of sudo. This message includes reminders about respecting privacy, thinking before typing, and acknowledging the responsibility that comes with sudo privileges.

- **Origin and Development**: The message was part of a commit by Todd C. Miller, the maintainer of sudo. However, its origins trace back further, possibly to Bob Coggeshall or Evi Nemeth, as the message predates Miller's involvement. The initial version was slightly shorter than what is seen today.

- **Cultural Reference**: In January 2004, the quote "With great power comes great responsibility," often attributed to Stan Lee in relation to Spider-Man, was added to the warning by Red Hat, although it wasn't originally coined by Lee.

- **Historical Context**: Before its widespread adoption, sudo was developed and shared among a small group of individuals, with mentions of early versions posted in 1985 by Cliff Spencer and Don Gworek. The warning message reflects the ethos of system administration at academic institutions during that era.

- **Literature**: The UNIX System Administration Handbook by Evi Nemeth and others, which first published sudo, did not include the warning in the software itself but did discuss the responsibilities of sudo users via email reminders.

This article provides a historical overview of the sudo warning message, its evolution, and the cultural and academic context in which it was developed.
