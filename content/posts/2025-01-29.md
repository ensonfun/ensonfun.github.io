## 2. [OpenAI Furious DeepSeek Might Have Stolen All the Data OpenAI Stole from Us](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42865527)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 The article discusses accusations by OpenAI, Microsoft, and AI czar David Sacks against the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. They claim that DeepSeek developed its advanced large language model, R1, by unfairly using data from OpenAI's models, possibly through a technique called distillation where one AI model learns from another by asking it numerous questions. This practice, according to Sacks, effectively allows the student model to mimic and extract knowledge from the parent model, which he alleges DeepSeek did with OpenAI's technology. The irony highlighted in the article is that OpenAI itself has been criticized for similar practices, obtaining vast amounts of data from the internet often without explicit permission or in violation of terms of service, yet now complains when it perceives the same methods being used against them. This situation underscores a double standard in the AI industry regarding data usage ethics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 3. [Composable SQL](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42828883)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of SQL in handling complex queries and business logic, particularly focusing on two major issues:

1. **Testing SQL Queries**: Testing SQL is inherently difficult because even simple queries require a vast amount of test data. Each query depends on multiple columns and rows, necessitating the population of an entire object graph, which becomes exponentially complex with joins and deep queries. This leads to:
   - Uneven test coverage where simpler queries are tested but complex ones are not.
   - High maintenance cost due to the need for extensive test fixtures and the difficulty in maintaining and understanding these tests.

2. **Reusing Business Logic**: SQL's lack of abstraction means business logic must often be replicated across multiple queries or denormalized, leading to:
   - **Duplication of Logic**: Each query might need to include logic for computed properties, increasing the chance of inconsistencies as the logic evolves.
   - **Denormalization**: To manage this, one might denormalize data by pre-computing values, but this introduces new challenges like ensuring data consistency across the system.

The author proposes a solution involving **composable query fragments with statically-typed interfaces** to address these issues:
   - This would allow for the definition of logic once, making it easier to test and reuse across different queries.
   - It aims to reduce the need for duplicating logic and simplify testing by focusing on smaller, reusable components rather than entire object graphs.

Overall, the article critiques SQL's current capabilities in handling modern data needs and suggests an enhancement to make SQL more modular and testable, thereby improving both the development and maintenance of database-driven applications.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations and challenges of using views in PostgreSQL for query optimization. The author explains that ideally, PostgreSQL would inline views into a single, highly optimized query, but this often does not occur effectively. Here are the key points:

- **PostgreSQL's View Handling**: The database does not always manage to inline and optimize views into a "gigaquery" as hoped, leading to suboptimal query performance.

- **Comparison with Other Databases**: Unlike PostgreSQL, databases like Oracle and SQL Server are better at inlining views and optimizing the resulting query.

- **Issue with Views**: Views are inherently designed for general use, which means they cannot be parameterized, leading to inefficiencies when specific filtering is required post-view creation.

- **SQL Server's Solution**: SQL Server offers inline table-valued functions which act like parameterizable views, although they have their own limitations in terms of composability. For instance, direct composition of functions that return and accept tables isn't straightforward, often requiring intermediate storage.

- **Utility Despite Limitations**: Despite these issues, functions in SQL Server are highlighted as very useful for building complex queries that reuse logic.

Overall, the article points out a significant area where PostgreSQL could improve in handling views and suggests that while SQL Server provides a better alternative, it still has its own set of challenges in function composition.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the inefficiencies associated with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in PostgreSQL, particularly focusing on the lack of predicate pushdown which affects performance. Here are the key points:

1. **PostgreSQL's CTE Limitations**: The article critiques PostgreSQL for not effectively pushing down predicates in CTEs, leading to performance issues.

2. **Comparison with BigQuery**: The author contrasts PostgreSQL with Google BigQuery, where CTEs benefit from predicate pushdown, leading to predictable performance improvements. BigQuery also supports user-defined table functions, though these are not commonly used.

3. **Desired Features**: The author expresses a desire for better scoping capabilities in SQL, akin to how CTEs are structured, but also allowing for inline function definitions within SQL statements. This would enhance readability and manageability, especially in environments where separate function definitions are cumbersome.

4. **BigQuery's Additional Features**: BigQuery supports user-defined aggregate functions, which, while not often necessary, are highly beneficial when needed.

5. **Call for Feedback**: The author invites feedback from BigQuery developers, indicating a willingness to share insights on user experiences and potential improvements.

Overall, the article highlights a need for enhancements in how databases handle CTEs and function definitions to improve efficiency and user experience.

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 **Summary of the Article:**

The article discusses OAuth2, a widely-used authorization framework that enables users to securely share access to their data across different services without exposing their credentials. Here are the key points:

1. **OAuth2 Usage**: Many users unknowingly utilize OAuth2 when they log into websites using their Google, Facebook, or GitHub accounts.

2. **Simplicity for Users**: OAuth2 is designed to be user-friendly, making integration between applications straightforward without requiring users to understand the underlying protocol.

3. **Problem Solving**: The article explores the scenario of integrating a user's Git repositories into a deployment platform like Fly.io or Vercel. It discusses the initial, problematic solution of sharing user credentials and introduces alternatives like Personal Access Tokens (PATs).

4. **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**: PATs are an improvement over sharing main credentials as they can be limited in scope and lifespan, reducing security risks.

5. **OAuth2 vs. PATs**: While PATs simplify integration for users, OAuth2 offers a more automated and secure method for applications to request access to user data. OAuth2 focuses on delegation of access permissions, allowing users to control which applications can access their data and to what extent.

6. **Design Philosophy**: OAuth2 is built around the principle of empowering users to manage permissions for third-party applications, enhancing security and privacy by design.

The article concludes by highlighting the importance of OAuth2 in modern web services, where it streamlines the process of granting and managing access permissions, making it an integral part of the software ecosystem.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's interest in OAuth2 and OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocols, particularly enjoying an article titled "OAuth from First Principles" which explains the protocols in detail. The author appreciates how different explanations of these protocols can enhance understanding. However, in a critique section, the author points out a misuse of the term "Trust-on-first-use" (TOFU). They clarify that TOFU refers to a specific security scenario where initial trust is established without prior shared secrets, which can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, unlike the simple caching of authorization scopes as suggested in the article. The most common example of TOFU is described with SSH connections where keys are not initially verified.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article expresses frustration with the complexities and perceived unnecessary limitations of authentication systems, particularly in web development. The author criticizes:

1. **Complexity and Misimplementation**: The author finds authentication overly complicated and often incorrectly implemented, citing examples like not checking JWT (JSON Web Token) audiences.

2. **Lack of Understanding**: Developers frequently use libraries without understanding the underlying security mechanisms, which leads to poor security practices.

3. **User Experience (UX)**: From an application developer's perspective, the author desires a simple process where a user provides a token from a trusted source to prove identity and permissions. The method of token acquisition (e.g., via redirect or user action) should not require special labels or separate authorization flows, as this adds unnecessary complexity. 

The author essentially calls for a more straightforward, less jargon-filled approach to authentication that focuses on security and user ease rather than on convoluted procedures and terminology.

## 7. [Discovery Coding](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42860128)

**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

 The article introduces the concept of "discovery coding" in programming, paralleling it with the distinction between outline writers and discovery writers in literature. Here's a summary:

- **Discovery Coding vs. Outlining**: Discovery coders start writing code without a predefined plan, exploring the problem through coding itself. This contrasts with outline programmers who plan their approach before coding.

- **Cultural Perception**: There's a cultural bias towards structured methodologies in programming, similar to preferring outline writing in literature. Discovery coding is often seen as messy or undisciplined.

- **Process vs. End-Artifact**: The article argues that the method of creation (discovery coding) does not necessarily reflect the quality or structure of the final product. A discovery coder can produce well-structured code.

- **Design Approaches**: Discovery coding is not synonymous with bottom-up design, although there might be an overlap in preference. Top-down design focuses on the problem approach rather than the problem understanding process.

- **Benefits of Discovery Coding**: This approach helps avoid jumping to familiar solutions prematurely, instead allowing the coder to understand the system's constraints through interaction. This method suits those who find pre-written plans unhelpful or restrictive.

- **Tooling**: Current programming tools are not typically designed with discovery coding in mind. Features like live programming and system visualization could enhance this approach.

- **Community Acceptance**: The author calls for the programming community to recognize and accept discovery coding as a legitimate method, just as the writing community has accepted discovery writing.

The article emphasizes the importance of recognizing diverse coding styles and suggests that embracing these differences can lead to better problem-solving and creativity in software development.

**Total comment counts : 48**

### Summary

 **Summary of the Article:**

The article discusses DeepSeek, a Chinese AI lab, which developed R1, an open-source reasoning model that rivals OpenAI's proprietary model but was trained with significantly less resources. Here are the key points:

- **Why Open Source?**: DeepSeek chose to open-source its model despite having a potentially market-leading product, which might seem counterintuitive from a traditional business perspective. However, this decision was driven by:
  - **Trust and Market Access**: Being a Chinese company, there are concerns about data privacy and compliance in Western markets. Open-sourcing helps build trust by allowing users full control over the model.
  - **Resource Constraints**: Due to export controls on advanced hardware, DeepSeek had to innovate more efficient training methods, which are shared through open-source.

- **Market Dynamics**: 
  - Open-source models are gaining traction as they offer similar performance at a lower cost compared to proprietary models like those from OpenAI. 
  - The commoditization of LLMs means that the performance differences between models are lessening, making cost a significant factor.

- **Infrastructure vs. Consumer Software**: 
  - In infrastructure, open-source is often preferred because it requires customization and maintenance regardless of whether it's proprietary or not. Engineers benefit from being able to audit and modify the codebase.
  - However, for consumer products, the maintenance burden of open-source can be a deterrent.

- **Future of AI**: 
  - Despite the rise of open-source models, proprietary AI like OpenAI's still holds advantages due to first-mover status and the foundational work that has enabled newer models through techniques like LLM distillation.

- **Conclusion**: While open-source models like DeepSeek's R1 challenge the dominance of proprietary models, the latter still have a role due to their pioneering work and market positioning. However, the trend towards open-source in AI infrastructure is clear, driven by cost, customization, and the inherent nature of technical products needing user control and transparency.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses DeepSeek, a Chinese startup focusing on large language models (LLMs), which has chosen to remain open source. Unlike other major Chinese tech companies like ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba, which also work on LLMs but keep their models proprietary, DeepSeek has opted not to commercialize its technology or raise capital, instead focusing on community engagement and organic growth through open-source contributions. This approach, according to the CEO, helps in attracting top talent and emphasizes the value of the team, similar to the early days of OpenAI before it shifted towards a more closed model under Microsoft's influence. The article highlights that while this choice initially kept DeepSeek in obscurity, its commitment to open source has begun to gain recognition and traction within the community by November 2024.

 The article appears to be a brief query or statement questioning whether a certain entity only made available the weights of a model, similar to what others have done, rather than fully open-sourcing the entire model or codebase.

## 9. [Seagate: 'new' hard drives used for tens of thousands of hours](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42864788)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The German publication Heise.de has reported potential fraud involving Seagate hard drives sold as new but found to be heavily used. Readers who purchased Seagate Exos HDDs from various retailers, including official Seagate retailers, discovered through FARM tests that these drives had been used for thousands of hours, contrary to what was advertised. These drives, identified as OEM models rather than retail, did not come with the expected five-year warranty. Seagate is investigating the issue, which seems to involve multiple retailers and a significant number of drives, with usage ranging from 15,000 to 50,000 hours. The situation raises questions about whether there was intentional misrepresentation or a significant error in inventory management. Seagate has not commented on the issue yet, but they do engage in selling refurbished drives through an official eBay store in the US, which does not seem connected to this particular problem.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how to access FARM logs on Seagate hard drives using the command `smartctl -l farm /dev/sd<n>`. These logs are considered more reliable than the standard SMART statistics. The author mentions that their two relatively new 16TB Seagate Exos drives, with dates of manufacture in June 2021, showed a discrepancy in usage hours: zero hours according to regular stats but approximately 18,000 hours according to FARM logs. Additionally, when trying to format these drives with ZFS, it failed because the drives were already formatted as part of a DDF (Disk Data Format) RAID setup.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's preference for buying used Western Digital Ultrastar drives from Amazon for their NAS (Network Attached Storage) system over new Seagate Exos drives due to several reasons:

1. **Cost and Reliability**: Used Ultrastar drives are cheaper and have proven reliable, especially with RAID-6 configuration which allows for two drive failures.

2. **Quick Replacement**: It's faster to replace a failed drive by purchasing from Amazon than waiting for an OEM warranty replacement.

3. **Backblaze Data**: The author references Backblaze's data, which shows that Ultrastar drives have a good reliability record.

4. **Reseller Reliability**: The reseller on Amazon seems trustworthy.

5. **Remanufactured Drives**: There's evidence suggesting that many "remanufactured" drives might actually be OEM products with high no-trouble-found rates when returned, indicating they might work perfectly well.

The author sees an additional benefit in knowing they are buying used drives, which aligns with their understanding of the typical quality of returned hardware.
