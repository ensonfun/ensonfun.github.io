**Total comment counts : 54**

### Summary

 The author of the article discovered an interesting component while browsing the internet. They attempted to understand the implementation of the component by examining the source code, which was minified. Instead of trying to understand the code themselves, they decided to ask ChatGPT to explain it. ChatGPT provided an explanation of the different parts and functionalities of the code. The author then asked for an equivalent code in TypeScript, and ChatGPT provided a readable implementation. The author initially thought that ChatGPT didn't accurately replicate the logic of the code, but it turned out to be a copy-paste error with some characters. After correcting the code, the output matched the original component. The author apologized for accusing ChatGPT of mistakes.

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 The article discusses Skip, a tool that allows developers to use Swift, a programming language for iOS, to build native apps for both iOS and Android. Developers can use Xcode, the main iOS development environment, to build their apps, and Skip will continuously translate the code into Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, the equivalent technologies for Android. Skip apps are truly native, providing the same performance and user interface as apps built specifically for each platform. Developers can inspect and customize the Kotlin source code generated by Skip, and the resulting Android app only requires a few open-source Skip libraries. The transpiler also converts unit tests, ensuring consistent performance across platforms. Skip also provides free and open-source implementations of iOS frameworks like Foundation and SwiftUI for Android. Developers can use Android Studio to further customize the generated code. Skip aims to provide a seamless development experience for iOS developers venturing into Android app development.

## 10. [HDMI Forum rejects AMD's HDMI 2.1 open-source driver](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41386667)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 AMD's open-source Linux graphics driver is unable to support HDMI 2.1+ due to legal requirements from the HDMI Forum. Despite attempts to find a solution, the HDMI Forum has rejected AMD's proposal, leaving Linux users without the ability to use advanced features like 4K@120Hz and 5K@240Hz via HDMI 2.1. AMD recommends using DisplayPort instead. The HDMI Forum restricted public access to its specifications, hindering open-source driver support. AMD spent months developing code and seeking approval from the HDMI Forum, but their request for open-source driver support was denied. AMD may need to explore alternative solutions, but for now, Linux users are advised to use DisplayPort for the best experience.
