## 2. [1 bug, $50k in bounties, a Zendesk backdoor](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41818459)

**Total comment counts : 59**

### Summary

 Daniel, a 15-year-old programmer, discovered a serious vulnerability in Zendesk, a popular customer service tool used by many Fortune 500 companies. Zendesk manages support emails and creates tickets, but its setup can create security gaps, especially if companies use their email domain for Single Sign-On (SSO). Daniel found that by spoofing emails, attackers could gain access to any company’s support tickets on Zendesk by sending crafted emails. Despite reporting the flaw through Zendesk's bug bounty program, his report was initially dismissed as it was deemed "out of scope." Frustrated by this, he sought greater impact and decided not to alert individual affected companies, choosing instead to refer to a blog post that outlined previous exploits involving Zendesk. Ultimately, he illustrates the significant security risks associated with relying on third-party tools like Zendesk without adequate safeguards.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reported a bug to Zendesk, Apple, and Slack in June 2024, questioning why they didn't receive a payout, suggesting they were not the first to report it. The critical problem lies with non-directory Single Sign-On (SSO) options, such as Sign in with Apple (SIWA), which have been poorly implemented across many companies. Unlike directory SSO options (e.g., Google SSO), which can verify account control, non-directory options rely on weaker proof of control, usually linked to email at a given moment. The author argues that SSO providers should not be treated equally, and that many services fail to properly consider these differences when designing their trust models.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes Zendesk for allegedly creating a fake band called "Zendesk Alternative" to manipulate search engine results against alternatives to their services. While this tactic isn't illegal, the author views it as a reflection of Zendesk's petty and manipulative mindset.

## 3. [Psilocybin bests SSRI for major depression in first long-term comparison](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41818420)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 A recent study presented at the 37th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress suggests that psilocybin is more effective than the SSRI escitalopram for treating moderate to severe major depressive disorder (MDD) in terms of overall well-being. This research is the first long-term comparison of these two treatments, focusing on a broader perspective of patient recovery beyond just alleviating symptoms of depression.

The study involved 59 adults with MDD who were randomly assigned to receive either two doses of psilocybin or daily escitalopram along with psychological support over six weeks. Initial results indicated that while both treatments had similar effects on depressive symptoms, psilocybin showed superior benefits in aspects such as social functioning, meaning in life, and overall happiness, with fewer side effects.

The follow-up after six months highlighted continued improvements for psilocybin recipients in social adjustment and life meaning, while both treatments maintained similar depressive symptom scores. Notably, adverse effects from psilocybin were primarily mild, whereas escitalopram led to a broader range of side effects.

The findings imply that psilocybin could offer a more holistic approach to treating depression, aligning better with patient priorities regarding life quality and functionality. However, some participants in both groups received additional interventions, which may have affected the results. Overall, researchers advocate for the potential integration of psilocybin into therapeutic practices, noting it could significantly enhance the quality of life for those with MDD.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article critiques a study comparing the effects of psilocybin and SSRIs on depression, noting the small sample sizes of 25 and 21 participants, respectively. It questions the methodology, highlighting that the psilocybin group received 20 hours of in-person therapy and follow-up calls, while the SSRI group only completed a questionnaire after six months. The author raises concerns about whether any psychological changes in the psilocybin group were due to the drug alone or the therapy, and criticizes the reliance on a self-administered 16-question depression survey for measuring results despite participants being diagnosed with major depression by a doctor.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article conveys a personal testimony about the life-changing effects of psilocybin. The author shares that psilocybin has helped them overcome suicidal thoughts and alcoholism, leading to a state of general peace and gratitude for their life.

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves is the oldest continuously existing organization dedicated to apprehending horse thieves in the United States, founded in Dedham, Massachusetts, in 1810. Originally formed to combat a high incidence of horse theft, it has had over 10,000 members, including notable figures like heads of state and Supreme Court justices. Initially, membership was restricted to prominent community members but has since opened up, allowing anyone to join after paying a fee.

The society held its first meeting at Marsh's Tavern and later changed its name in 1814 to its current title. It opened a bank account in 1832, which may be the oldest active account in the U.S. Although it believed until recently that it was the oldest horse thief apprehending society, another society in Red Hook, founded earlier, prompted a gracious acknowledgment from Dedham's members.

Over the years, membership criteria have relaxed, and by 2022, the organization had over 10,700 members. Meetings initially occurred at local taverns, but the society continues its activities today in a tax-exempt, nonprofit capacity, meeting "just in case." The organization has preserved its historical significance while adapting to modern times.

## 10. [The revival of the beach in twentieth-century Los Angeles](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41791663)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 Santa Monica Beach, now a renowned destination with over 4.6 million visitors in 2023, has undergone significant transformation from its rocky origins in the early 1900s. At that time, city officials aimed to develop it into a luxurious resort akin to Miami. To address overcrowding, they expanded the beach by trucked sand, leading to the dumping of over 13.4 million cubic meters of sediment between 1939 and 1957, which succeeded in creating wide expanses of beach.

However, climate change poses a threat to these beaches, with projections suggesting that Southern California could lose one to two-thirds of its shorelines by 2100 due to rising sea levels. Current maintenance practices, including routine beach grooming, further hinder biodiversity and natural coastal resilience.

To combat these challenges, Tom Ford from The Bay Foundation has initiated a project to restore native sand dunes by halting beach grooming and planting native species. This approach aims to create natural barriers against erosion while promoting ecosystem health. The initial efforts have shown promise, as plants are establishing and capturing sand, thereby reinforcing the shoreline.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the practice of beach sand replenishment along the California coastline, particularly from San Diego to Carlsbad and Oceanside. This process involves dredging sand every few decades and depositing it back onto the beaches to maintain sand levels and support tourism.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a foundation's efforts to halt beach grooming to restore native plant communities and sand dunes, which can help with erosion. However, the author expresses concerns that without regular grooming, the beaches would become dirty due to litter from beachgoers. They note that the newly restored dunes have attracted homeless individuals, leading to unsanitary conditions. The author advocates for a coordinated effort to both restore the dunes and address issues like littering and homelessness, although they are skeptical about this happening.
