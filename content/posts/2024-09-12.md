### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author used the GPT-4 model via ChatGPT to reverse engineer the binary bluetooth protocol of their kitchen fan in order to integrate it into Home Assistant. Although the initial model was helpful, it couldn't determine the transmission pattern of the fan's remaining runtime in a certain mode. However, when the author used the same prompt with the o1-preview and o1-mini models, they were able to correctly decode the pattern using a slightly different method. The models also determined that the author's code was equivalent to what they had reverse engineered. Testing the prompt with the gpt4o model resulted in the same findings as the GPT-4 model used in April. The author finds the progress to be amazing.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of a "hidden chain of thought" in monitoring models. It explains that this hidden chain of thought allows for understanding the thought process of the model, but it should not be altered or made visible to users. The decision is made not to show the raw chains of thought to users due to factors such as user experience and competitive advantage. Instead, the model is taught to reproduce useful ideas from the chain of thought in its answer. The article also summarizes the evolution of models from GPT-2 to GPT-4, with each iteration having different features and capabilities.

### Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of creating hand-drawn style wireframes quickly and easily. It emphasizes the importance of expressing and communicating ideas quickly, without spending excessive time and effort on low-fidelity wireframes. Hand-drawn style wireframes reduce the stress of achieving perfection and allow for quick idea expression. The article mentions the ability to create various types of diagrams, such as flowcharts, UML diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams. It also highlights the usefulness of drawing user flows, information architecture, and data models in one place. The tool offers a wide range of UI component shapes, icons, and templates for different platforms. Additionally, the wireframes can be presented as a slide show. The tool allows users to create master frames and reuse them in multiple locations. When the master frame is updated, all the mirrors will be automatically updated as well.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is questioning why wireframing tools often use a "sketch-like hand-drawn pencil" style. They understand that wireframing is a brainstorming tool typically done with a pencil and whiteboard in a meeting room, but they wonder why this style continues when using a computer. They suggest using a more realistic and clean look instead. The author wonders if designers are simply used to this style or if it helps emphasize essential points and avoid unnecessary discussion about minor design details.

They suggest investing in a good quality soldering iron, thin gauge solder, and a solid parts holder to make soldering more enjoyable and improve the output. The article states that it is not necessary to spend a lot of money, but using better tools will make a significant difference in the experience and outcome of soldering.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is a fan of the pinecil and has been using it for years. They find it convenient to use their laptop's power supply or a mobile battery instead of moving to their soldering station. They mention some upgrades in other soldering devices compared to the pinecil, such as a comfier grip, shorter tip length, higher power over usb-c, and a storage cap for tight spaces. However, they believe the lack of on-iron temperature settings is a dealbreaker. They value the portability of the pinecil and how it works with their existing usb-c cables and batteries without requiring extra space. They feel that the need for a proprietary battery or a laptop to change temperature would break its portability.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article reflects on the hype surrounding memristors, which are passive components that combine electrical charge and magnetical flux. The concept of memristors was explored over 50 years ago, but they did not scale up the clock speeds sufficiently to be competitive. The author notes that early technology is risky because if improvements cannot be found in all dimensions, the technology is likely to fail.

## 9. [Kolmogorov-Arnold networks may make neural networks more understandable](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41519240)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 Neural networks, while powerful tools in artificial intelligence, have always had a disadvantage: they are often referred to as black boxes because humans can't understand how they arrive at their conclusions. However, a recent study introduced a new neural network design called a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) that is more transparent yet can accomplish almost everything a regular neural network can. KANs are based on a mathematical idea from the mid-20th century and are more interpretable, making them attractive for scientific applications. Unlike traditional neural networks, KANs use edge functions instead of numerical weights, allowing them to represent more complicated curves and be tweaked more sensitively. Although KANs were previously thought to be impractical, this new research has sparked widespread interest.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a tutorial session at an academic conference focused on the intersection of hardware/semiconductor design and machine learning/deep learning. The session focused on KANs (Knowledge Augmented Neural Networks) and their potential applications in gaining insight and interpreting physical systems. While KANs can be useful for science and mathematics, it may not be the main priority for engineering applications. There are still unknowns in leaning hard tasks and learning capacity over harder problems, as well as choices in basis functions and other architectures that KANs can be used with. Further exploration and experimentation with KANs are needed to find better answers to these questions.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of understanding complex systems, particularly in the context of artificial neural networks. It argues that just because one part of a network can be understood, it doesn't mean that the entire network can be understood. The example of decision trees is used to illustrate this point, noting that while smaller decision trees were once considered understandable, today's massive decision trees created using approaches like random forests are not interpretable. The article emphasizes that there is a fundamental gap in our ability to understand complex systems, and introducing new network types does not solve this issue.

## 10. [Reader-LM: Small Language Models for Cleaning and Converting HTML to Markdown](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41515730)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses the release of Jina Reader in April 2024, which is an API that converts any URL into markdown. The process involves fetching the webpage source, extracting the main content, and converting it into markdown. However, there were issues with the content quality, leading to the exploration of using small language models (SLMs) for data cleaning. The article introduces reader-lm-0.5b and reader-lm-1.5b, two SLMs trained to generate clean markdown from raw HTML. Despite their small size, these models outperform larger language models and support a context length of up to 256K tokens. The article provides specifications and instructions for using the models and mentions their availability on Azure Marketplace and AWS SageMaker. It also compares the performance of Reader-LM with other large language models using various metrics. The models are evaluated on different dimensions and Reader-LM-1.5B consistently performs well.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is skeptical about the reasoning behind using a custom-made LLM (Limited Language Model) instead of regular expressions. They argue that although regular expressions may be difficult to reason about, relying on LLMs can be even more challenging for many developers. The idea that using LLMs makes code more maintainable is seen as ironic by the author.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article tried out the 1.5b model in the example notebook on Colab but did not get good results. While the model was impressively fast, when the author tested it on an arxiv.org page, it only returned a short markdown file with the abstract, "View PDF" link, and submission history. The model completely missed the title, authors, and other links that are present in the HTML of the page. The author questions why this is the case, considering arxiv.org is a common example in web applications.
