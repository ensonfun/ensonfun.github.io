## 1. [Show HN: Non.io, a Reddit-like platform Ive been working on for the last 4 years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36296695)

**Total comment counts : 163**

### Summary

 Nonio is a new platform that functions like Reddit where your subscription fee is split between everything you upvote each month to reward creators for their content. $1 of your subscription goes to running the servers and the remaining amount is split equally among the content you upvote at the end of the month. The service is ad-free and without cookies or third-party networks tracking you. You can browse for free and interact for just $2 per month. There are no paywalls on Nonio, and creators receive a share of your subscription fee if you upvote their content. Nonio aims to reward creators and discourage low-effort content by promoting high-quality content. The platform is launching with images, blogs, videos, and HTML, with audio content coming soon. Nonio is a solo project of Jacob Miller (jjcm), who aims to provide a high-quality user experience and prioritize user demands over advertisers' demands.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes a newly developed tech platform, stating that without innovative or unique features, it lacks the potential for success due to oversaturation in the tech market. Additionally, the upfront subscription model discourages user growth, and lack of interesting content from the start means that the user will likely lose interest and abandon the site. The author suggests that the platform needs to focus on creating a user experience that entices and engages users in order to have a better chance at success.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential consequences of the idea of rewarding posters with real money instead of internet points if their posts become successful. While it is an interesting idea, serious moderation will be necessary to prevent low-quality content and spam from inundating the platform, and to avoid the danger of moderators taking bribes. The article suggests that the introduction of real money to the internet often leads to negative consequences, and therefore, it will take considerable effort to prevent these consequences from occurring. Finally, the author suggests that a guarantee of immunity from negative effects, such as spam, and the possibility of an IPO, would be popular if the platform becomes successful.

Finally, the article offers instructions for converting the resulting png files into either animated gifs or mp4 videos.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author had planned to buy a 4090 graphics card, but decided against it as 24gb VRAM would not be sufficient in the future. Instead, the author bought a 3060 for a fraction of the cost and plans to use Colab until a 6090 with 128gb VRAM is available. The author questions the obsession with small computers/servers, stating that they don't mind having a larger computer. The author intends to use Colab for most tasks but wants to explore AI art with their partner using their new graphics card.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that the issue with temporal cohesion needs to be resolved before any further action is taken. The results are impressive, but due to the variety in frames, it creates a distracting art style rather than true animation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author finds it concerning that a browser would use super resolution by default. They worry that it could cause issues when viewing medical images or text in images by adding false details that aren't there. They express surprise that Microsoft's legal review would approve such a potentially dangerous idea.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is critical of the initial setup process for Windows 10, saying that it forced them to create a Microsoft account, sign up for free trials, and repeatedly push them to use Edge over Chrome. The UI also includes features like Bing search on the taskbar and desktop. The author is frustrated by this and claims that the experience was so annoying that they would choose Linux over Windows 10 if they didn't already have a Mac.

## 4. [Reddit.com appears to be having an outage](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36294244)

**Total comment counts : 99**

### Summary

 The article discusses the technical issues behind Reddit's recent downtime and suggests that the root problem may lie in the platform's original architecture, specifically around its cache invalidation system and the handling of listing retrieval. The author suggests that the founding team lacked technical expertise and that the site's infrastructure was developed in a haphazard way without proper research and planning. Ultimately, the article argues that the system may no longer be capable of handling the demands placed on it and may require an overhaul.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author notes that there is speculation on Twitter about the recent glitch on Reddit, which some believe was a failed attempt to reopen closed subreddits and reinstate moderators. However, the author thinks it's more likely that the Reddit team was taking advantage of reduced traffic to make larger changes, which may have resulted in the glitch.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article visited Reddit and found that most of the site was rebelling due to the way it was being handled. The author believes that Reddit's handling of the situation is tone-deaf and showed casual hostility directed at their users. The author was greeted by a message that they broke Reddit and given a grade of 'F'. The author found this to be in poor taste, especially considering the circumstances, and believes it shows the entitled mindset of Reddit's leadership.

## 5. [Did Reddit just destroy mobile browser access?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36287411)

**Total comment counts : 95**

### Summary

 The article is a request for tech support on Reddit's subreddit dedicated to answering questions about Reddit tech issues. The user logged into Reddit on their iPhone browser but was suddenly logged out an hour ago, with no option to log back in and a banner suggesting they use the app. The desktop website still shows they are logged in, but browsing is almost non-functional. The user requests a solution to this issue.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author questions the benefit of forcing mobile browser users into mobile apps as it would result in being limited to a walled garden where the app store earns a hefty "app store tax" while controlling the app's style to suit their interests. Although having an app could provide marketing benefits, developers should consider modern web standards as they could achieve everything they need. The author suggests that users who frequently use their browser would still see the app's logo on the "New Tabs" page anyway.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author refused to install the Reddit app for many years as they prefer browsing on websites. When Reddit forced them to use the app for a week, it reduced their usage of Reddit significantly.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 MIDI 2.0 is a significant revision to the well-established MIDI protocol used across musical devices. The update aims to improve and modernize the original MIDI protocol.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of having better midi clock synchronization with class compliant USB midi devices that use Jitter correction and "interrupt driven" transfers instead of the low priority bulk transfer mode used in USB midi 1.0. However, DAWs would need to use the new APIs and send midi events some milliseconds early to take advantage of the jitter correction, which may require manual adjustments. The hope is that there will be a way for the Alsa client to determine these adjustments automatically.

## 7. [The Surprising Power of Documentation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36287809)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of documentation in startups and explains how it can save time, increase productivity, and encourage collaborative decision-making processes. It suggests that a documentation-first culture should be cultivated, where knowledge is dispersed and accessible to the entire organization, preventing silos and increasing efficiency. The article also advocates for reducing reliance on meetings, as clear documentation can eliminate the need for clarification. Finally, it suggests that the CTO should lead by example, encouraging and facilitating a documentation-first environment.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article stresses the importance of tailoring documentation to the audience and suggests three types of documentation: user, admin, and architecture. User docs should be simple and explain how to use the system, while admin docs should cover installation and troubleshooting. Architecture docs should explain the system's construction and technology choices. The article warns that overly complex documentation can be useless and lead users to seek information elsewhere. Good companies focus on creating effective documentation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that while documentation is important, it can be expensive to create and maintain. The author suggests taking a more measured approach, writing only the necessary documentation for prototypes and more detailed documentation for production-ready features. They also recommend hiring a dedicated team for documentation when necessary and using a ratio of 1:3:5 for lines of code, tests, and documentation. The author highlights that they are the creator of documentation.page and documentation.agency.

## 8. [How to make a QR code with Stable Diffusion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36285630)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article discusses how to create QR codes using Stable Diffusion, a machine learning platform. The process involves generating an image similar to the QR code using img2img, using ControlNet during the sampling steps to imprint the QR code onto the image, and adjusting parameters to blend the QR code and prompt well. While not all QR codes work the same, generating more images and checking for keepers increases the chance of success. The article includes step-by-step instructions and guidelines to help individuals use Stable Diffusion effectively.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) art should be challenging for humans but manageable for computers, producing impressive visuals while also being functional. The author suggests that this method of creation is similar to how human artists work, with constraints and limitations on the process. They also propose incorporating a QR reader into the training loop to increase the valid output of the AI.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how QR codes can encode the same content in different ways and still maintain their semantic meaning, which could allow for greater freedom in diffusion models. Different-looking QR codes can be generated by changing the QR encoding itself or even tweaking the content itself while maintaining its meaning.

## 9. [Every Signature Is Broken: Insecurity of Microsoft Office’s Ooxml Signatures](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36292413)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 error

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that there are misconceptions about signatures that are built into older standards, and these misconceptions make it easy for attackers to target XML signatures, email signatures, and PDF files. The article suggests that signatures should be applied to whole files or data structures, and complex formats where signatures are allowed to sign sub-parts of the information are fragile and should be considered dangerous unless proven otherwise.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author encountered a problem where critical software was erroneously signing and validating the wrong part of a security-sensitive message, which they reported to their company. They also discovered that on macOS, Microsoft Office indicates that a document is protected by a signature, but the signature is not validated. The author wonders if this issue was discovered during the implementation of a MacOS port and if the signature validation behavior was removed in the implementation. They also question if this vulnerability was exploited in the wild and led to forged invoices or banking details being changed. The company acknowledged the author's report and awarded them a bug bounty.

## 10. [El Paquete Semanal](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36285363)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 El Paquete Semanal, or "The Weekly Package," is a collection of digital content distributed on the underground market in Cuba to serve as a substitute for broadband internet. It contains a variety of content such as TV shows, music, films, and classified ads. With only a 38.8% internet penetration rate as of 2018, El Paquete has become the primary source of entertainment for millions in Cuba. The government has attempted to create its own media package called Mochila or Maletín, but it was ultimately unpopular. It is unknown who creates El Paquete, and some theorize that the government may be involved.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses how the US attempted to block Cuba from accessing the internet and still uses various means to prevent them from accessing it. However, the perception is that the suppression of content is of Cuban origin. The article draws similarities to when the US initially prevented Cubans from leaving the country, but then demanded that Cuba stops letting its citizens leave when it was discovered that many of them were prisoners or mental patients.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The internet in Cuba is limited not only due to government rules and regulations, but also because of US sanctions that block access to some platforms like Zoom. Cuba's internet connection is through the ALBA-1 cable to Venezuela, as the US does not permit an undersea cable to pass 100 miles from Cuba to Florida.
