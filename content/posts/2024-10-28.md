**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 A significant treasure find in southwestern England, comprising 2,584 Norman-era silver coins, has been purchased for £4.3 million ($5.6 million) by a local heritage trust, making it Britain’s most valuable treasure find to date. Discovered five years ago by a group of seven metal detectorists in the Chew Valley, the coins date back to around 1066-1068, a pivotal time during the Norman Conquest. The hoard features images of King Edward the Confessor and King Harold II, reflecting the turmoil of the era, including Harold's struggle against William the Conqueror. The coins are believed to have been buried for safekeeping during rebellions against William. The find is significant as it includes twice as many coins from Harold II's reign than previously discovered. They will be displayed at the British Museum starting November 26 before returning to southwest England museums.

## 3. [Becoming physically immune to brute-force attacks (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41940663)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article explores the relationship between thermal physics, cosmology, and computer science to determine the strength a password must have to make brute-force attacks physically impossible in the future. It introduces the concept of the "Mother of All Computers" (MOAC), which represents the theoretical limit of a computer's power constrained by the energy available in the observable universe. 

The strength of a password is measured by its entropy bits, where a password with n bits of entropy can be cracked with certainty by a brute-force attack executing 2n guesses. The piece emphasizes that advancements in supercomputers necessitate continual updates to password strength recommendations. For current industry standards, AES-256 encryption, a 256-bit key length is used, which represents a strong baseline.

To evaluate password strength against the MOAC, the article defines a function to calculate the probability that the MOAC can guess a password given its entropy and energy used. It indicates that while quantum computing could speed up attacks via Grover's algorithm, this discussion focuses purely on brute-force attacks without considering the complexities of modern encryption methods.

Overall, the article invites readers to contemplate the future of password security through a scientific lens, recognizing that password strength must evolve alongside technological advancements.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their observations of NotebookLM's podcast-like episodes, believing that Google has developed a model that simulates a two-speaker podcast conversation using existing multimodal data. The speakers mimic natural human-like interruptions and overlap effectively. The author theorizes that this model was fine-tuned using a large collection of actual podcast transcripts and perhaps synthetic inputs generated from these transcripts. They suggest a potential workflow where a podcast episode is summarized by a language model, which is then fed into the two-speaker model to produce a transcript, allowing for analysis of alignment between the two. The author expresses curiosity about how the model achieves its natural sound, suspecting it cannot solely originate from text transcripts.

## 5. [For the strongest disc golf throws, it's all in the thumbs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41932244)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Zachary Lindsey, a physicist at Berry College in Georgia, conducted an experiment to optimize thumb placement for improving speed and torque in disc golf throws. By recruiting 24 participants, the study found that amateur players achieved the best results with their thumbs positioned about 3 centimeters from the disc's outer edge. The research, published in AIP Advances, highlights the significance of grip in disc golf, which has seen increasing popularity since the 1960s, with over 107,000 registered members in the Professional Disc Golf Association as of 2023. The team focused on backhand throws, measuring spin rate, launch speed, and torque with various thumb positions. Results indicated a strong correlation between spin rate and launch speed, suggesting the 3 cm thumb placement as a good starting point for amateur players.

## 9. [Cheap light transformed civilization](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41921802)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses the evolution of artificial light throughout human history, emphasizing how fire was the only source of light for millennia and illustrating the challenges of its production and maintenance. Initially, artificial light was an expensive luxury, particularly for the poor. For example, in 1302 CE, the cost of artificial light in the UK was equivalent to over £40,000 for a million-lumen hours. High-quality candles, like beeswax ones, were out of reach for most due to their cost and labor-intensive production.

The article highlights key milestones in lighting technology, showing how significant improvements occurred over time—from sesame oil lamps in 1750 BC to modern compact fluorescent bulbs, where an hour of labor today produces more light than an entire day's worth in the past.

Whale oil emerged during the Industrial Revolution as a bright and portable light source, although it was expensive and led to overhunting of whales. The introduction of paraffin wax and other oil-based lighting significantly reduced the cost of artificial light. Gas lighting also appeared but was costly and problematic to maintain.

Overall, the article illustrates the dramatic changes in lighting access and technology, showcasing how industrial advancements transformed what was once an arduous and privileged source of illumination into the ubiquitous convenience we enjoy today.
