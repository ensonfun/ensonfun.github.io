## 1. [Starlink's laser system is beaming 42 petabytes of data per day](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39200323)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 SpaceX engineer Travis Brashears revealed that the company's Starlink laser system is delivering over 42 petabytes of data, or 42 million gigabytes, per day to customers. The laser system, which consists of 9,000 lasers, helps reduce latency and improve coverage for Starlink's high-speed internet service. Despite the technical challenges, the system boasts a laser link uptime of over 99%. SpaceX plans to expand its laser system to be installed on third-party satellites and explore direct data delivery to Earth's surface. The company recently upgraded the laser technology to a new "Gen 4" model, which can manufacture about 200 units per week using off-the-shelf components.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the data transmission capabilities of a satellite internet network. It mentions that the network has a capacity of 432 Mbit/s per laser, with a total of 9000 lasers. The author finds this statement more relatable than saying the network can transmit 42 PB/day. It is noted that each laser can sustain a 100 Gbps or even 200 Gbps connection per link, but these lasers are generally underused, operating at only 0.432% of their maximum capacity. This is because ideal conditions for achieving 100 Gbps are rare, and the laser links are used in bursts lasting seconds or minutes until the satellites move out of line of sight. The article also mentions that with 2.3 million customers, each customer gets an average speed of 1.7 Mbit/s or 550 GB per month, which is considered high compared to the average American internet user's consumption of less than 100 GB/month.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the progress made by a company that launched its first satellites in 2019. The author finds it impressive that after just five years, the company is discussing different routing options for data streams to remote areas. They compare this progress to the installation of landlines, which were initially seen as a utopian dream but quickly became a common part of everyone's life.

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 The iOS developer of Apollo and Pixel Pals created a YouTube client app called Juno for visionOS. The app uses YouTube's embed API, allowing it to load videos in a web view and interact with them using JavaScript. While Juno presents the YouTube website with some tweaks to match the visionOS theme, it doesn't feel like a perfectly native visionOS app. However, it provides a better experience than using the website directly. Juno also supports detecting aspect ratios of videos and can resize the window accordingly. The app is available on the App Store for a one-time payment of $5, and feedback from users is welcome.

Tan initially dismissed his comments as a joke but has since apologized for his behavior. He has not, however, addressed the threatening letters. Some individuals, while critical of Tan's actions, believe that the responsibility lies with those who sent the anonymous mailer, not Tan himself.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses concern over the comments suggesting that certain behavior is both normal and acceptable. The author disagrees with this perspective and emphasizes the importance of recognizing the meaning and consequences of words. They argue that while such behavior may be typical among adolescents, adults should understand the significance of showing respect or decency towards others, even when in disagreement. Specifically, the author finds it unsettling that individuals would wish harm upon others, even if it is done rhetorically, as it reflects a lack of respect and decency.

## 7. [We built our customer data warehouse all on Postgres](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39213309)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Tembo built their customer data warehouse on Postgres using foreign data wrappers and other Postgres extensions. They wanted to track and understand customer usage and behavior by bringing data from multiple sources into a single location. Instead of using external orchestration tools, Tembo used Postgres extensions to enhance efficiency and simplify the process. They also released their tools as open source projects and made it easy for others to build a similar data warehouse using Tembo Cloud. The article further explains how Tembo pulled operational data from external sources into Postgres, and how they used foreign data wrappers to connect to sources like Prometheus and Clerk. They provide a walkthrough of the setup process for creating foreign data wrappers and foreign tables. Tembo also emphasizes the importance of keeping the data warehouse up-to-date with new user signups and instances.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses regret for using pg_cron as a tool for pulling and cleaning data in PostgreSQL. They argue that relying on complex queries or functions in PostgreSQL instead of using an external server is problematic in the long run. They cite difficulties in testing and making changes as well as the risk of crucial logic living outside of the code. Additionally, the author suggests that using PostgreSQL for logic work instead of utilizing cheaper resources like EC2 instances or serverless functions can be unpredictable and costly. The author's general rule is to use PostgreSQL primarily as a data store and not for other purposes, such as a permissions layer or API server. They mention their disinterest in Supabase for similar reasons and offer feedback to the Tembo team regarding the lack of a pricing page for their free trial.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author advises against using a Postgres database for analytics for several reasons. First, if your data is small enough for Postgres to handle it, the cost of using a more powerful analytics warehouse like BigQuery would also be small. Additionally, managing the infrastructure yourself can be complex, so it is more efficient to use a warehouse and focus on building your product instead. Secondly, Postgres doesn't scale well for analytics, so they only retain 30 days of metrics, which may not be sufficient for most businesses. In contrast, BigQuery offers affordable storage costs even at large scale. Finally, the author suggests using tools like Fivetran or Airbyte for maintaining data pipelines, as they are simpler to set up and support a wide range of data sources. The author acknowledges that Fivetran can become expensive as you scale, but there are other options available that can help reduce costs.

## 8. [Tailwind color palette generator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39227831)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 This article explains how a new tool works for creating color palettes. The tool allows users to set an initial value as a valid hexadecimal color, which can be changed to any stop from 50-950. The tool also provides options for shifting the hue, increasing saturation, and adjusting the lightness or luminance to create a spread of colors. The principles behind the tool are inspired by the book "Refactoring UI" and aim to fast-track the creation of new palettes. The tool can be accessed via an API and is particularly useful for design tools that need to generate a 50-950 palette from a single hex value. However, the tool does not currently offer options for HSL tweaks. The tool was developed by Simeon Griggs.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of integrating accessibility considerations into design tools. The author suggests a method of defining color palettes that would indicate whether color combinations are accessible, based on the difference in color values. The author also references a blog post they wrote on this concept.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article provides a list of tools and alternatives for generating color schemes. The mentioned tools include:

- https://adevade.github.io/color-scheme-generator/
