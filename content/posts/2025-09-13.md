## 1. [An Open-Source Maintainer's Guide to Saying No](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45234593)

**Total comment counts : 0**

### Summary

 Maintaining OSS requires saying no to good ideas to preserve vision and coherence. Establish a mental model of the project, document why it exists, and let process align contributions with philosophy. LLM-generated code worsens signal-to-noise as unsolicited PRs bypass discussion. A good PR can come, but maintainers should push back unless it matches the project’s philosophy. Contrib modules can isolate non-core functionality, reducing long-term maintenance risk. The burden of proof rests with contributors, not the repo, and maintainers must manage ongoing responsibilities and response times.

## 2. [Magical systems thinking](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45233266)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 Modern systems grow from small, working beginnings, yet we overstate our control via ‘systems thinking.’ Governments have repeatedly struggled with complex systems (HealthCare.gov, Australian reforms, UK energy contracts). The best path back, the article argues, is to favor small, simple, working subsystems rather than grand designs. Early warnings from Jay Forrester’s World Dynamics warned of collapse under growth, but reality diverged: global GDP rose about fivefold since 1970, forests expanded, and deaths from air pollution halved. The limit of 19th-century chemists’ cautious approach remains: complex systems resist full mastery, and slow, incremental fixes win.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article critiques a hostile takedown of "systems thinking" for offering a weak definition, citing a single critic, and discrediting the discipline via one faulty prediction and negative views on government software. The responder argues this misreads systems thinking: models are tools to understand existing systems and anticipate reactions to interventions, not blueprints. It stresses testing simple designs in reality and warns that simplicity isn’t guaranteed to work, citing Gall’s Law. The piece suggests the author resists systems thinking as high modernism, but the terms may align in practice if discussed.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article notes that modeling human systems is hard because people react to models of their world and then change it. This reflexivity concept, central to social theory, has long existed and emerged roughly alongside systems thinking.

## 3. [Show HN: A store that generates products from anything you type in search](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45231378)

**Total comment counts : 119**

### Summary

 anycrap.shop promises instant visualization of unique, customer-specific product concepts. Describe your wild idea, and they’ll search across “parallel dimensions” to find or visualize it, delivering concepts directly to your device. The site markets a shopping experience driven by imagination and aims to let you be the first to discover new products. You can give a name and they’ll try to locate it. They even offer weekly emails about fictional products. The marketplace bills itself as “tomorrow’s products, available today”—not actually available.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece envisions turning a concept into a marketplace by pairing feasible, popular ideas with willing manufacturers, creating a real platform to monetize creations. The author calls it a hilarious project and notes personal success: they implemented two ideas—Mouthwash Ramen and Time Machine to the Present—and became hooked on the process.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author proclaims that this website represents the best use of AI, asserting it’s impossible to name a better application. They cite their “AI Idea Gauge” as justification and provide a link to a product page.

## 4. [RIP pthread_cancel](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45233713)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Curl released 8.16.0 with pthread_cancel to interrupt long getaddrinfo() calls in parallel transfers. That allowed overlap but caused cancellation points and memory leaks when libcurl cancelled worker threads. Investigation revealed glibc reads /etc/gai.conf during getaddrinfo; fopen/open are cancellation points, so cancelled threads could leak allocated results, restarting on next resolution. The team decided to drop pthread_cancel and accept occasional long getaddrinfo waits. Applications can use c-ares to avoid threading-based unblocking, though it can't do everything glibc does. DNS remains tricky. After #18532, memory leaks were confirmed, so the approach was dropped.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece argues that getaddrinfo lacks a standardized timeout, suggesting a 10-second limit would help. While Linux can configure timeouts via a config file, the DNS timeout should be controllable by the calling code, since some applications need fast failures while others can tolerate longer waits. There isn’t a universal timeout that fits all use cases.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Netscape started a separate thread (or possibly a subprocess) to perform DNS lookups because gethostbyname blocked. It’s striking that, about 30 years later, blocking DNS resolution remains a problem.

## 5. [486Tang – 486 on a credit-card-sized FPGA board](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45232565)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 486Tang v0.1 (GitHub) ports ao486 to the Sipeed Tang Console (GW5A) FPGA—likely the first non-Altera port of this core. Major changes: SDRAM as main memory (16-bit) with 32-bit CPU access via double-pumped memory; DDR3 for framebuffer; SD-card–based IDE due to lack of HPS-like interface; a boot loader preloads BIOS, VGA BIOS, CMOS, and IDE IDENTIFY data from the first 128 KB of SD. Debugging uses Verilator simulations with instrumentation; Bochs BIOS messages aid progress. The Tang runs near 25 MHz equivalent; bottlenecks are long combinational paths and reset fan-out; reset-tree mitigation helps.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Back in the 80486 era, DDR memory didn’t exist, and SDRAM wasn’t a natural fit for most 486 systems. SDRAM matched Pentium/K-6 standards (PC66), and DIMMs could outpace the 486 bus, which ran at half the CPU clock. Natural choices were FPM or EDO. A few late-486 motherboards did support SDRAM (post-1993), but this was rare near the end of the 486 era. Some boards even allowed a 386 to use FPM while a 486 socket remained, but EDO wasn’t mandatory. It’s just a personal project, after all.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article clarifies that DDR stands for Double-Data-Rate and notes a basic DDR implementation on SDRAM, concluding that it’s not a bad approach—just a clarification.

## 6. [Perceived Age](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45189963)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 Time speeds up as we age because our brain’s dopamine system and memory processes change, making novel experiences feel longer while repetition sharpens the sense that time is slipping away. Studies show people under 30 perceive 120 seconds as longer than people over 50. The perceived pace is a subcortical, neurochemical illusion: dopamine heightens time when new, while reduced novelty shortens it; memory and acetylcholine also shape it. A "reminiscence bump" from firsts anchors identity. By seeking novelty and learning new things, we can stretch our subjective sense of time despite aging.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece challenges the idea that life is half over by age 23 or 24. The narrator, nearing 24, argues time from 24 onward can feel longer, despite memories of a fast-moving early 30s. They credit ongoing novelty—changing jobs, traveling for work, learning new skills, meeting new people—with maintaining unpredictability and a sense that time doesn’t drag. By contrast, coworkers report little change over many years, and a college roommate’s routine remained basically the same for two decades until they reconnected. In short, time feels longer when life is routine and shorter with continual change.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Advise the 22-year-old author to be very cautious about making sweeping claims that purport to apply to an entire human life.

## 7. [Mago: A fast PHP toolchain written in Rust](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45232275)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Mago is a Rust-based toolchain for PHP that provides a fast linter, formatter, and static analyzer to help developers write better code. It aims for speed, reliability, and a great developer experience across PHP projects. Installation on macOS and Linux is mainly via a shell script, with other methods (Homebrew, Composer, Cargo) in the official Installation Guide. Getting started is in the docs. It is community-driven and welcomes contributions. Inspired by Rust and PHP ecosystem tools like PHP-CS-Fixer, Psalm, PHPStan, and PHP_CodeSniffer, Mago seeks a unified, faster alternative. It is dual-licensed.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that Mago, still in beta, is ahead of its documentation. A roadmap for a first release appeared recently. In testing on a medium-sized project, Mago produced tens of thousands of errors that phpstan and psalm didn’t report, likely because it doesn’t parse phpdoc. As a result, Mago is effectively meaningless for large PHP projects—the very targets—despite promising speed over other analysers. Without feature parity, the speed gain won’t persuade teams to switch, especially as PHP tooling evolves and fewer contributors master Rust compared with PHP.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Contrary to assumptions, Mago will not implement a PHP runtime. The PHP runtime is highly complex, and even large efforts (Facebook's HHVM, VK's KPHP) struggle to achieve parity with Zend Engine. For a small project, this would be infeasible and would fragment the community. Mago focuses on tooling, not runtimes. See the Mago FAQ for details.

## 8. [My First Impressions of Gleam](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45231852)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 An experienced programmer starts with Gleam, a statically-typed Elixir-like language, while aiming to build a universal AIM log parser. They see Gleam as suitable for parsing tasks and learn by example, despite being new to functional languages. They face tooling gaps: no standard CLI args module, glint feels overkill, but argv works. They explore building executables; Gleam’s build artifacts are BEAM bytecode, not directly runnable, so they rely on gleam run. They prototype a plaintext AIM log parser, write tests, and grapple with basics like splitting lines and using list.map instead of for loops.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains why functional languages are well-suited for parsing: using parser combinators, which build complex parsers by composing primitive ones. This approach keeps parsing logic clean and modular, especially for those interested in functional programming or parsing. It notes Gleam has two parser combinator packages—party and parser_gleam—with documentation available at their respective pages.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 An elegant, compact language that blends Haskell’s elegance with Erlang’s vibe. Not the standard choice, but very appealing. The core is deliberately small, so an experienced programmer can finish the quick tour and tackle simple Advent of Code problems in a day. This simplicity comes from the designer’s strict commitment to keeping the language minimal, even if it means missing features like pattern matching on function arguments.

## 9. [‘Someone must know this guy’: four-year wedding crasher mystery solved](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45232562)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Four years after her wedding in Prestwick, Michelle Wylie finally learned the identity of a lanky stranger who appeared at the ceremony. The man, Andrew Hillhouse, had arrived five minutes late for a different wedding two miles away in Ayr, followed others into the Carlton hotel, and sat through the entire ceremony before realizing his mistake. After a brief awkward exit, he joined the photographer for a group shot and later moved to the right wedding. Wylie and Hillhouse are now Facebook friends, and the mystery is solved, thanks to Dazza.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 While on holiday in Spain, the narrator wandered into a university building by mistake. Seeking shelter from rain, they entered a richly decorated hall and discovered a 1–2 hour presentation on Balearic Spanish being given in Catalan. The narrator barely spoke Castilian, so they understood nothing, but they stayed, clapped, and skipped the handshake/signing portion.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece questions whether “wedding” refers to the ceremony or the reception, then shares anecdotes about uninvited guests. In one memory, a best man distracts a crash­er with vodka and treats as a tall father-in-law approaches with bottle and shot glass, the intruder retreating toward the gate. In another, the narrator and partner encounter an after-party after a reception and are invited to join for leftovers. Overall, it portrays wedding receptions as social spaces where crashes occur and hospitality can be odd or welcoming.

## 10. [How Ruby executes JIT code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45189058)

**Total comment counts : 0**

### Summary

 Ruby’s JITs (ZJIT and YJIT) compile hot methods to native code while keeping the original bytecode for de-optimization. Each method’s ISEQ stores YARV bytecode, with jit_entry pointing to compiled code when available. If NULL, Ruby interprets bytecode. Compilation happens after warm-up, with ZJIT using a two-phase approach: profile threshold 25 and compile threshold 30. JITs rely on guards to optimize for common cases, and de-opt when assumptions fail. TracePoint activation slows performance because JITs replace instructions with trace variants and discard optimized code to preserve events. Not all methods are worth compiling; profiling guides decisions.
