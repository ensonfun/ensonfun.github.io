## 6. [Group actions and hashing unordered multisets (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40767207)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 The article discusses a result by Kevin Ventullo that uses group actions to study the structure of hash functions for unordered sets and multisets. This is interesting because it provides an example of the application of "pure" group theory to practical computer programming that is not cryptographic in nature. Hash functions for sets and multisets are used in programming to hash elements in such a way that the hash does not depend on the order of insertion. The article explores different strategies for creating such hash functions, highlighting their downsides and limitations. It then introduces the concept of accumulative and commutative hash functions, which impose an abelian group structure on the set of hashes. The structure of these hash functions can be characterized using the classification theorem of finite abelian groups. The article assumes basic familiarity with group theory and provides a brief review of group actions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses group hashes and explains that if a group is chosen where discrete log is difficult, such as prime order elliptic curves, multiset hashing can be achieved easily.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a non-associative variant of commutativity in the context of summing arbitrary sequences. The author points out that while 'h' itself is not commutative, summing arbitrary sequences is order independent as long as the same seed is used and the sum is performed from left to right. The author also mentions some concerns with the definition of 'phi', suggesting an alternative definition. Overall, the article explores the concept of commutativity in relation to sums and proposes different ways to express it.

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses the rarity and significance of Edgar Allan Poe's debut collection of poetry, Tamerlane and Other Poems. Only twelve copies of the book are known to have survived since its publication in 1827, and one of the last two copies in private hands is going up for auction. The book, published by the novice printer Calvin F.W. Thomas, features unevenly printed verses and a drab tan wrapper. Despite its humble appearance, Tamerlane marked the beginning of Poe's influential career. The article speculates on the relationship between Poe and Thomas, suggesting that they may have been acquainted through their families or through a business listing. Tamerlane, although poorly received and with low sales, gained significance due to Poe's later works such as his detective stories, gothic tales, and macabre poems. The book is considered a holy grail of book collecting and generates excitement among rare book enthusiasts whenever a first edition comes up for auction. The article also mentions the scarcity of copies, with one copy being stolen in 1973, potentially reducing the known copies to eleven.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the theft of a copy of a book written by Edgar Allan Poe from the University of Virginia in 1973. If the stolen copy is not recovered, there will only be eleven known copies left. A Poe expert speculates that the book may have been destroyed to hide evidence. However, the author suggests that it is more likely that the thieves were fans of Poe who wanted the book for themselves or stole it for someone who was a fan, rather than destroying such a rare item.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In Brazil, using drugs is considered a misdemeanor, not a crime. However, the 2006 drugs law did not specify the quantity of drugs that would be considered a crime, leading to an increase in arrests. The recent decision by the Supreme Court is valid because of a legal problem with how lower courts are handling drug cases. The 2006 law also does not mention which drugs are classified as such, leaving that task to the Brazilian FDA (Anvisa). This means that with the right appointments, Anvisa could classify drugs like marijuana as non-dangerous, making them legal to sell. Furthermore, an incident in 2000 resulted in accidental legalization of a drug called Chloroethane for a few weeks, leading to the release of a person from prison.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 In 1982, the author's friend was charged with cultivation of 200 female cannabis plants in Australia. His lawyer presented evidence to support the argument that the plants were for personal use, including witnesses testifying that the friend consumed a large amount of marijuana and a petition signed by almost half of his village attesting to his personal use. The friend was ultimately fined for personal use. The author highlights the potential for bias and unfairness when judges exercise discretion in their rulings.
