## 6. [What's New in POSIX 2024](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41978197)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 In the 1950s, computer interoperability was minimal, with operating systems tied to specific hardware and most communication occurring over the telephone, dominated by the Bell System. This led to an antitrust lawsuit against the Bell System, resulting in a 1956 consent decree that broke it up and required it to license patents royalty-free. In this context, Bell developed Unix, focusing on software after it could no longer compete in certain markets. Unix initially ran on the PDP-7 and evolved to the PDP-11, gaining traction in the internal environment.

As Unix grew popular, Bell shipped it at manufacturing cost, and it became widely adopted. However, after another antitrust suit, AT&T was freed from earlier restrictions, subsequently commercializing Unix, which prompted the emergence of various Unix versions and standardization efforts, including POSIX.

POSIX, which standardizes Unix-like operating systems, has sections such as XBD (Base Definitions), XSH (System Interfaces), and XCU (Shell Command Language). The article focuses on the utilities part of XCU, highlighting a common mistake in shell scripting regarding the treatment of filenames containing newline characters, emphasizing the need to handle files more robustly—often through alternative methods like using wildcards or the `find` command. The upcoming POSIX 2024 release is noted as a significant development in the ongoing evolution of these standards.

- Various enhancements have been made to the `printf`, `sed`, and `test` commands.

## 7. [The electrostatic world of insects](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41978478)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article explores the intriguing possibility that honeybees and other small creatures can sense static electricity as they navigate their environments. This electrostatic awareness may allow them to detect flowers and influence various ecological interactions, akin to how aquatic animals perceive electric fields in water. Research initiated by Daniel Robert in 2013 demonstrated that bees can detect electric fields, leading to further studies on other insects like spiders and ticks that also react to static electricity.

This emerging field, called aerial electroreception, suggests that static electricity has significant ecological impacts, such as aiding parasites in finding hosts and attracting pollen to pollinators. The study of these interactions could reveal new insights into how small animals find food, migrate, and interact within ecosystems. Notably, the concept was further examined by Víctor Ortega-Jiménez, whose observations led to findings that spider webs might actively attract charged insects, enhancing their hunting efficiency. The article emphasizes the potential of this research to reshape our understanding of animal behavior and ecological dynamics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how size affects the experience of electrostatics in animals. Large animals, like humans, largely ignore static electricity due to their size, existing mainly in a world of gravity and fluid dynamics. In contrast, smaller creatures, such as insects, are more influenced by electrostatic forces, since gravity is less significant for them. For example, butterflies generate a positive charge when they flap their wings, attracting pollen to them as they land on flowers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explores the intriguing concept of passive pollen dispersal through static electricity on pollinators, which is both logical and surprising. For a better reading experience, particularly on mobile devices, a link to the article is provided.

## 8. [Building a better and scalable system for data migrations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41935730)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses a new Rust web framework called rwf and its approach to database migrations. The author critiques rwf for generating two SQL files for migrations—forward and backward—arguing that this method is inadequate for larger projects as it doesn't scale effectively. 

The article establishes several terms related to databases and migrations to provide clarity, focusing specifically on relational databases like PostgreSQL and SQLite. The author explains what constitutes a "large" database and outlines the key components of a migration process.

Using GitLab as a real-world example, the author highlights the challenges faced as the database size grew from 200-300 GiB to 1-2 TiB, making traditional migration methods impractical for significant changes. GitLab's use of Ruby on Rails for migrations required separate solutions to manage larger tables and external data, revealing issues with Rails’ migration framework. 

The discussion points to a systemic problem with existing migration systems, which assume that migrations are timeless and always applicable, a notion that fails with more complex migrations. The author suggests that understanding these challenges is essential for developing better migration frameworks in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the perspective that database migrations should be performed using functions in programming languages, rather than relying solely on SQL snippets. The author argues against this view, advocating that SQL is a clear and universal declarative language. They emphasize that migrations should be straightforward, and since SQL is declarative, it reduces the need for tests; the intended outcome of the migration is clearly defined. The author also prioritizes declarative approaches in infrastructure management and expresses a desire not to conduct tests on tools like Terraform or DDL, suggesting that the clarity of declarative statements minimizes uncertainty and the potential for errors.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of "tunability" in database systems, in addition to correctness. While ensuring correctness is vital, it may not be sufficient for large systems, as substantial database operations, like big table rewrites, can significantly affect performance and may render the database nearly unusable. The author advocates for better control over the load imposed by Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations, highlighting the lack of options for throttling or pausing such operations in standard SQL. They mention existing solutions in systems like TiDB, pt-osc, and gh-ost, which allow for pausing or dynamically throttling migrations. However, they express concern that popular tools for PostgreSQL currently lack effective management capabilities for this issue.

## 9. [How to get the whole planet to send abuse complaints to your best friends](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41982698)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article recounts a personal experience from the author, who received a concerning email indicating that one of their servers was sending unauthorized SSH connections to the internet, raising suspicions of a malware compromise.
