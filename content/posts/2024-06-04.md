## 2. [If English was written like Chinese (1999)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40565060)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article discusses two approaches to address the complexities of the English spelling system. The first approach suggests using Chinese characters, known as hanzi, directly. This would involve creating new representations for English words based on the corresponding Chinese syllables. However, this approach would face challenges with pronunciation and spelling for proper names. The second approach suggests creating a new system called yingzi, or English characters. This system would work similarly to hanzi, with one yingzi representing a syllable with a specific meaning. Syllables that rhyme would have variations on a theme, represented by yingzi. The article also mentions the use of pictograms and ideograms to represent English morphemes. The yingzi would serve as the basis for an open-ended set of characters that represent rhyming syllables. Radicals would be used to distinguish different characters within a phonetic group. Overall, the article explores different methods to simplify the English spelling system by drawing inspiration from Chinese characters.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article describes the reasons why Chinese characters continue to be used in the Chinese language. It explains that tradition and practicality are the main factors behind the use of logographic writing. The article highlights that Chinese is not one unified language, but rather consists of mutually unintelligible dialects. If a phonetic writing system were to be used, it would be difficult to understand materials written in different dialects. However, with a logographic approach, characters can be understood regardless of pronunciation. The article also mentions that Japanese benefits from the use of Chinese characters, as they make sentences shorter, less ambiguous, and easier to understand.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the misconceptions about the Chinese language and its characters. The author mentions that while Chinese characters may appear to make more sense in terms of their meaning, it becomes difficult to determine the pronunciation of a new word just by looking at the characters. The article also points out that English faces similar challenges in this aspect. On the other hand, Spanish is considered to be a language where the pronunciation of words is usually consistent with their written form.

## 10. [âYou Are My Friendâ: Early Androids and Artificial Speech](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40548381)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 The article explores the history of androids that were created to simulate human speech in the eighteenth century. It starts with the origin of the term "android" and how it was coined by Gabriel NaudÃ©, a French physician and librarian, to describe talking automaton heads. The article also mentions the story of Albertus Magnus, a thirteenth-century philosopher who supposedly built an artificial man made of bronze. However, NaudÃ© rejected the idea of talking automaton heads due to their lack of necessary parts and instruments for speech. Despite this, NaudÃ© gave the term "android" its new meaning and it became widely used in dictionaries and encyclopedias. The article then introduces the first actual android, a working human-shaped machine that could play a flute, which was displayed in 1738 at the Saint-Germain fair in Paris.
