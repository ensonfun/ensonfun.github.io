## 2. [The race to replace Redis](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39858144)

**Total comment counts : 45**

### Summary

 Redis Ltd. has announced that the Redis "in-memory data store" project will now be released under non-free, source-available licenses starting with Redis 7.4. This move has led to the emergence of several Redis alternatives, including KeyDB and the Linux Foundation's Valkey project. Redis has a complex history, starting as a project by Salvatore Sanfilippo to create a different kind of database. It gained popularity as part of the NoSQL movement and was used by high-profile companies like Twitter and Pinterest. Redis Labs, previously known as Garantia Data, started offering Redis services and adopted a new license for its add-on modules in 2018. The company settled on a dual-license scheme of Server Side Public License (SSPL) and Redis Source Available License (RSAL) and dropped "Labs" from its name in mid-2021. Now, all future versions of Redis will be released under source-available licenses.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that Redis will continue to provide a free "community edition" of their software that will be supported and improved. This means developers don't have to worry about replacing Redis in their SAAS apps and web-based software. The article also mentions that the main purpose of this move is to prevent AWS from offering Redis-as-a-service without compensating the Redis developers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that license compatibility is often overlooked. If projects currently use the BSD license for Redis, they would be unable to include the SSPL license for Redis without either changing their own license or not including it at all if other components are incompatible with SSPL. However, the author sees this as good news because it ensures that there will likely be a well-maintained open-source alternative to Redis.

## 5. [Facebook let Netflix see user DMs, quit streaming to keep Netflix happy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39858850)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 Meta, Facebook's parent company, has received criticism for discontinuing its original shows on Facebook Watch. Recently unsealed court documents in an antitrust suit against Meta claim that the decision was made to appease Netflix, one of its biggest ad customers. The lawsuit alleges that Netflix and Facebook had a strong business relationship, with Facebook providing Netflix access to users' private messages. Meta has not responded to the allegations, but it previously stated that it rolled out end-to-end encryption for personal chats and calls. The case is still ongoing.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the fact that the context is omitted to make the situation appear worse than it actually is. It clarifies that Facebook did not randomly give Netflix access to people's messages. Instead, users would have to voluntarily log into the Netflix app with their Facebook account to grant Netflix access to the chat functionality. This was intended to send movie recommendations to their Facebook friends within the Netflix app. The summary emphasizes that the assistant providing the summary works at Facebook but not in the messaging department or anything related to the article.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the contradiction between Facebook's claim of not using private messages for ad targeting and the report that Facebook allowed Netflix and Spotify to read users' private messages. Facebook introduced end-to-end encryption for personal chats and calls on Messenger and Facebook. However, it is unclear how Facebook is able to use these messages if they are encrypted and inaccessible. The exact activities Facebook is undertaking with private messages are confidential, and speculations can be made but not verified. Meta, formerly known as Facebook, is considered a third party and there seems to be an attempt to redefine terms like "end-to-end" and "third party".

## 6. [OpenVoice: Versatile instant voice cloning](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39861578)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 OpenVoice is a versatile instant voice cloning approach that can replicate someone's voice with just a short audio clip and generate speech in multiple languages. It allows for granular control over voice styles like emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation, while also replicating the tone color of the reference speaker. OpenVoice is computationally efficient and achieves zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning for languages not included in the training set. It costs significantly less than other available APIs with comparable performance. The technical report and source code can be found at the provided links.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes the experience of running a Gradio demo locally. The demo appears to be faster than XTTS2 and uses around 1.5GB of VRAM. The Gradio demo is limited to 200 characters but runs at around 8x realtime. The author patched the demo for longer text and found that one minute of speech took about 4 seconds to render. The voice clarity is better than XTTS2, but the speech can sound somewhat robotic compared to it. The cloning consistency of the Gradio demo is better than XTTS2, with fewer pitch shifts or plosives in the speech.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author questions the non-questionable uses of a specific technology, as all the applications they can think of seem problematic, including pornography, identity theft, impersonation, replacing voice actors, stealing their likeness, and using bots for customer support without disclosure. The author mentions the possibility of providing realistic voices for individuals who have lost their own, but doubts this would justify the investment.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an issue with using a tool called "revng" to analyze an ELF file. The user tries to use the tool on a file called "maytag.ko" but encounters an error message indicating that only ELF executables and ELF dynamic libraries are supported. The user then realizes that the issue is likely due to the fact that the file is a kernel module, rather than a simple executable.

## 8. [Math writing is dull when it neglects the human dimension](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39859801)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 The article discusses the importance of making math writing interesting and engaging for readers. It suggests that math papers can benefit from techniques used in storytelling, such as quickly grabbing the reader's attention and setting the scene. The article emphasizes the need for clear and enticing introductions, as this is usually the part of the paper that readers are most likely to read. It also suggests simplifying technical terminology to make the paper more accessible.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In this article, the author discusses their thoughts on self-promotion in mathematics. While they believe that excessive hype should not be tolerated, they feel that many mathematicians do not provide enough detail or motivation in their arguments. The author also expresses frustration with mathematical exposition, particularly with the omission of important details and the use of phrases like "obviously" and "it is easy to see." They argue that these phrases indicate the presence of information that needs to be filled in, causing confusion for readers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article agrees and feels disappointed when they come across old mathematical papers that are difficult to understand and lack practical applications. They have discussed this issue with other mathematicians who believe that conciseness and elegance are the same thing, and those who are supposed to read these papers don't need explanations. The author also suspects that some professors may criticize them if they include more explanatory material, but acknowledges that this is an unspoken concern.

## 9. [The Great Migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39860769)

**Total comment counts : 38**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Infisical underwent a database migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. The decision to migrate was driven by the need for a more universal database that could cater to the growing demand for self-hosting Infisical. MongoDB was found to have limitations, including lack of support for transactions and issues with schema-less database design. PostgreSQL was chosen as the new database due to its vibrant community, extensive documentation, and availability of managed services from cloud providers. The article also mentions the selection of Knex.js as the query builder for interacting with the PostgreSQL database. The migration process involved rewriting data structures and queries.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author has experience using both Postgres and MongoDB at large scales. They state that they like both databases and believe that, in terms of data modeling, both can build similar applications with the same schema. However, they express frustration with the lack of out-of-the-box support for high availability (HA) and horizontal scaling in Postgres. They argue that Postgres installations often require a combination of extensions, third-party software, and custom scripts to fill this gap, which can be problematic due to the issues with third-party software and the pain of upgrading. The author believes that there is little interest in improving these features in the Postgres core because companies that contribute to Postgres make money selling HA and sharding solutions. They compare Postgres unfavorably to MySQL, which they believe is significantly better in terms of HA and scaling. Despite their frustrations, the author still believes Postgres is suitable for single node setups where HA and scaling are not a concern.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL and provides more technical details, including examples and graphs. The focus is less on the business aspects of the migration.
