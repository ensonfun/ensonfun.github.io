## 2. [Elixir/Erlang Hot Swapping Code (2016)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42404411)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses the advantage of runtime environments like Erlang and Elixir, which allow for dynamic loading and unloading of code without stopping the system. This capability, often referred to as "hot-swapping," enables:

1. **Continuous Deployment**: Systems can be upgraded or updated in real-time without service interruption, which is particularly beneficial for maintaining uptime and service continuity.

2. **Mechanism of Hot-Swapping**: The process involves suspending processes, loading new code into memory, and then resuming the processes with the new code. Functions like `:sys.suspend/1`, `:sys.resume/1`, `:code.load_file/1`, and `:sys.change_code/4` in Erlang/Elixir are highlighted for their roles in this process.

3. **Practical Example**: An example is provided where a simple key-value store module (`KV`) is modified to include logging. The steps to achieve this include modifying the module, compiling it, and then using the runtime's functions to apply the changes live.

4. **Development vs. Production**: While functions like `r/1` and `c/1` in `iex` are convenient for development to reload or compile modules, they are not suitable for production. Instead, the article introduces **Relups** (Release Upgrade Scripts) for managing upgrades in production environments.

5. **Erlang/OTP Applications and Releases**: The article also touches on Erlang's concept of applications and releases, explaining that an Erlang application is defined by an `.app` file which contains metadata and dependencies. A release includes the entire system setup, including the Erlang VM and all necessary applications, facilitating a structured approach to deployment and upgrades.

In summary, the article outlines how Erlang and Elixir leverage runtime capabilities for seamless updates, the practical application of these features, and introduces more sophisticated tools for managing production environments.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 5. [Mathematicians uncover a new way to count prime numbers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42405733)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses a significant advancement in number theory, focusing on prime numbers. Mathematicians Ben Green and Mehtaab Sawhney have developed a new proof that addresses the distribution of a specific type of prime number, which has historically been very challenging to study. Their work not only enhances understanding of where primes are located but also demonstrates the unexpected utility of mathematical tools from different areas, hinting at their broader applicability. This proof was highlighted for its surprising approach and potential impact, showing there are infinitely many primes of a form previously considered too restrictive to study effectively. The research continues a long tradition of exploring prime numbers, which are fundamental in mathematics yet notoriously difficult to predict or categorize due to their seemingly random distribution.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the complexity of finding prime numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two squares. Here are the key points:

- **Infinite Primes from Sum of Squares**: It's known that there are infinitely many primes that can be expressed in the form \(a^2 + b^2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are whole numbers.

- **Odd and Even Considerations**: The author questions whether requiring one of the numbers to be odd makes the problem significantly harder. By examining the properties of numbers modulo 2, they conclude that for a prime number \(p\) greater than 2 (which must be odd), one of \(a\) or \(b\) must indeed be odd, as \(a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}\) implies \(a + b \equiv 1 \pmod{2}\).

- **Misinterpretation or Clarification**: The article mentions a proof by Euler about the existence of such primes, but then introduces a conjecture by Friedlander and Iwaniec about primes of the form \(p^2 + 4q^2\). The author suggests there might be confusion or sloppy writing in the article, implying that the real achievement might relate to a more specific condition, like one of \(p\) or \(q\) being a perfect square itself.

- **Summary**: The discussion revolves around the mathematical conditions for primes as sums of squares, with an emphasis on the parity (odd or even nature) of the components and potential miscommunication regarding the significance of recent mathematical proofs or conjectures.

 The article discussed was criticized for its writing style, which the reader felt echoed a scenario where a change (in this case, a UI update) was reverted because it was too effective, leading to users spending less time on the website.

## 6. [Fixing the Loading in Myst IV: Revelation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42372565)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article discusses Anthony Kleine's project to address the notorious loading issue in "Myst IV: Revelation," a game from the Myst series known for its long loading times when navigating through its world. Here's a summary:

- **Background**: Anthony, a fan of the Myst series, was particularly bothered by the loading times in Myst IV, which were slow even when the game was new, due to its reliance on reading assets from a DVD. This problem persisted even when the game was re-released on platforms like Steam, where it could be installed on faster SSDs.

- **Motivation**: With the re-release of "Riven" by Cyan, Anthony anticipated renewed interest in Myst games and decided to tackle the loading problem himself after waiting for someone else to fix it.

- **Approach**: Inspired by a blog about fixing loading times in GTA IV, Anthony used a tool called Luke Stackwalker to profile the game's performance. Initial profiling during idle gameplay showed that most CPU time was spent on graphics rendering synchronization. However, during loading, significant time was consumed by functions related to image loading from LEADTOOLS, a middleware used by the game.

- **Solution**: Anthony developed a tool named "Myst IV: Revolution" aimed at reducing these loading times. He detailed his process, which involved analyzing and understanding the bottlenecks caused by image loading functions, suggesting that his solution might involve optimizing these calls or the way images are handled during loading.

- **Outcome**: The article ends with Anthony providing a link to his GitHub repository where others can download his tool to fix the loading issues in Myst IV, indicating a successful, albeit long, endeavor to improve the game's performance.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the performance issues of a game, focusing on its loading times:

1. **Loading Time Issue**: The game takes about two seconds to load each time, which is unexpected given modern hardware capabilities like high RAM and SSD bandwidth. This is surprising because the game's total asset size is limited due to its initial release on two DVDs, suggesting a maximum of a few dozen GB.

2. **Technical Bottleneck**: The game's slow performance is attributed to inefficient memory copying (`memcpy`). The developers are copying data row by row for each image, and since the images are stored in JPEG format, this involves copying large amounts of uncompressed pixel data, which significantly slows down the process.

3. **Hardware Discrepancy**: Despite being run on modern hardware, the game's performance does not improve, suggesting there might be a fixed amount of per-frame work hardcoded into the game. This could mean that the system for loading DirectDraw Surface files (DDS) might be incorrectly accounting for or handling the memory operations.

4. **File Size Observation**: A screenshot mentioned in the article shows that the largest file, `data.m4b`, is only 1.4GB, with other files being even smaller, further questioning why such a small amount of data takes so long to load.

Overall, the article raises concerns about why a game with relatively modest data requirements performs so poorly on hardware that should theoretically handle it with ease, pointing towards software inefficiencies rather than hardware limitations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a common error in image processing where alpha premultiplication is incorrectly applied to images in gamma-compressed color spaces like sRGB. The key points are:

- **Incorrect Application**: The author of a referenced paper mistakenly applies alpha premultiplication to an image in gamma-compressed space, which should instead be done in linear color space.

- **Consequences**: This mistake leads to visual artifacts such as halos around color edges because:
  - Alpha values are typically stored linearly.
  - Colors in common formats are gamma compressed.
  - Premultiplying alpha in a gamma space and then linearizing causes misapplication of alpha, leading to incorrect blending (multiplying instead of adding colors), resulting in black halos around edges.

- **Correct Approach**: The article implies that for correct image processing, one should first linearize the gamma-compressed image, apply alpha premultiplication in this linear space, and then proceed with further processing or blending.

## 9. [The age of average (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42405999)

**Total comment counts : 58**

### Summary

 The article discusses an art project by Russian artists Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid in the early 1990s, where they surveyed people across different countries to understand their artistic preferences, resulting in a series called "People’s Choice." Despite the diverse backgrounds of respondents, the paintings ended up looking very similar, primarily featuring blue landscapes with figures and animals, highlighting a universal taste in art that undermines the notion of individuality. This project inadvertently pointed to a broader cultural phenomenon of conformity in aesthetics, which the article explores further through contemporary examples:

1. **AirBnB Design Aesthetic**: The article describes how interior design trends, particularly through platforms like AirBnB, have converged into what's known as "International Airbnb Style" or "AirSpace." This style features elements like white walls, raw wood, and industrial-chic decor, creating a generic, comforting, yet unoriginal look that's prevalent worldwide.

2. **Cultural Uniformity**: The spread of this uniform aesthetic isn't limited to homes but extends to commercial spaces, suggesting a broader cultural shift towards sameness in creative expressions across film, fashion, architecture, and advertising. This has led to what the author describes as the "age of average," where distinctiveness is diminishing.

The narrative uses these examples to argue that despite the desire for uniqueness, there's a strong pull towards conventional and cliché designs, reflecting a deeper human tendency towards conformity rather than individuality. This observation is supported by the artists' initial findings and the subsequent examples of how global trends in design and culture are homogenizing.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article critiques the snobbery in architectural commentary, particularly the disdain for uniform, affordable mid-rise apartment buildings. The author points out that while some critics lament the lack of architectural uniqueness in these developments, cities like Austin have seen a reduction in rent thanks to such construction, benefiting many residents. The critique extends to wealthy tourists who seek variety in architecture during their travels but find sameness instead, even in picturesque regions like southern France, Croatia, and Greece, where traditional architecture also follows similar patterns due to practical reasons like available resources and cost. The author suggests that throughout history, the primary concern of people has been affordable and practical housing rather than architectural distinctiveness, especially in an era where materials are not necessarily sourced locally due to global trade.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's observations on the homogenization of food culture in various regions, particularly noting how traditional regional recipes and local eateries are being replaced by more generic, international-style dishes designed to appeal to tourists and social media users. Examples include the transformation of pintxos in Bilbao, Spain, into elaborate dishes focused on appearance rather than authenticity, and the decline of traditional Mallorcan restaurants in favor of generic "Spanish" cuisine. The author expresses concern that this trend, observed globally including in Stockholm, might be irreversible.
