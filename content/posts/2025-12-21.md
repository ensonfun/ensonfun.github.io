## 1. [Logging Sucks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46346796)

**Total comment counts : 55**

### Summary

 Logs are broken for distributed systems; traditional logs lack context and are hard to correlate across services. Adding OpenTelemetry doesn’t fix them. Emphasize structured logging with high cardinality and high dimensionality, producing wide (canonical) log lines: one per request per service, containing all relevant context. Treat logs as structured business events rather than a debugging diary. Use a wide event per service hop, enabling SQL-like querying of production data rather than grep searches. OpenTelemetry is a delivery mechanism, not a solution; you must instrument to include business context (user, metrics, flags). Build the event across the request and emit once.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion weighs the value and trade-offs of using wide events and structured, top-level logging to improve observability in distributed systems.
- Concern: Relying on end-of-request wide events can obscure mid-request failures, blow up log volume, and require cultural and tooling changes that may not justify the complexity.
- Perspectives: Some users praise wide events and structured logs for better correlation and context across services, while others warn they add unnecessary complexity, hurt readability, and may not replace traditional tracing and per-step logging.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 4. [The gift card accountability sink](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46348455)

**Total comment counts : 0**

### Summary

 The piece challenges the blanket claim that accepting gift cards is always a scam. Gift cards are a legitimate payments rail used by many firms, including to transact with people lacking payment methods, and an ecosystem of program managers exists to help retailers handle balances, escheatment, and regulatory compliance. However, gift cards are heavily exploited in scams: the FBI IC3 logged $16.6B in 2024 reports, with fraudsters inducing vulnerable victims to buy cards and share numbers and PINs, then launder the value into cash, crypto, or stolen goods. U.S. protections exist, but card-based fraud victims fare poorly; nuances matter.

## 5. [Show HN: WalletWallet – create Apple passes from anything](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46345745)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 An entirely free, browser-based utility that converts physical barcodes into Apple Wallet passes. Users place the QR code in a framing guide, and the tool generates a standard .pkpass file. Developed by Alen and Claude (predominantly Claude). Apple Wallet is a trademark of Apple Inc.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A browser-based tool to generate and manage wallet passes and barcodes (PKPass) is being discussed, with ideas for open-source signing and cross-platform use.
- Concern: The primary worry is privacy and security since pass data would be sent to a server, coupled with PKPass signing constraints that push toward server-side or developer-account signing.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from privacy‑minded, client‑side/browser‑only approaches to hosted solutions for convenience, with debates over AI vs manual barcode entry, barcode format support, and cross‑wallet compatibility.
- Overall sentiment: Cautiously optimistic

## 6. [Mullvad VPN: "This is a Chat Control 3.0 attempt."](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46347080)

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on privacy rights, data retention, and internet freedom in the EU, weighing the need to curb foreign influence against the risk of overreach and repeated, unenforced laws. 
- Concern: A primary worry is that new data-retention or surveillance laws will enable broad state control, be ineffective or inconsistently enforced, and potentially erode free speech or enable a social-credit-like regime. 
- Perspectives: Views range from staunch defense of net neutrality and privacy and distrust of overbearing regulation to criticisms of EU leadership, skepticism of VPNs as security, and calls for political solutions over techno-fixes. 
- Overall sentiment: Mixed, with cautious skepticism about regulation and a defense of internet freedom.

## 7. [I Program on the Subway](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46294694)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 Moving to NYC intensified my time crunch: a 30-minute subway commute wastes an hour daily. I use that time to program, despite lacking monitors, internet, or a reliable setup. I value the focus of a distraction-free environment; free WiFi lets me download packages or check docs briefly. My low-level embedded projects often can't be fully tested, so I chase fast edit/compile/run cycles and sometimes sketch diagrams on paper. I carry a cheap ThinkPad and a notebook; theft risk is low. Public coding sparks conversations and friendships. Seat shortages are my main obstacle; I’m prototyping a stand-up split keyboard with display.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: People discuss doing productive work on commutes—coding, reading, and learning—driven by changes in devices, connectivity, and culture over time.
- Concern: Safety and security risks on transit when using devices, including theft or phone jacking, and potential privacy or bystander disruption issues.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic commuters who code or study on the move with compact gear to skeptics who find mobile connectivity, social norms, or safety barriers prohibitive, with many sharing diverse setups.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [More on whether useful quantum computing is "imminent"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46348318)

**Total comment counts : 0**

### Summary

 Scott Aaronson argues that scalable quantum computing may be nearer than a decade ago suggested, based on recent experimental milestones. After attending Q2B and delivering a keynote on why QC works, his optimism grew as previous doubts faded. He highlights favorable takes from peers (Babbush, Preskill) and Quantinuum’s successes, and discusses a podcast on fault-tolerant QC. He warns, analogously to the Frisch–Peierls memo, that detailed estimates of when cryptography will break may be suppressed for security reasons, making urgent migration to post-quantum cryptosystems essential. The post also notes uncertain online access to Q2B talks and other blog disclosures.

## 9. [E.W.Dijkstra Archive](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46345523)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 Edsger Dijkstra’s career blended academia and industry, with a deep commitment to teaching and advancing computing science. Over four decades he produced EWDs—numbered technical notes, trip reports, and reflections—that circulated widely among peers. Today, UT Austin’s Center for American History holds the originals, while a growing web site hosts over a thousand PDFs. The archive provides a BibTeX index and ad-hoc title indexes, plus a year map for EWDs; some translations exist and volunteers help with transcription and proofreading. Copyrights mostly belong to his heirs; recordings and interviews are also available.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion nostalgically highlights Dijkstra's EWD notes and their informal, handwritten circulation, contrasting that historical practice with contemporary concerns about AI-generated code.
- Concern: There is worry that unedited manuscripts can propagate misunderstandings, and that modern AI systems may produce hallucinated, unreliable code.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from romantic admiration of the informal, collaborative culture behind the EWDs to concerns about rigor and accuracy, with literary and technical analogies to Salieri/Mozart and tape-based I/O.
- Overall sentiment: Nostalgic with cautious concern

## 10. [I can't upgrade to Windows 11, now leave me alone](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46347108)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 Ibrahim Diallo, a Los Angeles software developer, argues Windows 11’s TPM 2.0 hardware requirement excludes his 10-year-old laptop while nagging him with reminders. He contends Microsoft can run arbitrary code on his PC, and that the “dismiss” options are effectively non-existent, nudging users toward buying new hardware. Clicking “learn more” leads to store ads, implying consent to ads and tracking. He calls the design hostile and an “illusion of choice,” notes the notification tool is called Reusable UX Interaction Manager or Campaign Manager, and jokes about enforcing his own server-logging terms.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on widespread dissatisfaction with Windows/Microsoft (ads, cloud integration, forced updates) amid rising hardware costs and a growing shift toward Linux and other OS options.
- Concern: The main worry is that vendor tactics and price pressures will erode user autonomy and push users to migrate away, fragmenting the ecosystem.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from strong advocacy for switching to Linux/other OSes to continuing with Windows with tweaks or LTSC, with some saying Windows is no longer viable for many tasks while others note practical constraints.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed, leaning critical
