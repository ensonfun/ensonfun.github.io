## 9. [Reports of the death of dental cavities are greatly exaggerated](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41573550)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses the prevalence of dental cavities, or dental caries, in children, recognizing it as a chronic disease more common than asthma. While commonly linked to sugar consumption and the bacterium Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), which contributes to tooth decay by producing acid in the presence of sugars, researchers have explored potential solutions like a product named Lumina. Lumina claims to replace harmful bacteria in the mouth with a harmless strain, offering a lifetime of protection from cavities after a single application. 

The article recounts the historical understanding of cavities, highlighting a discovery by Dr. Jeffrey Hillman that identified a less harmful mutation of S. mutans, leading to the idea of "replacement therapy." This therapy aims to colonize the mouth with a benign strain that meets strict criteria for safety and effectiveness, ultimately leading to the development of strain BCS3-L1, which doesn't produce harmful acid and can successfully replace the harmful bacteria. Testing in rats and humans shows promise, suggesting a potential shift in preventing cavities without invasive treatments.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a product called Lumina, which cannot guarantee complete prevention of future cavities (caries). However, it emphasizes that guarantees are not necessary; what matters is the significant reduction in the occurrence of caries. For example, if Lumina reduces cavities by 50%, that would represent substantial progress compared to a hypothetical drug that prevents 100% of cavities. The author believes that the potential effectiveness of Lumina may not be fully appreciated in the discourse surrounding it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how FDA restrictions on clinical trials have hindered the ability to gather data on a specific bacteria before it became available as a supplement. It suggests that there is significant demand for this product, and that researchers like Hillman et al could have organized a trial if not for the stringent testing regulations. It raises the question of why informed consent is not enough for participation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
