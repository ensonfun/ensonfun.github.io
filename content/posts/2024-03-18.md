## 3. [Cranelift code generation comes to Rust](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39742692)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 Cranelift is a code-generation backend for WebAssembly being developed as part of the Wasmtime runtime. It aims to generate code faster by prioritizing key optimizations. The Rust project made Cranelift available as optional in its nightly toolchain, allowing users to use it as the code-generation backend for debug builds. Cranelift has a focus on fast code generation and can be used in non-WebAssembly projects. It uses a custom intermediate representation called CLIF and directly emits machine code. Despite its focus on speed, Cranelift still optimizes the code it generates using an optimization pipeline based on equality graphs. The order of optimizations does not affect the result due to the use of equality saturation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that different backends and optimization techniques can be used for different crates in Rust programming. It recommends using optimized LLVM builds for dependencies and debug LLVM or Cranelift for personal code. The article also provides a link for further information.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the trade-off between the speed of optimization and the quality of optimization in compiler tools. The author highlights the advantages of copy-and-patch compilation as the fastest approach, although it has limited room for optimization. They also introduce Cranelift, which uses e-graphs to enable more optimizations than copy-and-patch. The article mentions that the most optimized output can be achieved with traditional compiler toolchains like LLVM or GCC. However, newer compiler techniques offer a promising alternative for users who prioritize faster output.

### Summary

 Claire Voisin, a senior researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research, has become a prominent figure in the field of algebraic geometry. Despite her initial interest in painting, poetry, and philosophy, Voisin eventually fell in love with mathematics during her university years. She sees mathematics as both an art form and a way to push the boundaries of language. Voisin emphasizes the importance of language in mathematics for understanding old concepts and creating new ones. She describes the experience of engaging in mathematics as an extraordinary one, where the rest of the world disappears and all of one's brain is focused on studying a problem. Although she initially struggled to take mathematics seriously, Voisin eventually recognized its depth and began making her own discoveries. She has received numerous awards for her work, including the Crafoord Prize in Mathematics, becoming the first woman to win the award. Despite her commitment to mathematics, Voisin has recently found time to pursue her interests in painting and sculpture.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses how low property taxes and the absence of land value taxes provide significant benefits to low-value businesses, specifically car washes. It emphasizes that the real estate aspect of car washes is the most profitable, enabling them to obtain 3-4 times leverage with low-interest loans. The author believes that in the past, there was a high information asymmetry between local residents and large investors in real estate, favoring small businesses and individuals. However, with the internet and increased observability, this advantage has diminished. The article suggests that the current policies allow for easy arbitrage between low-cost federal/private equity cash and "dumb" business categories like car washes and self-storage. The author also mentions their personal choice to avoid car washes, instead relying on rain and occasional manual cleaning for a depreciating asset.

### Summary

 Tarsus Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral pill to protect humans from Lyme disease by killing ticks. The pill, which contains the drug lotilaner, showed promising results in a small trial, with 24 hours after taking the drug being enough to kill ticks, and the effects lasting up to 30 days. Lyme disease is a significant problem in the United States, with around 476,000 people diagnosed and treated for it each year. Currently, prevention methods include using insect repellents and wearing protective clothing, but there is no vaccine for Lyme disease. The experimental pill could provide a more effective prevention strategy for the disease.
