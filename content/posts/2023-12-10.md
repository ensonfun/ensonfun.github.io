## 1. [Fuzzy Finding with Emacs Instead of Fzf](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38590164)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article discusses a command-line tool called fzf that allows users to filter long lists of output by selecting specific items. The author suggests using Emacs instead of fzf because it has better fuzzy finding capabilities and is already a commonly used text editor. The author provides a shell script called ezf that allows users to filter and select match candidates using Emacs. The script works by sending input to emacsclient, the client in the Emacs client-server duo, and returning the selected items. The script also includes command argument parsing and handles different completion tools such as completing-read and Helm.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author questions the excitement around RISC-V, an open instruction set architecture (ISA). They argue that it does not offer additional freedoms to users and does not imply truly open hardware. The author believes that the enthusiasm is primarily due to Chinese companies wanting to avoid paying for ARM licenses. They also argue that even if a RISC-V CPU eventually matches x86-64 in performance and price, it would still be a worse deal due to inferior software support and the loss of x86's backward compatibility. The potential advantage of lower power consumption through RISC-V is acknowledged, but the author suggests that the true impact of the ISA on power consumption is uncertain.

### Summary

 Meta (formerly Facebook) has introduced Audiobox, a new AI model that advances generative AI for audio. Audiobox combines generation and editing capabilities for speech, sound effects, and soundscapes. It allows users to use natural language prompts to describe the sounds or speech they want to generate. The model also enables dual input of both voice prompts and text description prompts, offering greater controllability for voice restyling. Audiobox has been tested and shown to outperform previous models in terms of quality, relevance, and style similarity. Meta aims to lower the barrier of accessibility for audio creation with tools like Audiobox, making it easier for anyone to become an audio content creator.

## 8. [AST-grep(sg) is a CLI tool for code structural search, lint, and rewriting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38590984)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article introduces ast-grep, a CLI tool written in Rust for code structural search, linting, and rewriting. It uses abstract syntax tree (AST)-based matching instead of text matching. Users can write patterns similar to ordinary code and it will match code with the same syntactical structure. The tool can be installed from various package managers or built from source. ast-grep's core algorithm is based on tree-sitter's abstract syntax tree and it allows for lightweight static analysis and code manipulation. Its features include an intuitive pattern for finding and replacing AST, a jQuery-like API for AST traversal and manipulation, YAML configuration for creating new linting rules or code modification, and multiple core utilization. The tool aims to make abstract syntax tree manipulation more accessible and convenient.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author shares a tool called `grep-ast` that allows users to grep a regex in code and provides matches in an abstract syntax tree (AST) aware manner. The tool utilizes the AST of the source code to show how the matching lines fit into the code structure and displays relevant code from different layers of the AST. It is particularly useful for understanding how functions, classes, and variables are used in complex codebases. The article includes a code snippet demonstrating the tool's functionality in searching the Django repository.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a recently developed tool called "AST-grep" that is used for finding code patterns using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

The author expresses their surprise at not finding "AST-grep" earlier and praises its capabilities, particularly regarding variable syntax.

## 9. [Trust-based moderation systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38590144)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the problem of removing malicious participants from a chat and presents a decentralized solution called TrustNet. In a centralized context, a moderator can easily remove a malicious participant for all others, but in a distributed context, this becomes more complex. The article suggests a system where participants can choose who moderates on their behalf, thus avoiding the issues associated with a single moderator. TrustNet is a system that allows peers to assign trust values to each other. These trust values are transitive, meaning they can be inherited by others. The system uses trust areas to group related trust assignments. Trust is only transitive within a trust area. By following outgoing trust assignments for a particular peer and their trusted peers, a trust network is created. This network can be used to automatically block malicious peers if others discover that they have been blocked by someone they trust. TrustNet aims to distribute the responsibility of moderation and provide flexibility in managing trust.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is discussing Appleseed, an algorithm and trust metric proposed by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler and Georg Lausen from the University of Freiburg. Appleseed uses a weighted graph structure and is designed to find the most trusted peers. The algorithm works by releasing energy at the trust source and letting it flow through the trust relations, with more energy remaining with the more trusted peers. Once converged, Appleseed produces a ranking of the most trusted peers. The author questions how robust the mechanism is in the face of deliberate attempts to game the system and become the most trusted.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article questions the idea of transitivity of trust and expresses skepticism towards systems that aim to relieve individuals from managing individual trust relations by creating leaders/deciders and passive followers. The author also doubts the feasibility of one-size-fits-all solutions for trust tracking, as some applications require slow and iterative processes while others demand critical and immediate responses. The author speculates that the discussed system is designed for social media chat.

## 10. [Stealthy Linux rootkit found in the wild after going undetected for 2 years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38590827)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Researchers from security firm Group-IB have uncovered a stealthy and multifunctional Linux malware called "Krasue" that has been infecting telecommunications companies for the past two years. The malware, named after a spirit in Southeast Asian folklore, primarily targets victims in Thailand and poses a severe risk to critical systems and sensitive data. Krasue utilizes rootkit techniques to conceal its presence on the infected system. Its infection vectors are still unknown, but possible methods include vulnerability exploitation, credential theft, and being installed as a trojan disguised as legitimate software. Krasue incorporates three open source rootkit packages that allow it to hide directories, files, and processes from the operating system. The malware also intercepts the kill() system call to evade termination attempts.
