**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses the history of Kongō Gumi, the oldest continuously run company in the world. It was established in Japan in the year 578 and initially specialized in building Buddhist temples. Over the centuries, the company prospered by reconstructing Osaka Castle multiple times after it was destroyed by fire and lightning. However, the decline of Buddhism and the bursting of Japan's real estate bubble in the 1990s forced Kongō Gumi to pivot its expertise towards crafting coffins. In 2006, the company became a subsidiary of Taka­mat­su Construction Group. Despite these changes, Kongō Gumi's miyadaiku, or carpenters trained in the art of building Buddhist temples, continue to use traditional tools and techniques. The company is praised for maintaining its high level of craftsmanship and has attracted international attention.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The Kongō Construction company, which had a history of over 1,400 years, faced financial difficulties and was eventually purchased in January 2006. Following the buyout, the company only continued in its real estate division and changed its name to KJ Construction Co., Ltd. However, in July 2006, KJ Construction filed for bankruptcy due to lack of funds. Despite this, the company had an impressive track record.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the continuity of ancient buildings, but highlights that they are not as old as they appear. It fails to mention the fact that Japanese temples are regularly rebuilt every 20-60 years. This recurring revenue model tied to religious rebuilding is unique to the construction of these temples and is not commonly found in other construction businesses.

 The article discusses the concept of multithreading and pokes fun at its complexity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author, who is a chip designer, is building a stained glass window for their front entrance. The design will be a half adder, which is much smaller than a Pentium chip. The challenge lies in representing all the different layers of the chip, such as silicon, implantation, poly, metal, and vias, with only one level of metal. The final result will be more like a thin layered sculpture rather than a traditional stained glass window.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses the use of Dublin Core (DC) metadata in museums during the 90s. They mention a government-funded project called "New Opportunities Fund" that mandated DC markup for creating cross-site searchable assets. However, the envisioned portal for searching across all the funded sites was never created. The author highlights the ongoing conversation about interoperability in museum data, with one side advocating for Semantic Web approaches and the other supporting lightweight microformats. The author personally leans towards the latter camp, believing that crude descriptions are preferable to complex and unimplementable standards. They note that advancements in search technology and AI have made some of these discussions less relevant. Nevertheless, there are still numerous data interop projects in museums and cultural heritage, such as the Museums Data Service and TANC.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In the article, the author shares their personal experience with a defragmentation process taking an extended amount of time. They mention starting the defrag before leaving for the day and returning the next morning to find it still running. Due to concerns about the machine's stability, they couldn't restart it. The author explains that this issue was problematic because version control was being used on the machine. Despite seeking assistance from Microsoft, it was discovered that defragmentation on that specific version of Windows took place in real mode, leading to increased seeking time on the hard drive. The author expresses frustration with this inefficiency.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The only confusion the author found in the article is that it is not clear that the first blinking block is a data block. The author suggests that starting with no block selected and requiring the user to press Enter/Space to begin the game, at which point the first data block starts blinking, would make it clearer. The game reminds the author of Sokoban.

Scientific analysis has shown that the silver used to make the vessel came from a mine in modern-day Iran. The vessel will be displayed at the British Museum's Silk Roads exhibition.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article emphasizes the connections that existed through trade in the past. The Romans sourced pearls from Sri Lanka, even though they may never have been there personally. They had contacts who traded along the Silk Road and obtained pearls from Sri Lanka. Trade often transcends religious barriers, as shown by the Vikings who served the Byzantine courts. It is possible that they traveled from the north or along the coast, and may have brought back items to North Europe. Valuable goods like walrus ivory or amber could have been traded in return.
