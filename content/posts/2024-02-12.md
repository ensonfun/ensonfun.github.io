## 1. [AMD funded a drop-in CUDA implementation built on ROCm: It's now open-source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39344815)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The article discusses an effort by AMD to make it easier for developers to port codebases targeting NVIDIA's CUDA API to run on AMD's ROCm stack. This effort involves creating a drop-in replacement at the library level so that many CUDA applications can run on AMD GPUs without the need to modify the source code. The project, called ZLUDA, was initially developed for Intel graphics but has now been adapted for AMD GPUs. The article mentions that ZLUDA supports running CUDA-enabled software on AMD ROCm without any changes and even proprietary renderers are compatible. However, it notes that there are some limitations, such as incomplete support for NVIDIA OptiX and software that doesn't use PTX assembly code. The ZLUDA implementation is open-source and dual-licensed under Apache 2.0 or MIT. The article also mentions that the exposed device name for Radeon GPUs via CUDA has been set to a generic "Graphics Device" string to avoid leaking the use of Radeon GPUs, but this is expected to change with the release of the ZLUDA code. Additionally, the article encourages readers to support the site through Phoronix Premium to access ad-free content and other features.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 AMD has decided to stop funding the development of ZLUDA, a project aimed at running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs. As a result, the developer has been given permission to release it. This move is seen as similar to a previous mistake made by Intel.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions the existence of undocumented functions called the CUDA Dark API. Although the number of these functions is unknown, debugging suggests that there are multiple function pointers across various tables. Typically, an application will only use one or two of these functions. The Dark API functions are exclusively used by the Runtime API, NVIDIA libraries, and CUDA applications. However, the names of these functions, as well as the names and types of their arguments, are not known. Implementing these functions is time-consuming because they need to be reverse-engineered and implemented on a case-by-case basis when an application is observed using them.

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 Cloudflare has celebrated another victory against patent trolls. A jury in Texas found that Cloudflare did not infringe on a patent asserted by patent trolls Sable IP and Sable Networks. Furthermore, the jury declared that Sable's patent claim was invalid and never should have been granted. Cloudflare has been actively fighting against patent trolls for seven years and has utilized its Project Jengo to crowdsource prior art to invalidate patents. Through its efforts, Cloudflare has invalidated significant parts of three Sable patents, limiting their ability to sue other companies. This recent victory serves as a warning to patent trolls that Cloudflare will not be intimidated.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of large companies obtaining and using "bullshit patents" to sue small startup competitors, even if they are likely to lose the case. The author argues that the problem lies in the granting of these obvious and unoriginal patents, as patent clerks lack expertise in the field and have little incentive to deny such patents. The author suggests changing the incentives so that companies that successfully defend against these patents are financially rewarded by both the suing company and the patent office. This would make patent offices more cautious in granting patents and discourage the filing of frivolous patents. The article concludes by stating that the patent system needs the right incentives to maintain its positive aspects while eliminating the current drawbacks.

 The article discusses how Newegg, a company known for combating patent trolls, aggressively fights against them. However, the article does not provide any specific details about Newegg's actions against patent trolls.

## 3. [How SSH port became 22](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39313170)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 This article explains how the default SSH (Secure Shell) port became 22. The author, Tatu Ylonen, designed SSH in 1995 as a replacement for telnet and ftp. To allocate a port for SSH, Ylonen contacted IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), and Jon Postel and Joyce K. Reynolds assigned port number 22 to SSH. Since then, port 22 has become the default for SSH servers. The article also mentions that the port number can be changed in the server's configuration file, and that SSH is commonly permitted through firewalls. It advises on practical alternatives for inbound access and highlights the potential risks of unrestricted outbound SSH.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the history and usage of the SSH protocol. The author clarifies that SSH was actually designed to replace the rsh command, not telnet and FTP as commonly believed. The author mentions that telnet and FTP were not widely used internally, while rsh, rlogin, and rcp were more prevalent. The author also suggests that if encryption was desired for telnet, it could have been implemented within the standard telnet protocol.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article explains that the -p option can be used to specify the port number when using the ssh command on Linux. Additionally, the -P option (capital P) can be used with SFTP and scp. The article emphasizes the annoyance of SSH/scp.

## 4. [It Can Be Done (2003)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39342143)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The article discusses the story of André Bensoussan, who worked on the Multics operating system at Honeywell. He was tasked with designing, implementing, and testing a subsystem called the VTOC manager, which managed file description information. André spent a lot of time creating diagrams to capture all the necessary information and make them visually appealing. He then wrote the code in pencil at his desk, declined typing help, and continuously made revisions until he typed the final program into a terminal. Despite a few typos, the code compiled successfully, and the VTOC manager worked perfectly, with only one bug discovered later due to an error made by the author. The article highlights André's remarkable achievement using only a pencil for his design and implementation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article suggests that the main reason someone was able to develop a successful software was because they had clearly defined requirements. The author argues that much of the software today is buggy and slow because developers are unclear about what they are building and because of constant changes in requirements. The article concludes that if developers are given a clear API and well-defined criteria, they are more likely to write effective code.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that a defector from the Soviet Union shared that Soviet programmers were highly skilled because they had limited access to computers. They had to rely on programming with pencil and paper, which forced them to make sure their code was correct from the beginning.

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 OpenStreetMap is introducing vector tiles on openstreetmap.org, a significant advancement in how map data is processed and presented. To lead the vector tiles project, Paul Norman has been hired, a renowned figure in cartography and open data. Unlike traditional raster tiles, vector tiles store geodata in a format that allows for dynamic styling and interactivity, enabling users to adapt the visual appearance of the map without altering the data. This investment in vector tile software will bring a new, modern-looking map style with seamless zoom to openstreetmap.org. In the future, it will also enable 3D maps, more efficient data mixing and matching, integration of other datasets, thematic styles, multilingual maps, different views for administrative boundaries, and more. The OpenStreetMap Foundation depends on donations to complete this project, and users can support it by donating specifically for vector tiles. The introduction of vector tiles is seen as a leap in aesthetics and functionality, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the stagnation in development of OpenStreetMap's default style called Carto on its website, openstreetmap.org. The maintainers have neglected to render accepted features such as highway=busway and have not provided support for them, resulting in gaps on the baseline map. Although a new effort to improve the situation is mentioned, the author expresses skepticism and prefers using OpenStreetMap through other apps like OsmAnd and OrganicMaps. The Tracestrack Topo layer on openstreetmap.org is praised as being decent.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The writer explains that they have OsmAnd on their phone, allowing them to download maps and navigation data for their country from OpenStreetMaps. They are looking for a similar solution for a PC but find it difficult to generate map tiles and navigate offline. They mention QGIS as an option for displaying vectors but find it challenging to style the data. They ask if there are any other options available for offline navigation on a Linux PC.

## 7. [Cousins are disappearing. Is this reshaping the experience of childhood?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39340501)

**Total comment counts : 52**

### Summary

 A new study has found that the number of cousins in families is declining due to decreasing fertility rates. As grandparents and great-grandparents live longer, the number of cousins, nieces, and nephews is projected to decline. This trend is observed globally, including in Canada, where the average 15-year-old girl is expected to have only 3.6 living cousins in 2095, compared to 15.3 in 1950. Researchers emphasize the importance of extended family ties, which provide support and companionship throughout individuals' lives. The decline in cousins is linked to the decreasing fertility rate and the increasing number of families choosing to have only one child.

## 8. [28-ton, 1.2-megawatt tidal kite is now exporting power to the grid](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39342532)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 Minesto has developed a unique method for generating renewable energy from tidal flows using its Dragon series devices. Unlike traditional tidal turbines that harness energy from currents while stationary, Minesto's devices are anchored to the sea bed and fly around like kites underwater, leveraging the tidal currents as wind. This dynamic approach allows the Dragon to extract more energy from the tides, even in slower flows. The Dragon 12, the largest device in the series, has a 12-meter wingspan and weighs 28 tons. It can be easily installed using a small boat and a sea bed tether. The levelized cost of energy (LCoE) for the Dragon 12 is projected to be around $108/MWh initially, with potential for costs to decrease to $54/MWh in the future. The first Dragon device has been deployed in the Faroe Islands, where strong tidal currents offer favorable conditions for energy generation. It has recently been connected to the local power grid and is now delivering electricity. Minesto sees this achievement as a significant milestone for the company and emphasizes the competitiveness, power, cost-effectiveness, and predictability of the Dragon 12 in contributing renewable electricity to the grid.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the ease of transport and installation of a 1.2MW wind turbine compared to larger ones. It also mentions the potential benefits of smaller turbines, such as less disruption to the skyline and reduced impact on wildlife.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's concerns about renewable energy sources, particularly in regard to their potential for causing catastrophic consequences if scaled up massively. The author questions whether these energy sources, such as hydro, solar, and geothermal, are truly renewable or if they extract energy from a finite reservoir. The author also mentions the possibility of tidal energy, which they suggest may be considered as an endless solar energy source dependent on wind-generated waves. The article concludes by suggesting that these renewable energy reservoirs are so massive that the amount we could potentially extract from them is virtually limitless, although the author acknowledges the difficulty in finding specific numbers to support these thoughts.
