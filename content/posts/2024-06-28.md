## 7. [Git-cliff â€“ Generate changelog from the Git history](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40798469)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The article discusses git-cliff, a customizable changelog generator that uses custom parsers and can easily be configured to match desired formats. It can generate changelog files for any Git repository following conventional commits specification. git-cliff can be integrated into Rust/Python/Node.js projects as a command-line tool or used as a library for Rust projects.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses their dislike for auto-generated commit logs as they tend to have excessive noise. They believe that changelogs should be for users to read. They have a program that generates the initial draft of the rclone changelog from the first line of each git commit. They encourage contributors to make their commit message a user-friendly description for the changelog. However, they still spend about an hour editing the auto-generated changelog, removing noise, condensing entries, reorganizing, and improving clarity where necessary. They prioritize important information and aim to keep the changelog brief since users do not want to spend hours reading it. They also mention the difficulty of enforcing a specific commit message format, and therefore, find it necessary to manually edit the changelog. While it would be ideal to avoid spending so much time on editing the changelog, they believe it is their responsibility to provide a well-crafted changelog for the users and cannot delegate that task to a program.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that using commit log diffs as changelogs is not a good idea because commit logs contain noise such as merge commits, commits with obscure titles, and documentation changes. The purpose of a commit is to document a step in the evolution of the source code, while a changelog entry is meant to document noteworthy differences and communicate them clearly to end users.
