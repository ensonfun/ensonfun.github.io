## 3. [Ex-Kansas police chief who raided local newspaper criminally charged](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41240755)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Former Marion police chief, Gideon Cody, has been charged with felony obstruction of justice for allegedly persuading a potential witness to withhold information during the investigation of his conduct. The charge accuses Cody of knowingly or intentionally influencing the witness to withhold information on the day of a raid on a weekly newspaper and the home of its publisher, or within the following six days. The raid, which sparked a national debate about press freedom, took place in Marion, Kansas. The publisher of the newspaper, Eric Meyer, believes that Cody is being made the "fall guy" for the raid and expects the case to be resolved through a plea bargain. The charge against Cody does not provide specific details about his alleged conduct. A report from two special prosecutors revealed text messages between Cody and a local business owner, with Cody allegedly asking her to delete the messages. Cody had justified the raid by claiming that Meyer, the newspaper, and one of its reporters had committed identity theft or other computer crimes. However, the prosecutors' report concluded that no crime was committed by Meyer, the reporter, or the newspaper, and that Cody had reached an erroneous conclusion due to a poor investigation.

## 4. [MVSplat: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Multi-View Images](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41222655)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The author of the article presents qualitative comparisons between their model, MVSplat, and the state-of-the-art model, pixelSplat. They claim that MVSplat produces higher-quality 3D Gaussian primitives. They provide ".ply" files for the 3D Gaussians produced by both models for readers to compare. They recommend using online viewers like 3D Gaussian Splatting with Three.js to view the files. The article also states that MVSplat is superior in generalizing to out-of-distribution novel scenes because the cost volume captures the relative similarity between features. They demonstrate this by training models on RealEstate10K (indoor scenes) and testing them directly on DTU (object-centric scenes) and ACID (outdoor scenes). The article mentions that the template used was borrowed from Nerfies, which is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. The author encourages readers to provide feedback and ask questions to Yuedong Chen.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses the current state of the tech stack in the "splat world," a reference to a specific technology or field. They mention MVSplat, a tool that generates splats for renderings, and their desire to use it to create renderings of a field near their house. However, they note that they need camera pose data to use MVSplat effectively. They discuss the challenges of obtaining accurate camera pose data from outdoor photos and mention a tool called FAR that claims to provide up to 80% pose accuracy. The author expresses uncertainty about how MVSplat will handle 80% accurate camera pose data and whether they should use a pre-trained model or train their own. They also mention the availability of iPhone apps and commercial projects like Skydio that offer similar functionality but at a higher cost. The author anticipates that in the future, there will be more user-friendly and affordable tools based on open models, but acknowledges that there is still progress to be made in this area.

**Total comment counts : 47**

### Summary

 Disney has asked a Florida court to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit filed against them due to anaphylaxis, citing an arbitration waiver in the terms and conditions of Disney+. The lawsuit was filed by Jeffrey Piccolo, husband of Kanokporn Tangsuan, a doctor who passed away after eating a meal at a Disney Springs restaurant. Disney claims Piccolo agreed to arbitration when signing up for a free trial of Disney+ and purchasing tickets through the My Disney Experience app. Piccolo's attorneys argue that it is unreasonable for Disney to enforce an agreement that he never signed.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a bug in the legal system that allows companies like Disney to win by filing a motion or claim. Even if the motion is denied, they can wear down their opponent who has limited resources and is personally affected by the case dragging out. This makes the opponent more likely to accept a lower settlement. The only downside for Disney is minimal legal costs. The article suggests that courts should be able to issue sanctions or extra damages for using such tactics to deter companies from playing this game. This way, the potential consequences could double the award and make companies less eager to use these sleazy tricks.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the potential consequences of implied contract acceptance and the importance of specificity in contracts. It suggests that certain transactions, when accompanied by an implied contract acceptance, could result in a loophole that allows parent companies and associated entities to evade responsibility indefinitely. The author expresses hope that the justice system will address this legal theory and emphasizes the need for precise and detailed contractual terms to avoid potential complications.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses changes that have occurred since the writing of a book about Rust's Mutex and RwLock implementation on Windows. The author mentions that Rust moved to WaitOnAddress on Windows 8 and beyond, and highlights a bug found in SRWLocks that has not been fixed in released Windows versions. The bug causes SRWLocks to occasionally give a Write Lock instead of a Read Lock, potentially causing issues with concurrency. The author suggests that this bug arises from the authors of SRWLocks assuming they do not know whether a read or write lock is requested in certain edge cases, leading them to always provide a write lock.

 Researchers have successfully sent 20,000 entangled photons per second down a 34-km-long section of a fiber-optic network in New York with a fidelity of 99%. This achievement is a major step toward the commercialization of quantum networks. The researchers used polarization entanglement and developed a method to compensate for the stresses and disturbances that optical fibers experience, which could disrupt the entanglement. The demonstration ran continuously for 15 days with an uptime of 99.84%. The results of this study impressed experts and suggest the possibility of deploying quantum networks in the real world.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a concept called "quantum eruv," which is similar to the Jewish religious concept of an eruv. The eruv is an enclosed area that allows observant Jews to carry objects on the Sabbath, which would normally be prohibited. In the context of quantum computing, the quantum eruv refers to the ability to entangle distant qubits, or quantum bits, in a large-scale quantum system. The article mentions that the eruv has a certain number of photons per second and fidelity percentages, but it does not provide information on the actual bandwidth needed for practical usage or computation.

## 8. [Sort, sweep, and prune: Collision detection algorithms (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41241942)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses collision detection algorithms in video game programming, specifically focusing on the sweep-and-prune algorithm. The author explains the problem of collision detection and the need for efficient algorithms. They start by demonstrating a simple solution of testing every potential pair of objects for collision. However, this approach has performance issues and has a time complexity of O(n^2). The author then explores ways to improve this solution, starting with optimizing the intersects() function. They explain how the short-circuit evaluation of the && operator can be used to optimize the collision detection process. The author highlights the importance of focusing on individual axis checks and suggests using the separating axis theorem to determine if two objects are colliding. They conclude by stating that optimizing in one axis can make a significant difference in the overall performance of the collision detection algorithm.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author suggests using a "fast" sorting algorithm like mergesort/quicksort for best performance in collision detection systems. However, in practice, insertion sort may provide better performance because objects in these systems tend to move relatively small steps between frames. This means that lists from the previous frame are already mostly sorted, and insertion sort performs well on such lists, approaching O(n) complexity, while quicksort approaches O(n^2) complexity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses continuous collision detection and provides a link to a document that explains it. The author praises the performance of a physics library called BepuPhysics2, but mentions that integrating it can be challenging due to the level of optimization required.
