## 1. [Bluesky migrates to single-tenant SQLite](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38171322)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article discusses the refactoring of the PDS (Personal DataStore) to use a single-tenant SQLite datastore. Each user now has their own SQLite file to store their repository and private account state. The user databases are stored hierarchically, and repo signing keys are stored alongside the SQLite file. The article also mentions the use of an ActorStore for interacting with user data, which requires clear transactional writes. An LRUCache is used for managing signing keys and databases, with a limit of 30k file handles and keys in memory. Additionally, three separate SQLite databases are introduced for managing service state, with concurrent reads and streaming replication enabled. The article mentions the intention to use Litestream or a similar tool for the PDS distribution.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges and drawbacks of using a schema or database per tenant setup in a shared instance. It mentions the issue of row-level security and the potential for different schema versions during data migration. The article suggests that while this setup has its merits, many companies are moving away from it due to the associated problems. The author also mentions their own experience, having progressed from a SQLite per tenant setup to a schema per tenant on Postgres, and now finally to a single schema with row-level security.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article is discussing a statement regarding concurrent transactions in SQLite. The author argues that SQLite does support concurrent transactions as long as the .db file is not accessed through a file share (UNC, or NFS, etc.). They have been using this feature to update/read the database from multiple threads/processes on the same machine. They also mention that snapshotting with the SQLite backup API can be used for consistent viewing without holding on to a transaction or copying in-memory. However, the author admits that they may be missing something since they haven't used SQLite in years.

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article discusses data encryption in PostgreSQL and explores the available options for encrypting data. By default, PostgreSQL does not have data encryption, so it is important to implement encryption to protect sensitive data. The article explains different types of encryption, including encryption-at-rest and field encryption, and discusses their limitations. It also mentions the "pg_crypto" module in PostgreSQL, which provides encryption functions but is not recommended due to security vulnerabilities. The article introduces Enquo, a project that offers application-layer encryption that allows for efficient querying of encrypted data within the database. The author's goal is to eventually encrypt all data.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of Order Preserving Encryption (OPE), which allows for encrypting data like dates of birth in a way that it can still be queried for certain conditions without revealing the underlying data. However, the article argues that this is a dangerous oversimplification, as attackers can still infer age ranges and distributions. The author emphasizes the importance of considering the nuances and tradeoffs involved in OPE. The article also mentions a paper that provides further information on this topic.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a project that implements encryption and decryption of private data at the client side using envelope encryption. It uses a random AES key to encrypt the data and the key is then encrypted with a public key using KMS (Key Management Service) for added security. The project also uses blind indexes for lookups and mentions the need to order encrypted data, which can be achieved using order-respecting encryption algorithms like the Lewi-Yu scheme. The author is interested in learning more about the project and suggests integration with a service like KMS for storing and retrieving encryption keys to ensure auditability of data decryption.

## 8. [Apple's Trademark Exploit](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38171648)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Apple uses a loophole in trademark law to exploit Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) in order to seize competing products. Apple registers its logo trademark with CBP and pays fees to ensure stricter enforcement on the trademarks they request. CBP seizes goods that it identifies as counterfeit and destroys or sells them at auction. Apple participates in CBP's e-Recordation Program and gets to train law enforcement on how to identify their products. CBP has seized legal, non-counterfeit products from companies such as OnePlus because Apple claimed they violated their trademark. This system allows Apple to harm consumers, attack competitors, and inject risk into buying products from their rivals.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the case of 2,000 seized OnePlus Buds by US Customs and Border Protection, mistaken for counterfeit Apple AirPods. The agency released a statement defending the seizure, while OnePlus criticized the move and argued for the authenticity of their product. It is not mentioned whether the company wrote off the shipment or continued selling the seized units.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the confiscation of "grey market" or illegal products that feature the Apple logo. If a manufacturer has the Apple logo on a part, it likely means that the manufacturer made that part specifically for Apple and is not allowed to produce more for other customers. Additionally, if these pieces were made for Apple but did not pass quality assurance, the manufacturer is not permitted to sell them and must instead destroy them. Therefore, if an Apple logo is present on a product, it is either a counterfeit item, a stolen official part, or a failed QA product that should have been recycled. The author suggests that if they were to pay a manufacturer for a compatible part, they would not expect to see an Apple logo on it.
