## 1. [Nitro: A tiny but flexible init system and process supervisor](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44988530)

**Total comment counts : 0**

### Summary

 Nitro is a tiny process supervisor that can run as pid 1 on Linux. It’s configured by a directory of scripts (default /etc/nitro). Each service dir can contain a run script; dirs ending with @ are ignored, but parametrized services can be addressed via symlinks or nitroctl. Lifecycle: up first runs SYS/setup, then brings up other services; on exit, services restart (with a possible 2s delay). Shutdown/reboot uses SYS/finish, sends SIGTERM to all (up to 7s), then SIGKILL, then SYS/final; reboot re-execs with an absolute path. nitroctl supports rescan, reboot, shutdown; signals also work. Self-contained, static binary, 0BSD; Leah Neukirchen.

## 2. [The First Media over QUIC CDN: Cloudflare](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44987924)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 Cloudflare has announced Media over QUIC (MoQ) as an official, testable CDN product on its global network. MoQ is an emerging standard for live media, aiming to supplant WebRTC, HLS/DASH, and RTMP/SRT. Cloudflare provides a public relay endpoint for testing with various clients. The post promotes hang.live, mentions browser-based live publishing and AI-generated captions, and notes this is a technical preview limited to a draft subset. Cloudflare uses a forked codebase, introducing bugs. Users can also self-host moq-relay via Terraform; authentication and WebSocket fallback are in progress.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 A Cloudflare MoQ developer greets readers, offers to answer questions, and thanks user kixelated for an award (with a playful xD).

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The tech is viable as long as major browsers support it, even if it’s not obvious in caniuse. If webview engines like Edge WebView2 add support, developers could use it immediately by wrapping it. However, for real usefulness, mainstream apps like OBS and YouTube must also implement support.

## 3. [FFmpeg 8.0](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44985730)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 FFmpeg 8.0 "Huffman" is a major release with native decoders (APV, ProRes RAW, RealVideo 6.0, Sanyo LD-ADPCM, G.728), VVC decoder improvements (IBC, ACT, Palette Mode), Vulkan compute-based codecs (FFv1 encode/decode; ProRes RAW decode), and hardware-accelerated decoding (Vulkan VP9, VAAPI VVC, OpenHarmony H264/5) and encoding (Vulkan AV1, OpenHarmony H264/5). It adds new formats (MCC, G.728, Whip, APV) and filters, plus a Vulkan-based dec/enc class; ProRes RAW decode-only; upgrade recommended. FFmpeg 7.1 "Péter" stabilizes VVC, adds xHE-AAC/USAC, MV-HEVC, Vulkan encoding, color-range fixes, and cropping metadata; upgrade advised.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 FFmpeg is highlighted as a crucial tool for audio/video automation, with FFmpeg.Wasm noted as well. In January 2024, the author used FFmpeg to extract frames from a 1993 anime in 15-minute segments, upscaled them with Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan, and recombined the frames into a 4K version. They suggest that a UI built around this workflow could resemble Topaz AI, a popular tool.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Compute-shader based video encoders and decoders are emerging. Hardware codecs today mainly cover H.264, H.265, and AV1, so cross-platform acceleration for others would be welcome even if less efficient. The ProRes encoder looks useful for current projects. However, only codecs designed for parallelized decoding can be implemented this way; mainstream codecs aren’t planned for support. Many codecs aren’t amenable to compute-shader decoding due to the need for tens of thousands of threads and data dependencies across frames or tiles. Encoders might have more flexibility; encoding formats like VP9 could be an interesting challenge.

## 4. [Should the web platform adopt XSLT 3.0?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44987552)

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 Discussion follows up on #11523 about security, maintainability, and the aging browser code used to render XML with XSLT. It explores alternatives to deprecation and how to mitigate risks for vendors and users, focusing on XSLT 3.0 support and cross-browser issues. XSLT 1.0 (1999) remains widely unsupported beyond 1.0 in browsers, with open issues like disable-output-escaping. The author questions whether low current usage reflects usefulness or 1.0 limitations, sharing a CMS project built entirely on XSLT and noting no prescriptive solution, stressing weighing pros and cons of deprecation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 An imagined alternate world where XML standards prevailed didn’t come to be. Modern tooling and ecosystems—Docker and Kubernetes—made standards less critical, and by containerization’s rise XML had largely faded. Python and its superior JSON libraries, plus few XML specs achieving mainstream traction, fueled the decline. Much XML work yields little payoff; XSLT was supposed to glue things, but there’s nothing cohesive to glue. XML also resists streaming technologies. The author suspects XML could return someday, or another SGML dialect, but not now.

## 5. [Sprinkling self-doubt on ChatGPT](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44987422)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 A few weeks after applying a self-prompt to ChatGPT personalization, the author notes immediate changes: most initial responses begin with a positive framing about increased usefulness, with only marginal improvements. The end-of-request “red team” analysis often spots errors and leads to correct answers, reducing skepticism. Even when wrong, the long reasoning times feel worth the GPU cost. The piece closes with promotional notes: subscribing is free, plus a rapid-essay newsletter and a long-form podcast called Breaking Change.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 We’ve been building agent [0] and found that making it confident causes fear and wasted tool use. Correct answers come at the cost of anxiety, with agents burning time on tool calls and even browsing media instead of inspecting code. It's better to make uncertainty and exploration part of success criteria. A bad prompt like 'Critique your own thoughts' leads the agent to overexplain and avoid error; a good prompt like 'Expose where your thoughts are unsupported or need more information' yields higher-quality results with usable loose ends. Paired with reasoning via API or prompt tuning, this approach outperforms training.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 An author describes GPT-5’s Advanced Voice, which enforces emotionless, plain replies and bans metaphors. In a pizza scenario, the assistant gives direct, no-frills guidance without emotional reinforcement, which the author finds useless. After the subscription expired, it behaved normally again; upon renewal it returned to the old style. The author now prefers Claude and wonders if the behavior persists across conversations.

## 6. [Launch HN: BlankBio (YC S25) - Making RNA Programmable](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44986809)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 BlankBio grew from open-source PhD work on RNA design, aiming to move from low-level sequence tinkering to high-level abstractions. mRNA therapeutics hold promise but are bottlenecked by opaque sequences and trial‑and‑error optimization. They’re building generalizable RNA embeddings via self-supervised, contrastive learning on unlabeled data, showing that functionally similar sequences cluster better than predicting nucleotides. Their 10M-parameter Orthrus model trained on 4 GPUs in 14 hours outperforms a 40B-parameter Evo2 trained for a month. They envision code-like RNA design (half_life, cell_type, expression) and seek biotechs, feedback, and partnerships; open-source model used by Sanofi & GSK.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Commenter is cautiously interested in a “compiler for DNA” but sees it as promising yet with few results and some marketing. They seek clarity on: ground-truth for evaluations (is mRNABench involved?); whether the mRNABench paper is peer-reviewed or just a preprint; if results show performance on out-of-sequence mRNA sequences; whether the model aims to predict properties of natural versus synthetic mRNA; how many mRNA sequences have experimental verification (the paper notes a figure of 66). They praise incremental progress and vision but want a clearer view of the current state-of-the-art.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author supports the premise and favors domain-specific models (e.g., Orthrus) over large foundation models (e.g., Evo2). They inquire about data-collection strategy to improve algorithmic design, asking whether in-house experimental capacity will generate datasets or if data generation will be largely outsourced to partners.

## 7. [Show HN: Clyp – Clipboard Manager for Linux](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44986205)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Clyp is a modern, fast, simple clipboard manager for Linux. Its watcher is a minimal headless Gtk application that monitors the clipboard and notifies the GUI of database changes via a UNIX socket. Clipboard history is stored in SQLite3 at ~/.local/share/bio.murat.clyp/clyp.db. It follows the XDG Base Directory specification and can be launched from the application menu.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author doubts Wayland's global clipboard access, notes that popular clipboard managers still don’t work reliably and look unattractive, and says clipboard handling has been a major pain point when switching from macOS to Linux or Windows, ending with a likely sarcastic “Great job.”

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece praises Windows’ clipboard history: pressing Super+V shows a list of recent clipboard entries you can paste from, and you can pin entries to keep them always accessible. The author hasn’t seen a Linux clipboard manager with this behavior and wonders if one exists that works similarly.

## 8. [Scientists just found a protein that reverses brain aging](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44988393)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Researchers at UCSF identified FTL1 as central to hippocampal aging. Old mice had more FTL1, fewer neural connections, and poorer memory. Increasing FTL1 in young mice induced aging-like brain changes; reducing FTL1 in old mice restored connectivity and memory. In cultured neurons, high FTL1 yielded simple, unbranched neurites, while lowering FTL1 promoted normal branching. FTL1 also slowed hippocampal cell metabolism, which could be reversed with metabolic stimulation. The team is hopeful that therapies blocking FTL1 could counteract age-related brain decline.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 New research suggests ketones might reverse brain aging when administered during a midlife “critical window.” The discussion links this to broader factors: maintaining blood-sugar control appears key to slowing brain aging; immune system changes may drive brain aging; and aging may proceed via nonlinear transitions, implying a distinct midlife period where interventions could be most effective. Related posts and data points on the topic circulate in online discussions, highlighting a convergence of metabolic, immune, and timing factors in cognitive aging.

 A recurring headline keeps showing up in my parents' spam folder about every two weeks for twenty years.

## 9. [Io_uring, kTLS and Rust for zero syscall HTTPS server](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44980865)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article traces the evolution of high‑capacity web servers: from pre-forking to threads, then poll/select, then epoll; it explains io_uring’s queue-based model that lets apps batch work for the kernel to consume asynchronously, turning many syscalls into memory writes and completion events. Both kernel and user space busy-wait minimally on a completion queue, enabling a busy server with few syscalls. It advocates per-core threads on NUMA machines, pre-allocating per-connection memory to avoid fragmentation, and notes kernel/user memory tradeoffs. It also mentions kTLS offloading TLS to the kernel after the handshake to reduce user-space crypto work.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Write operations with io-uring require that the involved memory buffers remain valid, but current crates don’t enforce this with the Rust borrow checker or runtime checks. As a result, building a safe async Rust wrapper around io-uring is difficult and disappointing. Tokio’s Alice notes limited motivation to tackle these issues since current performance is “good enough.” A linked blog post provides background.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 A reader praises the piece and looks forward to performance tests. They recall early experiences building a database/backend and realizing CGI spawned a new process per request. They note how sendfile boosted concurrency for a large gaming forum. Despite vowing off such work, they cite Netflix’s 40 ms saving and GTA V’s 70% load-time reduction as impactful examples that rekindle their interest in performance engineering.

## 10. [Show HN: Pinch – macOS voice translation for real-time conversations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44961153)
