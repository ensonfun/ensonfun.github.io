## 1. [We are beginning to roll out new voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37642335)

**Total comment counts : 90**

### Summary

 OpenAI is introducing new voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT. Users will now be able to have voice conversations with ChatGPT and share images for various purposes. Voice conversations can be used for tasks such as requesting bedtime stories or settling debates, while images can be used to troubleshoot issues, plan meals, or analyze data. The voice capability is powered by a text-to-speech model with multiple voice options and uses a speech recognition system for transcription. Image understanding is enabled by multimodal models that apply language reasoning skills to images. OpenAI aims to gradually make these features available while considering risks and ensuring responsible usage. They have collaborated with professional voice actors and organizations like Be My Eyes to develop the technology. However, there are limitations in ChatGPT's proficiency with languages and accuracy in analyzing and making statements about people. Plus and Enterprise users will start experiencing the voice and image capabilities in the next two weeks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential of voice technology and expresses disappointment in the current performance of voice assistants due to the latency between user queries and responses. The author mentions a local demo using Llama 2 that has a faster response time and feels more like talking to a person. They suggest packaging it for others to try. The main challenge mentioned is determining when a user has finished speaking, which requires a speech conversation turn-taking dataset and model. The author believes that OpenAI could easily build this and suggests that natural voice conversations will expand the user base and applications of these models.

 This article criticizes the layers on the OpenStreetMap website for being a bad user experience (UX). The author suggests renaming some of the layers to make them more descriptive, such as calling the "Standard" layer "roads" or "driving." They also question the need for duplicate layers, such as "CyclOSM" and "Cycle map," as well as the unclear names of layers like "Tracestrack Topo" and "OVPNKarte." The author is unsure about the purpose of the "Humanitarian" layer, speculating it may be for displaying hospitals and other facilities for disaster relief personnel.

## 3. [Unity's oldest community announces dissolution](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37648068)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The Boston Unity Group (BUG), the first official Unity user group in the world, has announced that its final event will take place on September 27th. Over the past 13 years, BUG has hosted monthly meetups and provided a platform for networking, technical lectures, panels, interviews, parties, workshops, and more. BUG's membership has grown from a few dozen to a few thousand, encompassing a wide range of individuals involved in game development and interactive technology. The group was initially supported by Unity and former CEO David Helgason, who recognized the importance of fostering grassroots developer communities. However, Unity has shifted its focus away from supporting developer communities and has made unfavorable changes to its terms of service and pricing, prompting BUG to end its association with the company. BUG organizers now plan to redirect their efforts towards creating opportunities for all developers, regardless of their use of Unity. They encourage members to join the Boston Game Dev meetup group and continue connecting with local developers. The final BUG meeting will be held on September 27th on Zoom. The organizers express their gratitude to the community for their support and contributions and emphasize the importance of continuing to support each other and find new ways to unite.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses frustration that they were not able to make a public claim about Unity's recent pricing changes on Twitter before the company made modifications. They believe this was a deliberate tactic to make the revised announcement more acceptable. The author suggests that this strategy confirms Unity cannot be trusted by small developers. They mention that it is unfortunate to lose a valuable developer community, but it seems like BUG (presumably another group/company) is making the right decision.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses several aspects related to Amazon's investment in the startup company Anthropic. It notes that Amazon's investment is a bet on the future of cloud computing, indicating the importance of compute power. However, it questions the financial soundness of this bet, as smaller models that run on cheaper compute power are currently more popular. The timing of the investment is seen as interesting, suggesting that Anthropic may have shown some promising work recently. However, the article is skeptical of Anthropic's potential as a differentiator in the market. The article also mentions the lack of information about the structure and size of the deal, particularly regarding valuation. It suggests that capturing VC money in the knowledge management/search market is the best outcome for Anthropic, but this market is becoming commoditized. Overall, the prospects for Anthropic are seen as grim.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that integrating OpenAI into products comes with privacy policy issues and the need for extra customer consent. On the other hand, incorporating Amazon services is easier due to their trusted reputation and the use of an AWS stack. It also states that Anthropic / Claude, which is available through Amazon Bedrock, has an advantage for companies already using AWS, while OpenAI has an advantage for those on Azure.

## 7. [Rhythm 0](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37642610)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article discusses Marina Abramović's performance art piece titled Rhythm 0, which took place in Naples in 1974. The performance lasted for six hours and involved Abramović standing still while the audience was encouraged to interact with her using objects placed on a table. The objects ranged from harmless items like roses and feathers to more dangerous ones like a gun and a bullet. Abramović's purpose was to observe the limits of public behavior and see how far they would go. Initially, the audience was gentle, offering her flowers and kisses, but as time went on, the interactions became more intense. Some people cut her clothes, explored her skin with razor blades, and even made sexual advances. Abramović was so committed to the performance that she would not have resisted rape or murder. Eventually, when the performance ended and she started walking towards the audience, everyone ran away, unable to face her as a person. Rhythm 0 has been recognized as one of the greatest works of performance art.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 8. [Show HN: E-Ink Day Schedule](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37642671)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 This article is about a project that involves repurposing second-hand Kindle devices to create a low-power, e-ink based dashboard for everyday life. The author initially had difficulties generating and displaying images on the Kindle, but eventually found a solution using a combination of GoLang's FBInk and a backend API Gateway/Lambda. Additionally, the author used GoLang's tdewolff/canvas for text and image generation. The project is considered a compromise to ensure the device remains productive for several years. The article also mentions information about restoring bricked Kindles and provides a link to a forum for mobile reader hacking.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the potential for jailbreaking or hacking the Kindle device. It highlights that the Kindle is a good starting point for those interested in this activity because it has a USB port and exposes a user partition that can be manipulated. The article mentions that Amazon has attempted to lock down the device, but by reverse-engineering the firmware binary, users can access readable code. The Kindle's startup process is also mentioned, stating that certain files with specific names in the user partition can modify features like disabling the screensaver. Despite Amazon's attempts to patch these methods, the article suggests that alternative ways to achieve the same results can be found through code analysis.

## 9. [An analysis of the Google antitrust trial](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37641393)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Google antitrust trial and raises concerns about the lack of public access and transparency in the proceedings. The author compares the trial to the Microsoft antitrust trial in 1998, which had significant media coverage and public access. The judge in the Google trial, Amit Mehta, has held a significant portion of the trial in closed sessions, inaccessible to the public. This lack of transparency has limited public understanding and reporting on the trial. The article criticizes Judge Mehta for deferring to Google's wishes for secrecy and argues that public access and a public record are crucial for upholding the legitimacy of the legal system. The author also points out that the Department of Justice and the trial team have not been proactive in challenging Google's penchant for secrecy. Despite the lack of transparency, the article notes that more information about Google is still coming to light through the trial.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article claims that the impact of the 1998 Microsoft trial was overstated. Microsoft received a light punishment that they considered a cost of doing business and their behavior remained unchanged. It was not until around 2008, when the EU cases resulted in substantial fines, that Microsoft finally acknowledged the consequences of their actions.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article's title is misleading because it doesn't provide a legal analysis of a $2 trillion antitrust trial. Instead, it focuses on the lack of transparency in the trial and complains about the hidden aspects of it. However, there are still many materials available for analysis despite this lack of transparency.
