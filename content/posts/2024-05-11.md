 The city decided to use LoRawan because it is less complicated legally, despite being more complicated to work with. However, Danish telecom laws restrict the use of such technology and give telecom companies a monopoly on high-speed internet. This also applies to threads. The advantage of using LoRawan in a city is that there are many locations to set up antennas, such as public schools and libraries, which the public does not have access to. The key is to persuade the city to make their LoRawan equivalent open to the public if you want to deploy devices throughout the city. Additionally, the city may provide free access to power supplies and financial support for projects that benefit the city. Ultimately, the advice is to avoid using threads.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that if you are a hobbyist without a lot of money, you cannot legally use Thread, a networking protocol. The author questions if this is really true, suggesting that patents may only apply if there is commercial activity involved. The article further asserts that the current patent regime grants monopolies, as big companies can freely use OpenThread, while small businesses and startups cannot. Overall, the article presents this situation as unfair and suggests that it has a chilling effect.

## 2. [The derivative of a number (2014)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40326305)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses Edward Barbeau, a professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of Toronto, who has worked on increasing interest in mathematics and enhancing education. One of Barbeau's contributions is his definition of the derivative of a number. While the concept of a derivative is commonly understood for functions, Barbeau extends it to natural numbers using specific rules. Despite its interesting nature, Barbeau's derivative of a number has not been extensively studied. However, there have been recent papers exploring its intrinsic properties, solutions to differential equations, growth and inequality results, and potential extensions beyond natural numbers. The article also mentions an attempt to use Barbeau's derivative to prove something unrelated to numbers. Overall, the derivative of a number remains an intriguing concept that may have untapped potential.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains that mathematicians often use the same name for two things with the same "structure," even if they may not seem related. In this case, the shared structure is that both the derivative of a function and D(n) follow the product rule of derivatives. The article goes on to describe how a morphism can be constructed by finding functions for each prime number that have a specific value and derivative. These functions can then be multiplied together for all other natural numbers. The resulting function is called F_n(x), and it involves the prime factors of n. The article concludes by stating that there is a homomorphism between D and the derivatives of functions, which suggests that D is indeed a derivative.

## 4. [So We've Got a Memory Leak](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40315686)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the experience of dealing with a memory leak in a decade-old Rails app. The author explores various tools and techniques for identifying and fixing memory leaks, including profiling memory allocations, generating heap dumps, and analyzing code changes. Despite reviewing recent code changes and making tooling adjustments, the memory leak persisted. The author noticed that the leak occurred only in web Dynos and not in Sidekiq and Delayed::Job Dynos, leading to suspicion that it may be specific to certain types of traffic. The article concludes by mentioning the inability to use OpenTelemetry Traces to pinpoint the cause of the leak due to aggressive sampling.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article does not understand the fear associated with manual memory management. They argue that with proper engineering practices, such as Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) and clear ownership rules, managing memory becomes easy. They find it more challenging to deal with frameworks that use reference counting and shared pointers because ownership becomes unclear. The author believes that memory bugs are no worse than logic bugs and should be fixed as part of engineering discipline. They also point out that they manually manage other resources like operating system handles and sockets, so they question the need for automatic memory management, which they see as complicating the design.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author recalls a story from the 90s about a memory leak in a printer driver in Solaris. They worked for a bank that relied on faxes to confirm trades, and when the memory leak caused a confirmation to not be printed, it resulted in a $5 million loss. Despite senior executives' efforts, the bank was unable to resolve the issue and made a policy to never trade with that particular bank again. The fax printer job was eventually moved to Windows NT. The article also mentions that the memory leak was eventually fixed because Scott McNealy, the CEO of Sun Microsystems at the time, experienced the problem firsthand and pushed for a solution.
