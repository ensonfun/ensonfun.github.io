 In the late 90s, a member of staff at a workplace experienced issues with their mouse. The mouse would stop working between certain hours of the day, particularly during lunchtime. Interestingly, the problem only occurred on sunny days, while it worked perfectly on overcast days. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the issue was caused by the mouse being cheaply made with thin plastic. The mouse operated by shining an LED into a sensor on the X and Y axes, and the sun's brightness on sunny days would overpower the sensor due to the thin plastic case. However, when the sun moved and cast a shadow over the mouse, it would start working again. This explanation seemed logical but initially baffling.

### Summary

 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given authorization to Zipline International, Inc. to use drones to deliver commercial packages in Salt Lake City and Bentonville, Arkansas. These drones can fly beyond the operator's visual line of sight and will release the payload via parachute. The data collected from these operations will inform the FAA's ongoing policy and rulemaking activities. The FAA is working on developing standard rules to make beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations routine, scalable, and economically viable. They have also chartered the Beyond Visual Line of Sight Aviation Rulemaking Committee to provide safety recommendations. The FAA's long-term goal is to integrate drones into the National Airspace System and they are working on a plan for Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) in collaboration with NASA.

## 9. [Show HN: ElectricSQL, Postgres to SQLite active-active sync for local-first apps](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37584049)

**Total comment counts : 51**

### Summary

 ElectricSQL is a tool that allows developers to build reactive, real-time, and local-first applications directly on Postgres. It provides features such as row-level DDLX rules for controlling data access, the ability to elect tables for synchronization, and permission management using existing data models. ElectricSQL also offers dynamic partial replication between Postgres in the cloud and SQLite in the local app through the use of Shapes. Additionally, it allows binding real-time data to components with Live queries, supports local writes for immediate, reactive, replicated, and conflict-free updates, and brings the power of the Erlang VM to local-first software development. The tool enables instant responsiveness and consistent speed through local-first data access, keeps data in sync between users and devices with real-time multi-user replication, and solves connectivity and concurrency issues using CRDTs, Rich-CRDTs, and strong eventual consistency. It reduces backend workload by standardizing on a simple, scalable replication protocol and provides a cost reduction by moving data and compute workload to the local device. ElectricSQL is compatible with any Postgres-based system and supports existing data models, migration tooling, web frameworks, and component libraries. It is designed to be incrementally adopted, allowing for an easy transition from REST API endpoints and GraphQL layers. The tool is available under the Apache 2.0 license, utilizes permissive licensing, and encourages contributions through open development on GitHub and Discord. It is a horizontally scalable sync service with no complex infrastructure or durability requirements. Developers can refer to the Quickstart guide, Examples, and Usage and Integration guides for further assistance.
