**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 Researchers have identified two sophisticated malware toolsets developed by a nation-state hacking group potentially linked to Russia, known as GoldenJackal. These tools were designed to compromise air-gapped systems—devices isolated from the Internet to protect sensitive data. The first toolset was used in 2019 against a South Asian embassy in Belarus, followed by a different but related toolset targeting a European Union government organization in 2022.

The security firm ESET discovered these toolkits and noted that they share some components with malware previously documented by Kaspersky, implying a connection between the two groups. The hacks revealed that GoldenJackal is adept at bypassing the significant defenses air-gapping provides, requiring advanced skills and resources typically available only to state-sponsored entities.

The initial toolkit from 2019 had comprehensive capabilities, while the newer toolkit introduced in 2022 showcased greater modularity and flexibility, using various programming languages and specialized functions for different tasks. This evolution reflects the group's growing sophistication. The attack process involves initially infecting an Internet-connected device, compromising external drives, and eventually extracting sensitive data from air-gapped systems.

ESET also found indications of GoldenJackal's targeting interests shifting towards Europe, while Kaspersky had linked their earlier activity to Middle Eastern targets. There are hints tying GoldenJackal to the Russian hacking group Turla, particularly through similarities in their malware command protocols.

## 7. [Heart rate variability differs between smartwatch and clinical testing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41794528)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 A recent study from West Virginia University (WVU) reveals discrepancies in heart rate variability (HRV) measurements reported by consumer wearables, such as smartwatches and rings, compared to those recorded in clinical settings. Matt Tenan, a human performance researcher at WVU, explains that while wearables use photoplethysmography (PPG) to measure blood flow, clinical methods like electrocardiography (ECG) track the heart's electrical signals. This difference can lead to biased metrics, which impact overall health assessments, such as readiness and sleep scores generated by these devices.

The research involved a simulation analysis that demonstrated the variances in measurements, emphasizing that while wearables are useful, their accuracy differs from clinical assessments. The study also found that not all wearables are equal; Apple’s method for measuring HRV was identified as the most accurate, whereas other brands using the root mean square standard deviation (RMSSD) were less reliable.

Tenan hopes these findings will encourage manufacturers to adopt more accurate measurement methods and plans further research on consumer-grade wearables in clinical contexts. The full study was published in the journal Sports Medicine.

They criticize the statement about bias in measurements, arguing that it fails to clarify the extent or nature of the bias. The author believes the underlying message suggests the composite is inaccurate, but the lack of concrete evidence or definitive language undermines the argument.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Researchers have identified that Apple's method for measuring heart rate variability, known as standard deviation of normal-to-normal (SDNN), is more accurate compared to the root mean square standard deviation (RMSSD) used by other brands, which has a wider error range. This finding is notable for those who use Apple devices, as it reinforces confidence in their readings. It also highlights the significance of the small design decisions made by developers and designers, showcasing how these choices contribute to the overall effectiveness of a system.

## 8. [Washington's 'forgotten giant' volcano stirs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41791208)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Geologists are monitoring Mount Adams in Washington due to an unusual spike in seismic activity, with six minor earthquakes detected in September, a significant increase from the typical one earthquake every two to three years. This is the highest monthly quake count since 1982. Although this activity is being closely observed, it is not currently a cause for alarm, with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maintaining Mount Adams at its lowest alert level, indicating no imminent eruption. 

The USGS has received permission to install additional seismic monitoring stations to enhance data collection. While Mount Adams hasn't erupted in approximately 3,800 years, the volcano is classified as a "high-threat" due to potential hazards to nearby populations and infrastructure. Previous eruptions have primarily resulted in lava flows rather than explosive activity. The main risk associated with Mount Adams remains the possibility of lahars—flows of rock, ash, and ice—which can occur regardless of volcanic activity. Geologists stress that current seismic activity could simply be normal tremors and not indicative of an impending eruption.

## 10. [Eating less can lead to a longer life: study in mice shows why](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41826449)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 A recent study involving nearly 1,000 mice has challenged conventional beliefs about the relationship between calorie restriction, weight loss, and longevity. While cutting calories leads to weight loss and metabolic changes, the research indicates that factors such as immune health, genetics, and physiological resilience are more crucial for extending lifespan. The study revealed that the mice with the highest weight loss did not necessarily live longer, suggesting complex interactions beyond just metabolism influence longevity. These findings may shift how scientists approach dietary restriction studies in humans, highlighting that metabolic health and lifespan might not be directly correlated. The study was co-led by Gary Churchill and funded by Calico Life Sciences.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the topic of intermittent fasting and caloric restriction as methods for extending lifespan, specifically in mice. It highlights that while mice are commonly used in research due to their easy breeding and short lifespans, their relevance to humans is questionable. Furthermore, studies on caloric restriction in monkeys have not shown an increase in lifespan, raising doubts about its effectiveness for humans. The article references Peter Attia as a credible source on longevity science, noting his discussions on this subject from five years ago.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the ambiguous conclusions surrounding the effects of caloric restriction on longevity. While cutting calories significantly (by 40%) showed the greatest increase in lifespan, other approaches like intermittent fasting also improved lifespan and metabolic health without directly correlating weight loss with longevity. Notably, the mice that lost substantial weight tended to die younger than those with modest weight loss, indicating that factors beyond just metabolic changes influence lifespan. Key determinants for increased lifespan included traits linked to immune health and resilience, with the most resilient mice showing better longevity despite losing less weight. A clinical trial on low-calorie diets indicated short-term metabolic rate reduction, which may signal potential long-term benefits for lifespan. However, the findings suggest that more comprehensive metrics are needed to evaluate the true effectiveness of anti-aging strategies.
