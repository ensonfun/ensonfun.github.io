**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 This article is a letter from Lewis Carroll to the magazine Nature, dated March 31, 1887. In the letter, Carroll describes a method he devised for mentally calculating the day of the week for any given date. The method involves breaking the date into four parts (centuries, years, month, and day) and performing various calculations to determine the final result. Carroll provides examples to demonstrate the application of the method. The letter also mentions that the time taken to perform these calculations can vary depending on the individual's computational speed.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses different methods for quickly calculating the day of the week for a given date. The author mentions a method they use, which is similar to the one used by Art Benjamin. This method takes about 10 to 15 seconds and requires some practice and memorization. The author also mentions a different technique used by JH Conway, which they prefer for calculating days in the current year but find harder to use for other years. The article includes an example calculation and some additional information on mnemonic codes for each month and the computation process.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the difference between Old Style and New Style dates and what occurred in 1752. In England, the legal year used to begin on 25 March, known as Lady Day. This meant that there were cases where dates such as 24 March 1707 would be immediately followed by 25 March 1708, while the day after 31 December 1708 would be 1 January 1708. However, in 1752, the Calendar (New Style) Act was enacted, bringing about a change in the calendar system.

## 6. [Advancing Our Bet on Asymmetric Cryptography](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40457500)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 Google has enabled the latest Kyber draft specification for TLS 1.3 and QUIC on all desktop Chrome platforms to protect users from the risk of future quantum computers. This rollout uncovered bugs in several TLS middlebox products, and Chrome is offering a temporary enterprise policy to help with the deployment of fixes. Google's post-quantum strategy focuses on quantum-resistant key exchange in HTTPS and increased agility in certificates from the Web PKI. The goal is to prioritize deploying post-quantum cryptography in systems at risk of being compromised by quantum computers. Chrome's launch of Kyber, a hybrid post-quantum cryptographic key exchange, addresses the urgent threat of store-now-decrypt-later attacks. While migrating to post-quantum authentication is also important, it presents challenges due to the larger size of post-quantum cryptography. Google suggests focusing on enabling trust anchor agility to address the authentication requirements of HTTPS.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the need for agility in PKI deployment due to the introduction of potentially interesting variations of PQ (Post-Quantum) signatures and hybrids. It suggests using trust expressions consisting of a set of certificate indexes against a trust store database, instead of trust store versions and exclusion labels. In this model, a trust store is a centrally managed list where each certificate is assigned a unique 64-bit index. The server constructs or retrieves a trust chain from one of the listed roots and sends it to the client. Intermediate certificates can also be stored in the trust store database and cached on the client. This approach reduces complexity on the client side and shifts some work to the server. The client only needs to state which certificates it has and what algorithms it supports, and the server returns the shortest chain that the client can use as proof.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the likelihood of quantum computers breaking encryption technology that was developed in the year 2000. The author doubles down on their belief that no one reading the article will live to witness such an event.

## 7. [Forebruary](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40438894)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses a wall calendar called Forebruary, which does not need to be replaced every year. The calendar has a movable frame that can display the current month, and has a red stripe to highlight weekends. Alternative frames can be made for countries like the United States, where the week starts on Sunday.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author's fiancÃ©e compares weekdays to books and weekends to bookends. In the United States, where the week starts on Sunday, the weekends are considered a part of the weekend. The author's fiancÃ©e sees the weekdays as the middle of the week, while the weekends are the beginning and end. The analogy is similar to circling the ends of a line segment - there are two spots to circle. Although time has a beginning, the fiancÃ©e's logic is based on the idea of weekends as bookends.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes a minimalist wall calendar called Forebruary. The author highlights the impracticality of the calendar, as it only has space for a single month. They argue that in order to plan for multiple months, individuals would need to purchase multiple separate calendars. Furthermore, the article points out that the calendar offers no way to mark the current date and does not provide information about the number of days in each month. Overall, the article concludes that Forebruary is not a functional or practical calendar solution.

## 8. [300k airplanes in five years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40454136)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article discusses the significant role played by the United States in World War II through its enormous industrial output. Before entering the war, the U.S. provided equipment worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Allies. During the war, U.S. manufacturing output tripled, resulting in the production of numerous cargo ships, landing craft, trucks, machine guns, and ammunition. Aircraft production was particularly crucial, with the U.S. producing more airplanes than Germany, Japan, and Italy combined. The U.S. aircraft industry experienced a substantial transformation during the war, increasing its production capacity and adopting new methods of production. The growth of the industry was influenced by large orders placed by Britain and France before the U.S. entered the war. These orders rescued companies from bankruptcy and allowed them to expand their workforce. Overall, the U.S. aircraft industry played a vital role in the Allies' victory in World War II.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the fact that during World War I, the United States had to borrow rifles from France due to its lack of preparation. It points out that although people assume the US would quickly mobilize and respond after an attack, this was not the case in World War I. Unlike in World War II, the US did not become a major weapons manufacturing power overnight. The article suggests that if a conflict were to arise with China, it is not guaranteed that the US would experience the same rapid transformation as it did in World War II.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the level of government control and mobilization of the US economy during World War II. The author is amazed by how quickly factories were converted to produce war goods and highlights the minimal production of commercial cars during that period. The author questions whether such a high level of centralized government control would be possible in the present day, considering the potential challenges faced by the modern economy and supply chains.

## 9. [Regular expression functions in Excel](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40426720)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 Microsoft is introducing three new Excel functions that use Regular Expressions (regex) to parse text more easily. The functions are REGEXTEST, REGEXEXTRACT, and REGEXREPLACE. REGEXTEST checks if a pattern matches any part of the provided text, REGEXEXTRACT returns substrings that match the pattern, and REGEXREPLACE replaces substrings that match the pattern with a replacement string. These functions are currently in preview and their signature and results may change. There will also be a way to use regex within XLOOKUP and XMATCH in the future. Microsoft is seeking feedback from users on these new functions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the back-and-forth competition between Google Sheets and Excel. Google Sheets initially focused on compatibility but later introduced innovative features, which were quickly replicated by Excel. Some notable features include spill formulas (introduced by Google and adopted by Microsoft), # notation for spill formulas (only supported by Excel so far), regular expressions (introduced by Google and adopted by Excel), and check boxes (introduced by Google and adopted by Excel). The article suggests that this competitive dynamic will likely continue with both sides attempting to create unique extensions that cannot be replicated by the other.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the combination of Excel's production reliability with the clarity of regular expressions and the simplicity of matrix slices.
