## 4. [Using go fix to modernize Go code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47049479)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The Go 1.26 release revamps go fix with a suite of analyzers that automatically modernize code to leverage newer language features. The command can fix all packages under a directory, with -diff preview and per-build configuration support via GOARCH/GOOS. You can run specific analyzers with flags and apply fixes incrementally to ease code reviews. Generics and newer idioms enable simpler patterns (e.g., min/max, range-over-int, strings.Cut). Modernizers are integrated into gopls and go fix, enabling self-service guidelines for maintainers, and addressing AI training-data concerns for up-to-date idioms.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The comments praise Go's integrated tooling and AST-based refactoring (e.g., go fix) as a major productivity boost and argue this approach should guide future languages and training data to reflect the latest idioms.  
- Concern: A key worry is that LLMs will reproduce older coding idioms unless training data is updated to include the newest idioms.  
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic praise for tooling’s impact on language maturity and productivity, to personal ambivalence toward Go yet appreciation for the tooling, to optimism that other languages will imitate this model and adopt AST-aware rewrites over regex hacks.  
- Overall sentiment: Highly positive

## 5. [Physicists Make Electrons Flow Like Water](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47007117)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 Water and electricity flow differently: electrons typically move independently, unlike water’s cohesive flow. But theorists have long suspected electrons can behave as a fluid. Recent experiments, led by Cory Dean, show electrons forming fluid-like flows, including a dramatic high-speed shock wave, signaling collective motion. In a wire, collisions with impurities or phonons produce a dispersive flow, unlike water’s momentum-conserving collisions that create eddies. The Gurzhi effect predicted that momentum-conserving collisions could boost current when heated; decades later that idea gained traction. Hydrodynamic electron flow could inspire new devices and deepen quantum-material theory, a revival sparked by Geim’s 2004 work.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Advances in synthesizing pristine graphene are enabling scalable industrial use and fueling excitement about 2D materials.

- Perspectives: Views range from enthusiastic about synthetic graphene and industry deployment to acknowledging ongoing practical difficulties with 2D materials and joking about teaching approaches.
- Overall sentiment: Cautiously optimistic.

## 6. [So you want to build a tunnel](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47049718)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Grady, a civil engineer, highlights a growing hobby-tunneling scene—from Colin Furze’s underground link, Kala “Tunnel Girl,” and JerryRigEverything’s bunker chronicles, to Sandland and Cerro Gordo explorations—driven by the lure of underground spaces. He compares hobby builds to professional tunneling methods, noting safety and engineering challenges. Crucially, he cautions that rights and permits matter: land ownership is three‑dimensional, subsurface easements and building codes apply, and trespassing is illegal even underground. Before digging, secure permissions and study regulations; this is about learning, not free rein.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread debates the feasibility, safety, and media portrayal of underground tunnels/bunkers, interspersed with humor, personal anecdotes, and praise for experts.
- Concern: The main worry is that sensationalized coverage and amateur builds could promote unsafe engineering and misinformation about tunneling.
- Perspectives: Views range from criticizing sensationalism and safety gaps to supporting authentic engineering discussion and admiring experts like Engineer Kala, with added personal coping stories and memes.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [Async/Await on the GPU](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47049628)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 VectorWare announces that Rust's Future trait and async/await can be used on GPUs, enabling structured concurrency without committing to a new execution model. Traditional GPU programming relies on data parallelism, while warp specialization adds complex, explicit task-based parallelism that is hard to reason about due to manual concurrency and synchronization. Frameworks like JAX, Triton, and CUDA Tile offer high-level models around blocks/tiles but require new ecosystems and reduce code reuse. The article argues for a Rust-based abstraction that composes with existing CPU code, provides fine-grained control when needed, and uses a minimal Future interface to encapsulate asynchronous work on GPUs.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion explores applying async/await to GPU programming to coordinate warp-level work, comparing Rust futures with explicit models like stdexec, and weighing potential gains in mixed compute/memory pipelines against GPU-specific scheduling and memory constraints.
- Concern: This approach may introduce runtime bookkeeping and scheduling overhead, misalign with GPU execution, and risk performance loss or ecosystem fragmentation.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from cautious optimism about reducing boilerplate in mixed pipelines to sharp skepticism about performance, warp-wide state limits, SIMD constraints, and cross-architecture applicability.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 9. [Tesla 'Robotaxi' adds 5 more crashes in Austin in a month – 4x worse than humans](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47051546)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 Tesla reports five new Austin Robotaxi crashes in January 2026, totaling 14 since June 2025. One earlier crash was upgraded to hospitalization. All five new narratives are redacted; Tesla remains unique in hiding crash details. A July 2025 crash was upgraded to minor with hospitalization. With roughly 800,000 miles driven, the rate is about one crash per 57,000 miles—nearly 4× Tesla’s own human-driver benchmarks (minor every 229k; major 699k) and about 8× police averages (~1 per 500k). By contrast, Waymo has driven over 127 million fully driverless miles with significantly fewer injuries.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread debates whether Tesla's FSD robotaxi is safe and ready, citing inconsistent miles-to-incident data, the influence of safety drivers, and the need for transparent, independent reporting before broad deployment.
- Concern: The main worry is that the safety data and reporting are incomplete or biased, risking misleading the public and permitting insufficient regulatory scrutiny or action.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from strong skepticism and demands for independent crash narratives and oversight to calls for more miles and transparent data, with comparisons to rivals like Waymo and mentions of alternative transport options.
- Overall sentiment: Highly skeptical
