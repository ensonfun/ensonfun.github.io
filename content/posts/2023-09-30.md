## 5. [SIMH – Old Computer Emulator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37706210)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 SIMH is a free and open-source emulator that supports multiple platforms and systems. It was developed by Bob Supnik, a former DEC engineer, and has been in development since the 1960s. The purpose of SIMH is to preserve minicomputer hardware and software that was becoming obsolete. In May 2022, a contributor unilaterally modified the MIT License of SIMH version 4 on GitHub, making it non-free. This change led to Supnik withdrawing his endorsement of version 4 and only recognizing the "classic" version 3.x releases. On June 3, 2022, the Open SIMH group forked the last revision of SIMH not subject to the non-free clause, forming a new governance model with Supnik and others. The group cited a "situation" that compromised the project's principles. SIMH emulates hardware from various companies, and it is an emulation-related stub article on Wikipedia.

### Summary

 The article discusses the decline in descriptive images on event listings in London due to copyright trolls. The author explains that they have been fined for using images provided by event venues that didn't have permission or the proper license to use the photos. As a result, the author has decided to reduce the number of header images on events to avoid legal risks. The article also mentions that the website relies on advertising revenue, which is shrinking, and encourages readers to support the website through donations. The author concludes by addressing concerns about the legality of the fines and suggests using their own photos or specifying the source of the images to deal with copyright trolls.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author, a software engineer and photographer, shares their method of allowing others to benefit from their photography. They upload their pictures to Flickr and tag them with a Creative Commons license, making it easy for anyone to search and use their images without licensing fees, as long as they provide a link back to the original source. This practice has resulted in the author's photos appearing on platforms like Wikipedia, concert promotions, and even in a special edition of Monopoly. The author encourages like-minded individuals to consider using a Creative Commons license to make high-quality images more accessible to small publishers without legal concerns.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that photographers who use copyright enforcement services are ultimately harming themselves. The author claims that most people would not be willing to risk hefty fines for using a few images, and would instead opt for AI-generated content or not use images at all. The author suggests that if these enforcement services were fair, they would first offer options to remove or purchase a license for the image at a reasonable price, and only impose punitive fees if infringement continues.

## 10. [Encrypted Client Hello](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37703885)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 Cloudflare has announced a new standard called Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) that aims to improve privacy on the internet. ECH masks the Server Name Indication (SNI) used in TLS handshakes, preventing networks from snooping on which websites a user is visiting. By enabling ECH, only the user, Cloudflare, and the website owner will be able to determine which website was visited. This adds to Cloudflare's existing efforts to enhance privacy, such as DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and Oblivious DNS over HTTPS. ECH has been enabled for all free zones, and Cloudflare encourages website owners to enable the feature to protect user privacy. The company hopes that more providers will adopt ECH, leading to a more private internet for everyone.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) and compares it to Server Name Indication (SNI). While SNI includes the hostname in the connection initiation process, ECH encrypts the hostname within a section called ClientHelloInner. This encryption is done using a public key available over DNS. This prevents ISPs and governments from analyzing traffic. However, the article raises concerns about ECH implementation, as it could potentially limit governments' ability to block websites that violate their laws. It suggests that governments may resort to client-side blocklisting, DRMization, or blocking large portions of the internet as alternative measures. The article provides references to Cloudflare's explanation of ECH, as well as examples of government actions in France and Kazakhstan to support its arguments.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the contradiction in Cloudflare's claims about their Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) feature. While Cloudflare states that with ECH enabled, no one except the user and the website can determine which website was visited, the inner/outer SNI part reveals that Cloudflare can still see the actual server name the user is trying to visit. This contradicts their claim of complete privacy and seems more like a consolidation of traffic under the pretext of privacy.
