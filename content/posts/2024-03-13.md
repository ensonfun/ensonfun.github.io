## 1. [JIT WireGuard](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39688545)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article is about Fly.io, a company that uses WireGuard to make their system faster and more scalable. They have implemented WireGuard in unique ways, such as conjuring a TCP/IP stack for every instance of their CLI. However, they encountered two problems: unreliable message delivery with NATS and leftover WireGuard peers after running flyctl. To solve these issues, they decided to have gateways pull configurations from their API on demand instead of pushing them. They used the Netlink interface in the Linux kernel to create their own events for handling incoming connection attempts. By implementing these changes, they improved the reliability and performance of their system.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a problem with building a specific design using the Linux kernel WireGuard. The issue is that the WireGuard kernel does not have a feature to install peers on demand. The article suggests that it is possible to add peers at runtime, but the author seeks clarification on this. They mention that the desired step is to authenticate a peer before adding it to the interface to prevent stale entries. To achieve this, a solution involving an eBPF filter and cryptokey-routing is proposed, where the authorized counterpart is checked before adding the peer to the interface, and it is later removed after a timeout.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author agrees that a direct HTTP request for a single point-to-point message is more reliable than routing through a message queue. However, they express surprise that NATS, a messaging system, would lose many messages to the point where it affected their services. The author wonders why NATS wouldn't simply retry delivery until successful and asks if anyone knows the reason behind this perceived unreliability.

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 Bluesky, a social media platform that aims to give users control over their online experience, has announced that it is open-sourcing its collaborative moderation tool called Ozone. With Ozone, individuals and teams can work together to review and label content on the platform. Bluesky is also allowing users to run their own independent moderation services integrated into the Bluesky app, giving them more control over their social media experience. The platform has its own moderation team but recognizes the need for customization, so it is building an ecosystem of moderation and open-source safety tools. Users will have the option to subscribe to additional moderation services on top of what Bluesky provides. This hybrid approach aims to offer a cohesive experience with in-house moderation working alongside community-specific customization. Independent moderation services will give users and community builders the ability to further customize their spaces, and open APIs will allow developers to innovate on these systems. The platform is prioritizing a polished user experience with customization options.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a system called "Labels" which allows for the publishing of metadata on posts. Clients can choose which labeling services to use, and labels can be attached to responses. The system aims to do the majority of moderation at the community level. The labels can be neutral or negative and can function as user badges. The system will be extended to support richer metadata and behaviors in the future.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that getting incentives for moderation right is important. The author believes that users should have the ability to temporarily turn off moderation features to get an unfiltered view. Without this option, moderation can turn into censorship, especially in ideological contexts. Additionally, even if users have the ability to turn off moderation, it will still likely suppress content production as people may feel that their voice is not being heard. However, by enabling users to experiment with turning off moderation, they can assess whether the moderation is supportive or censoring. This can encourage moderators to be reasonable, as their actions are easily discoverable and measurable. The author also suggests that weak moderation, which is always consensual, is better for groups. This avoids leadership contests and allows group members' voices to be heard. Overall, weak moderation can make group membership more valuable and promote trust amongst members.

## 9. [A ragtag band of internet friends became the best at forecasting world events](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39685894)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article discusses a group called Samotsvety, which specializes in predicting the future. The group consists of highly accurate forecasters, and they were discussing the likelihood of China controlling at least half of Taiwan's territory by 2030. Each member of the group gives their estimate, ranging from 5% to 24%. The article explores why the Samotsvety group is so good at forecasting and what sets them apart from others. It also mentions that non-experts' aggregated opinions in forecasting have been found to be more accurate than the forecasts of experts. The article highlights the commitment of Samotsvety members to grading their own accuracy and their knowledge in geopolitical events and China-Taiwan relations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the process of estimating and predicting future events, with a focus on "base rates." It mentions that groups that utilize base rates tend to perform better in predicting competitions. The concept of base rates is explained as a way to understand the scale of numbers involved in events, even if individual methodologies may not be accurate on their own. Examples of base rates are given, such as the rate of provinces claimed by China being absorbed and the frequency of control changes in Taiwan. The article also mentions Laplace's rule, which states that the probability of something happening for the first time is 1 divided by N+2, where N represents the number of times it hasn't happened in the past. The author then averages three base rates to make an initial prediction of 8 percent for an event.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author raises a concern about the accuracy of predicting one-off events, such as China invading Taiwan or London being hit by a nuclear weapon, in terms of a percentage. They question how one can determine if the prediction was accurate since the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event does not validate or invalidate the percentage chance assigned to it. The author wonders if there is some form of aggregate that validates these predictions. They provide an example where an 8% chance of invasion does not indicate a wrong prediction if an invasion occurs; rather, it suggests that the world fell within that 8% likelihood.

## 10. [Multi-Threading and Mutation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39683059)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses the milestones that programmers need to reach in order to effectively write code and understand the underlying hardware. It emphasizes the importance of learning to write code that operates on batches of data and the significance of understanding memory allocation. The author also highlights the crucial milestone of writing code that can execute in parallel using multiple threads. The article suggests that it is better to build code with the constraints of multithreading in mind from the beginning, rather than trying to add it later. The author shares their own experience of initially finding multithreading intimidating but ultimately realizing that it can be made easier by designing systems with the additional constraints in mind. The article concludes by stating that the task of writing multithreaded systems is not just about synchronization, but also about minimizing the need for synchronization in order to achieve the benefits of parallel execution.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of Rust's borrow checker, which formalizes the usage of shared references and exclusive/mutable references in the language. The unsafe keyword and interior mutability pattern are mentioned as escape hatches for certain situations. The author expresses their appreciation for Rust's ability to prevent data races, highlighting that while other languages like Java may claim to be memory safe and type safe, they may still have issues with concurrency bugs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author learned multi-threaded programming on OS/2 in the late 80s and has since designed their code to handle multiple threads even if they thought only one would execute it. This approach has saved them rewrites when other threads were introduced. In their new data management system, multi-threading was designed into every component, resulting in a code that runs nearly twice as fast on CPUs with twice as many cores.
