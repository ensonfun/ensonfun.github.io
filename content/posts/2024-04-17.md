## 1. [Ten years of improvements in PostgreSQL's optimizer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40060123)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's investigation into the performance improvements of PostgreSQL's query optimizer over the last 10 years. The author ran the join order benchmark on PostgreSQL versions 8 through 16 and recorded the 90th percentile query latency for each version. The author found that PostgreSQL's tail performance has improved significantly, with the optimizer reducing tail latency by nearly half between version 8 and version 16. Regression analysis shows that each new major version of PostgreSQL brings an average 15% performance improvement on the benchmark. The article also acknowledges that improvements to the execution engine contribute to the overall performance enhancements. The author suggests further investigation into the changes in query plans over the years. Raw data is available for those interested, and the join order benchmark is a challenging set of queries with many joins.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses three points related to optimizing Postgres (a database management system): the need for better data on costs, the importance of deferred or alternative scenario planning, and the potential for using machine learning for cost discovery and estimation instead of planning. The author suggests that improvements can still be made in these areas.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that benchmarking the query optimizer by increasing the size of the shared buffers is flawed, as it only measures the speed of the query optimizer and join processor rather than the quality of the generated query plans. The author suggests that the generated plans for different versions of the system are likely the same, and the benchmark is only measuring execution speed.

## 2. [How many bathrooms have Neanderthals in the tile?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40063367)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 This article shares a Reddit post about a dentist who found an ancient jaw in their parent's new travertine flooring. The travertine was sourced in Turkey, and while other interesting fossils were discovered, the jaw was the most identifiable. The article then discusses how travertine, a type of limestone, often includes fossils of plants, animals, and even humans. It mentions various archaeological discoveries of hominin remains in travertine deposits, including stone tools and animal bones with cutmarks. The article also highlights specific examples, such as the Steinrinne site in Germany and the Kocaba≈ü skull in Turkey. The author explains that quarrying of travertine deposits for construction purposes often leads to these fossil discoveries. The article concludes by addressing the question of why such fossils are not noticed before travertine is installed in buildings, attributing it to the rough cutting and basic quality checks performed during the quarrying process.

The models are said to outperform other text-to-image generation systems and have improved text understanding and spelling capabilities. The article also mentions the partnership with Fireworks AI to deliver these models and ensure enterprise-grade service availability. Safety measures have been taken to prevent misuse of Stable Diffusion 3. The goal is to provide adaptable solutions that enable creativity and activate human potential.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the release of models, which are free to use for non-commercial projects. However, a $20 per month subscription is required for projects with less than $1 million in annual revenue or less than 1 million users. There is an "undisclosed" enterprise subscription needed for projects larger than the aforementioned criteria. The author finds the $240 per year price for smaller commercial projects appealing, but expresses concern about the undisclosed enterprise pricing, as it could potentially be used to tax companies that compete with the API. As a result, the author suggests that this technology may only be viable for small companies.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author came across a discussion about whether Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) will fully replace SD 1.5 and SDXL or if there will still be trade-offs for different uses. They mention that stability measures in SD3 are causing thousands of artists to be excluded for "safety" reasons, resulting in billions of images not making the cut. The author wonders how much SD3 will be limited in terms of nudity, artist names, and other issues, and if these problems can be resolved with adjustments. They share that they don't have access to SD3 yet but have compiled a list of all the SD3 generations from Twitter using their premium API and made it searchable. They provide a link to the compiled information.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the power dynamics between democracies and totalitarian regimes have led to an inevitable outcome. Democracies initially believed that the internet would help dismantle totalitarianism through the free flow of information. However, they overlooked the fact that totalitarian regimes can control information by imprisoning or eliminating those who access and spread it. Now, these regimes are utilizing AI and shill farms to generate propaganda and destabilize democracies at a relatively low cost. As a result, the author argues that we are all heading towards a global race to the bottom, and the ideals of the early internet have been crushed due to human evil.

The article also includes a side story about fixing a bug in Windows 95 related to the use of the Ctrl+C hotkey conflicting with a video game.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) in Australia. This tax applies to non-cash benefits provided by employers to employees. The FBT is calculated at the maximum marginal income tax rate, currently 47%, on a "grossed up" value of the benefit, which is currently 2.08. For example, a $1000 benefit is grossed up to $2080 and then taxed at 47%, resulting in an FBT of $977.60. Employers can deduct the cost of the benefit and the FBT from their company's income as an expense. The article also mentions exemptions for events like Christmas parties and allowable travel expenditure. The FBT is designed to discourage employers from providing non-cash benefits to employees and encourage cash payments instead.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that tax agencies do not typically target air miles and other points schemes that are designed to waste company funds. This allows individuals to profit tax-free. In light of this, the author believes that tax agencies likely have little concern about engineers being allowed to keep loaner copies of software used for testing purposes.
