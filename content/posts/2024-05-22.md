### Summary

 This article provides advice on how to learn Common Lisp in the present day. The author emphasizes that Common Lisp has a long history and recommends understanding its background before diving into learning the language. They explain the process of standardizing Common Lisp in the 1980s and highlight that the ANSI specification published in 1995 is still in use today. The author also mentions that Common Lisp is a stable, large, practical, extensible, and sometimes considered an ugly language. They caution that, unlike many modern languages, upgrading implementations and libraries in Common Lisp may not break existing code. The article concludes by suggesting that having this understanding will help learners navigate the language effectively.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article struggled to use Common Lisp because they are a Vim user. They found that using plugins to simulate the SLIME EMacs REPL was not ideal and limited the interactive development experience. The author believes that being tied to EMacs or an enterprise solution like LispWorks is not a viable option for many developers. They express a desire for an alternative Common Lisp development experience that can work in a wider range of text editors and IDEs. The author acknowledges that there is a lot to learn from Common Lisp but believes it can be difficult for most developers to access.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of using a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) in programming languages, specifically focusing on Lisp. The author mentions that a REPL is often considered a great feature of Lisp because it allows for an interactive development style. The author, who is only experienced in interpreted languages like R and Ruby, admits to not fully understanding why a REPL is so highly regarded since it seems like a standard feature to them. They speculate that the convenience and immediate execution offered by a REPL may be more appreciated by programmers who work in compiled languages.

## 7. [Designed to Crash: the story of Antonov An-28 HA-LAJ and its demise](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40434874)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 On August 28, 1993, a Soviet-designed Antonov An-28 twin turboprop airplane crashed in Oxfordshire, England. The plane had been chartered by a Royal Air Force parachuting club and had two Russian pilots and 17 parachutists on board. Shortly after takeoff, both engines failed when the crew attempted to retract the flaps. The captain managed to crash land the plane safely, saving everyone on board. The incident gave Britain's Air Accident Investigation Branch the opportunity to investigate the crash of a Soviet aircraft on British soil. The investigation revealed a series of events that led to the plane's modification for parachuting, its dual registration in two countries, and an electrical fault that caused the crash. The investigation also raised questions about the design process and post-Cold War opinions on Soviet aircraft. RAF Weston-on-the-Green, where the crash occurred, is a grass airstrip used by the Parachute Training School and the Royal Air Force Sports Parachuting Association. The club hired Avia Special Ltd. to find an aircraft that could meet their requirements, leading them to the Antonov An-28 owned by G92 Commerce in Hungary. The An-28 is a twin turboprop airplane capable of carrying passengers or cargo. Its origins date back to the 1960s, and mass production began in 1983. The specific An-28 involved in the crash was built in 1988 and registered under the Soviet state aviation company Aeroflot.

They also note the landing site's proximity to busy roads. The author jokingly mentions their initial skepticism about flying in a second-hand Soviet turboprop plane.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the concept of a propeller turning in reverse due to the angle of the blades, which causes the oncoming air to drive the propeller in reverse. However, the author clarifies that a propeller that is unfeathered will continue to rotate in the correct direction, with only the flow of torque being reversed. The article also mentions the possibility of the propeller exceeding its designed speed, resulting in the propeller tips becoming supersonic and introducing additional issues and risks.

## 8. [Counted B-Trees (2017)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40414187)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 This article discusses B-trees, which are algorithms used to store and retrieve sorted lists of items efficiently. The article introduces a small enhancement to the B-tree algorithm that allows for lookups based on numeric position in addition to key value. This enhancement enables finding arbitrary ordering statistics or stepping through the tree by a fixed number of items. Furthermore, this enhancement allows for constructing an unsorted B-tree, similar to an array, with efficient insertion and deletion of items. The article describes the structure of a B-tree and explains how the enhancement works by storing a count of elements in each subtree. It also provides a step-by-step explanation of how to look up the i-th element in the tree using this enhanced B-tree algorithm.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the motivation behind using a data structure called a counted B-tree for efficiently deleting old data, inserting new data, and querying quantiles over moving data windows, particularly in the context of time series. The author explains that using a counted B-tree is a robust solution that allows for the calculation of multiple quantiles over large data windows, and it is much more efficient than other naive solutions. The article also mentions that in the case of many duplicate keys, the same general framework can be used to handle it. Additionally, if the dynamic range of the data is known, more approximate dynamic quantiles can be obtained using a histogram with log/exp-spaced bins and counters backed by a Fenwick Tree. The article provides a link to a fully worked example in Nim for reference.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the order statistic tree, which is covered in the book "CLRS" in the chapter on "Augmenting Data Structures" and the subchapter on "Dynamic order statistics." The article also mentions the implementation of a tree-based list data structure without set functionality. There is a link to the implementation provided.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author praises the inclusion of known pieces in the article, particularly a Bach piece that they clicked on to watch. They mention how the visualization of the music allowed them to appreciate the counterpoint rhythm in a new way. Unlike other visualizers that have a moving object to represent tones, this visualization solely focuses on isolating the tones. The author enjoyed how this enhanced their appreciation of Bach's rhythmic counterpoint, noting that they could see when multiple strings were played simultaneously through clear purple coloring.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that with increasing levels of automation, low-skilled labor will become less valuable. As a result, most people will have little economic utility unless they receive subsidies or implement Universal Basic Income (UBI). The article refutes the idea that AI and automation will benefit the masses, stating that the economic value of the average person will be close to zero. The author suggests that we need to separate the notion of a person's value from their economic potential.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains how the current system works, in which the government subsidizes low-wage work by corporations. This system is seen as virtuous by many, as it prevents competition and satisfies shareholders. It also ensures a minimum level of care for workers, who would otherwise be replaced at higher rates. However, the article questions whether it would be fair for companies to bear more of the burden, acknowledging that words about justice are easy, but wielding power is costly.
