## 10. [Whippet GC notes on Guile, heuristics, and heap growth](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44061072)

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 The author successfully integrated Guile with a Nofl-based collector that scans edges conservatively. While the transition proved straightforward, they encountered issues related to heap sizing heuristics. Guile currently uses a growable heap policy, but fragmentation emerged as a significant problem, leading to allocation failures despite sufficient heap size. The author notes that simply increasing the heap size multiplier is not a viable solution due to the unsustainable multipliers required to prevent fragmentation. They conclude that to ensure reliability, an evacuation strategy must be implemented to manage fragmentation effectively.
