## 4. [Python's new t-strings](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43748512)

**Total comment counts : 42**

### Summary

 Template strings (t-strings) have been accepted in Python 3.14, set to be released in late 2025. They enhance string processing safety and flexibility, addressing pitfalls of f-strings, which risk SQL injection and cross-site scripting when misused with user input. T-strings, unlike f-strings, evaluate to a Template type, requiring processing to be safely combined into strings. They enable developers to access string components before finalization, allowing for versatile interpolation and safer dynamic content handling. This feature promises significant improvements in libraries and frameworks that manage user input, and developer tools are expected to adapt accordingly.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the need for tooling support for template strings (t-strings) in programming, emphasizing their potential to contain content like HTML or SQL. However, it points out that the type of content within t-strings cannot be inferred automatically, as their current design doesn't indicate their final output type. The conversion to valid SQL or other formats relies solely on the converting function, meaning there's no assurance that the template will produce valid SQL before processing. Critics argue that a more definitive syntax for indicating content type could enhance usability.
