## 1. [Signal Secure Backups](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45170515)

**Total comment counts : 51**

### Summary

 Signal is rolling out secure backups (opt-in) in Android beta to restore chats if a phone is lost. Backups are end-to-end encrypted with a 64-character recovery key you must keep; Signal cannot recover it. Free tier backs up all texts and last 45 days of media; a $1.99/month paid plan adds longer media/history. Backups refresh daily and aren’t linked to accounts or payments. Deleted or disappearing messages within the last 24 hours aren’t included. The feature will expand to iOS/Desk and enable cross-platform transfer in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Signal’s reliability for crucial conversations is in question, ranging from personal uses (family photos, messages, documents) to high-stakes coordination (Joint Chiefs). The piece suggests the team faced an unexpected, perhaps amusing, surprise in this context.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The post asks if Signal can use a separate app lock/PIN independent of the phone’s lock. It notes Threema has this feature and would prevent others from opening chats if the phone is handed over or lent for backup. As of the last check, Signal on Android cannot do this.

## 2. [NPM debug and chalk packages compromised](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45169657)

**Total comment counts : 58**

### Summary

 Starting Sept 8, 13:16 UTC, Aikido flagged 18 popular npm packages (over 2B weekly downloads) updated with malicious client-side code. The malware intercepts crypto/web3 activity, rewrites payment destinations and approvals to attacker-controlled accounts, and hides changes via obfuscation and string-matching. It hooks into fetch, XMLHttpRequest, and wallet interfaces to tamper with requests and responses across multiple layers. The maintainer was phished via a support email (domain registered Sept 5, 2025) and is cleaning up. Some packages (e.g., simple-swizzle, proto-tinker-wc) remain compromised. Aikido offers tools to detect and triage fixes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Someone reveals they were compromised in a targeted attack on npm packages. They warn that multiple packages were affected, including ansi-styles 6.2.2, debug 4.4.2 (yanked), chalk 5.6.1, supports-color 10.2.1, strip-ansi 7.1.1, ansi-regex 6.2.1, wrap-ansi 9.0.1, color-convert 3.1.1, color-name 2.0.1, and others. Chalk has already been published over, but the rest remain compromised. The attacker used a phishing email from npmjs.help; the author clicked the link on mobile and now cannot access their NPM account. Updates will be posted on the debug-js issue. The user apologizes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Some malware payload doesn’t randomly replace a wallet address; it computes Levenshtein distances between the legitimate address and each address in its list, then selects the attacker’s address that looks most similar. This social-engineering tactic targets users who only verify the first and last characters. The payload was deobfuscated and analyzed in detail, with a write-up available at jdstaerk.substack.com. Stay safe.

## 3. [Experimenting with Local LLMs on macOS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45168953)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 This post argues LLMs are not minds but powerful next-word predictors with some emergent behavior. The author—skeptical yet hands-on—uses them locally on macOS for summarization, routine advice, and journaling, while cautioning against anthropomorphism and hallucinations. They privacy- and ethics-focused, criticizing AI companies and preferring open-weight models. For macOS, two local paths exist: an open-source option by Georgi Gerganov (install via Nix, run Gemma 3 4B QAT) with a minimal web UI at http://127.0.0.1:8080, highlighting a hands-on approach over cloud use.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Using 'emergent' to describe current AI capabilities is concerning and likely exaggerated. Depending on perspective, it may seem emergent, but similar progress could be seen with more complex Markov chaining under resource constraints. What we observe is another step in predicting the next token from preceding words. Linguistics aims for efficient, lossless data transfer. While impressive, these models should not be treated as sentient or near human intelligence, or as spell-checkers; humans aren’t simple heuristics, and equating machines with sentience will mislead and disappoint.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece notes it’s impressive that a ~10GB model can run locally to summarize text, answer questions, and reason. However, model size must balance RAM; on a 16GB machine, roughly 12B–20B parameters is the practical ceiling before slowing down. The models run on the GPU via Metal rather than Apple’s Neural Engine, as Core ML isn’t well-suited for custom runtimes and low-level ANE access isn’t provided. Memory bandwidth and SRAM pose additional limits. The author hopes Core ML will be optimized to map transformers to the ANE.

## 4. [YouTube views are down (don't panic)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45173455)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 Several YouTube creators noticed a substantial drop in view counts in early August, affecting long-form videos across channels like Jeff Geerling’s. Despite stable likes and revenue per view, the overall view-to-like ratio fell, hinting at a change in how views are counted rather than waning interest. Dan Besser of LTT analyzed data from multiple channels and found a consistent, significant shift coinciding with August. Theories range from a new algorithmic A/B test separating engaged views from total views to a bug. The shift threatens sponsorships tied to views, even as creators explore other revenue streams.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author questions whether YouTube’s behavior can inflate view counts. They note that videos sometimes start playing silently from mobile search results without the user selecting them, yet still appear in their history. They also ask whether very short plays (under 10 seconds) are counted as views for longer videos.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece argues YouTube is cracking down on ad blockers by degrading non-paying users’ experiences, using tactics like fake interruptions at playback start, random mid-play errors, and removing hover-to-play on web and in-app. The author notes this pushes them to read more, though it likely hurts view counts.

## 5. [Will Amazon S3 Vectors kill vector databases or save them?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45169624)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 Amazon S3 Vectors is a hosted vector storage and query solution on S3, offering low-cost integration. The author argues it won’t kill dedicated vector DBs (Milvus, Pinecone, Qdrant) but will complement them within AWS. Vector search remains expensive: retrieval can dwarf LLM costs. The rise of embeddings and RAG drove data growth, latency shifts, and cost pressures, forcing a shift from memory to disk and now to object storage. Milvus/Zilliz describe three phases—memory era, disk-index revolution, and tiered storage with hot/cold separation—where S3 Vectors acts as a cost-efficient ally, not a replacement.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is balanced despite the author competing with Amazon S3. It praises reverse-engineering S3 Vectors, noting that filtering happens after coarse retrieval—keeping the index simple but hampering complex conditions. In tests, deleting 50% of data caused TopK-20 queries to return only 15 results, signaling a post-filter pipeline. The piece advocates for more transparent Amazon documentation rather than leaving such details to the development community.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is the founder and maintainer of the Milvus project and a fan of AWS S3, Lambda, and Aurora. They don’t regard S3Vector as one of the best S3 ecosystem products, but praise its latency control. It’s not particularly fast or feature-rich, yet it embodies S3’s "good enough" philosophy for certain use cases. Beyond Milvus, they’ve contributed to HBase and Oracle products and hope more people explore S3Vector’s underlying implementation, believing such discussions could benefit the search and storage communities and spur growth.

## 6. [Chat Control Must Be Stopped](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45173277)

**Total comment counts : 0**

### Summary

 The article warns the EU is reviving “Chat Control” as the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (CSAR), mandating mandatory scanning of all communications and files—even end-to-end encrypted data—by providers and reporting findings to police. It argues this would invade daily privacy, be unreliable, and erode privacy, civil liberties, and human rights, potentially worsening child safety. The European Council aims for a decision by Sept 12, 2025. Europeans are urged to contact their MEPs to oppose CSAR, though the proposal could affect everyone worldwide.

## 7. [How RSS beat Microsoft](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45166750)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Rather than the familiar Betamax/VHS tale, VHS won due to lower cost, longer recording, and openness despite Betamax’s higher fidelity. Similarly, RSS triumphed over ICE in content syndication—ICE, the Betamax to RSS’s VHS—because it was less open and more expensive, backed by Microsoft, Adobe, Reuters, and others. ICE collapsed as bloggers flooded the market with RSS feeds. By 1999–2000, RSS spread through grassroots desktop and web aggregators (Headline Viewer, my.userland), while Netscape abandoned its ICE-aligned path, and Dave Winer pushed his own RSS version.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 RSS may not be ideal for publishers, but it’s a dream for readers and a powerful open-web feature. The author notes a subscriber who canceled the email newsletter but chose the RSS feed instead. Thanks to Buttondown, the newsletter offers an RSS feed, which the author respects for its consumer-first design. While it’s tempting to value email addresses in a database, RSS consistently wins as a user-friendly, open-web delivery method.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 RSS is essential for the author: some major platforms still offer RSS, which keeps them using those services (they avoid Twitter because it lacks RSS). Without RSS, they wouldn’t use Reddit. The moment a platform drops RSS, they drop the platform. They also share their own RSS reader project on GitHub: rumca-js/Django-link-archive.

## 8. [Job mismatch and early career success](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45169892)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 Using US Air Force data on new enlistees across 130+ jobs, the authors address endogeneity by simulating job assignments from factors outside an individual's control—training-slot availability and incoming recruit quality—creating quasi-random variation in job cognitive demand relative to ability. They find that being overqualified increases attrition during training and in the field, causes more behavioral problems and worse general knowledge tests, but boosts job-specific performance within the same job and likelihood of promotion. Underqualified individuals show the opposite: higher effort but poorer relative performance. Overqualification clusters in lower outside-earnings jobs; underqualification in higher-value ones.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Findings show that overqualified workers are less motivated yet still outperform peers in the same job; underqualified workers are more motivated but struggle to compete when judged against others. The system appears to work, but only within the narrow, Air Force–specific testing context.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Despite years of skill–role misalignment, the author found they could complete most tasks in half the time. The extra time enabled them to launch successful businesses and build a thriving consulting career.

## 9. [Immich – High performance self-hosted photo and video management](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45165684)

**Total comment counts : 38**

### Summary

 Immich is a high-performance, self-hosted photo and video management solution. The page highlights documentation and installation guides at immich.app and provides a demo at demo.immich.app (including a mobile endpoint URL). It notes translations and language support. The content includes repeated “There was an error while loading. Please reload this page” messages.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece argues that the software’s supply chain is fragile due to frequent dependency bumps (every few days), making long‑term deployment risky. The author wants to use the project only after dependencies are matured and Debian-packaged, which they doubt will happen soon. They value stable deployments with years of maintenance limited to security updates; however, constant dependency churn and Docker Compose undermine that confidence. They cite a Hacker News item for further justification. While Debian isn’t immune, fewer moving parts make successful, persistent deployments easier than with ongoing dependency churn.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 A user praises Immich after the Beta Timeline release, noting prior Android performance issues and iPhone sync problems. With the beta, the app is now “basically perfect” after months of use, and a first-class CLI enables automation, such as creating albums from a Signal backup. They thank the Immich team.

## 10. [The key points of "Working Effectively with Legacy Code"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45138695)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Feathers’ Legacy Code defines it as code without tests and treats his book as a reference. The core challenge is preserving behavior; automated tests give safety to change. The paradox is you need tests to improve code, but you must refactor minimally to make tests possible. Often dependencies block testing, so you break them with seams—places to alter behavior without changing source, e.g., by extending a class in tests. Clarify what counts as a unit test (Feathers distinguishes not-unit tests). When understanding is hard, use characterization/snapshot/approval testing to capture current behavior and prevent regressions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 User reports that blockquotes render as black on black across Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. The issue seems caused by a CSS file named ai-support.D3anziw5.css from understandlegacycode.com. They humorously suggest the filename hints that much of the text could be written by multiple AI autocompleters in a trenchcoat.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece laments that, despite Martin Fowler’s influential Refactoring and its promise to fix flawed software, the practical value is often ignored. While the book offered a named, actionable approach, many stakeholders now view the term 'refactor' as a cue to waste time, undermining the effort to improve code.
