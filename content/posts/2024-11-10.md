## 1. [Audio Decomposition – open-source seperation of music to constituent instruments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42098491)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The project described aims to convert music audio files into sheet music by employing several signal processing techniques:

1. **Data Source**: The project uses instrument samples from the University of Iowa Electronic Music Studios database.

2. **Fourier Transform and Envelope Extraction**: The core of the method involves analyzing the music through Fourier transforms to identify the frequencies present (spectrogram approach) and extracting the envelope of the sound wave to characterize the dynamics of the instruments. The Fourier transform of each instrument is stored and used to reconstruct the music's frequency content at different time windows.

3. **Instrument Identification**: By comparing the Fourier transforms, the program attempts to determine which instruments are playing at any given moment. This is done by solving a matrix derived from minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the actual music and a sum of stored instrument Fourier transforms.

4. **Envelope Analysis**: The envelope of each note is segmented into attack, sustain, and release phases to understand how the sound evolves over time. This includes:
   - Identifying static vs. dynamic decay patterns.
   - Classifying whether the note has a distinct release phase.

5. **Note Detection**: The music file is processed through bandpass filters for each possible note frequency, followed by cross-correlation with instrument-specific attack and release phases to pinpoint note starts and ends. The MSE between the filtered audio and each instrument’s wave helps in determining the presence and intensity of each instrument at different times.

6. **Output**: Instead of recreating the audio, the project focuses on visualizing the music as sheet music using matplotlib's scatter plot to represent notes.

7. **Challenges**: Initial attempts to reconstruct the audio from the processed data faced significant issues, leading to a pivot towards visualization rather than audio synthesis. 

Overall, the project leverages signal processing to analyze and interpret musical audio, aiming to identify notes and instruments to generate a visual representation of the music as sheet music. However, due to technical challenges, the focus shifted from audio recreation to visualization.

## 10. [Hard Cases for a Handle Theory](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42070630)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of "handles" in everyday objects, using the example of chalk to illustrate how handles can be both integral and yet distinctly separate from the object itself. Here are the key points:

1. **Chalk as an Example**: Chalk, which does not have a traditional handle, becomes a metaphor for objects where the handle is part of the object itself, only becoming apparent when it is no longer useful for its primary function (i.e., writing). The remaining stub of chalk after use represents a "handle" that can't be used for its intended purpose anymore but still exists.

2. **Handles and Their Functions**: The piece explores how handles serve to manipulate or interact with objects. Handles must be grip-able, facilitating the transfer of force from the hand to the object. This leads to a discussion on what constitutes a handle, contrasting objects like sand or the sea, which inherently lack handles, with items like hammers, where the handle is clearly defined and functional.

3. **Philosophical Insight**: The text touches on philosophical undertones, referencing Martin Heidegger's concept of tools being "ready-to-hand" (zuhanden), where the tool (and by extension, the handle) becomes almost invisible during use, merging with the action it facilitates.

4. **Examples and Exceptions**: The author distinguishes between objects that are entirely handle-like (e.g., a baseball or sandwich) and those where the handle is distinct and serves a specific purpose. Objects like houses or cars might present accidental or makeshift handles, but these do not define the object's primary interaction method.

5. **Handle's Role in Life**: The narrative suggests handles are not just physical but symbolic of life's interactions, representing how we grasp and manage various aspects of our existence, often only recognizing their utility or lack thereof in retrospect or when they fail.

6. **Conclusion**: The piece concludes by questioning the nature of the relationship between a handle and the object it serves, suggesting handles are secondary and often overlooked, yet crucial in our interaction with the world. 

The article uses these reflections to delve into broader existential and phenomenological themes, using the mundane example of chalk to explore deeper philosophical inquiries about utility, interaction, and perception in everyday life.
