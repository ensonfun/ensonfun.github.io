## 1. [Title drops in movies](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42056923)

**Total comment counts : 55**

### Summary

 The article by Dominikus Baur and Alice Thudt explores the phenomenon known as the "title drop" in films, where a character mentions the movie's title during dialogue. Here's a summary of the key points:

- **Analysis Scope**: The study analyzed 73,921 movies from 1940 to 2023, covering about 61% of IMDb movies with at least 100 user votes.

- **Methodology**: The researchers used subtitles from OpenSubtitles.com and metadata from IMDb. They faced challenges in defining what constitutes a title drop, especially with common or sequel titles, leading to the implementation of specific rules for title recognition.

- **Findings**: 
  - About 36.5% of the movies analyzed contain at least one title drop, with an average of 10.3 title drops per movie that does include one.
  - The movie with the most title drops in fiction is "Barbie" (2023) directed by Greta Gerwig, with 267 mentions. For documentaries, "Mickey: The Story of a Mouse" tops the list with 309 drops.

- **Cultural Impact**: The article touches on the meta-nature of title drops and questions whether there's a correlation between the frequency of title drops and the film's quality or cultural trends.

- **Data Visualization**: The authors provide interactive visualizations for readers to explore the data further, indicating the depth and detail of their research.

Overall, the article provides a comprehensive look at title drops in cinema, exploring not just the frequency but also the implications and cultural significance of this practice in modern filmmaking.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the title "Neon Genesis Evangelion," a famous Japanese anime series from 1995. It explains that the English title includes "Neon Genesis," which isn't directly translated from the original Japanese title, "Shin-seiki Evangelion" (meaning "Evangelion of a New Era/Century"). The article notes that while these translations were approved by the creators, the intention behind the choice of "Neon Genesis" was unclear. However, in the final movie of the "Rebuild of Evangelion" series, the term "neon genesis" is explicitly mentioned by the protagonist, providing a satisfying explanation for fans and connecting back to the series' title, which was a delightful moment for the author in the theater.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's critique of how titles are considered in some analyses or data collections, specifically arguing that using titles like "It" or the name of a character (e.g., "Barbie") as title drops is not meaningful. The author believes this practice skews results and diminishes the value of the analysis, likening it to developers who manipulate the definition of a problem to avoid providing a substantial solution. This issue led the author to stop reading the analysis in question.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a growing divide in global economic strategies:

1. **Protectionist Camp**: Some countries are moving towards isolationism or forming mini-empires, focusing on self-sufficiency by heavily promoting exports while minimizing imports through high tariffs. This approach essentially aims to make their economies function like "trapdoor functions," where benefits are maximized internally, and external economic interactions are minimized.

2. **Globalization Advocates**: On the other side, there are nations for whom globalization is crucial. Their economies are so intertwined with global markets that without international trade, their economic systems would collapse. This dependency on global trade mirrors the economic conditions before World War II, suggesting a historical parallel where global economic integration was vital for survival.

 The article discusses the misunderstanding of economic concepts like inflation, which is the rate of change in prices rather than the price levels themselves. It critiques the Democratic Party's economic messaging and policy impacts over the last 40 years, which have not resonated well with voters in Ohio, leading to the state's political shift from being a bellwether to a reliably Republican state. This shift has had political consequences, notably contributing to the defeat of a pro-union Senator, Sherrod Brown.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a project by a user who created a set of classic stylesheets for various old operating systems including Windows 3.11, 95, 2000, XP, CDE, and Mac OS 9. The focus of this project was not on achieving pixel-perfect replicas but rather on adapting these classic interfaces to look aesthetically pleasing on modern systems with higher resolution displays. To achieve this, the user recreated icons and symbols in SVG format. Although the project was shared on a platform (likely Hacker News, given the mention of "Show HN"), it did not receive much attention, possibly due to an unappealing project title.

## 9. [Tracker Beeper (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42057036)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 Bert Hubert has developed a tool that makes a beeping sound each time a user's computer sends data to Google, highlighting the extent to which websites track users without their explicit consent. Initially focused on Google, the tool was expanded to include trackers like Facebook after a video demonstration of this tracking on the Dutch government's job site went viral, receiving a million views. The tool currently requires technical know-how to set up and is aimed at users of Linux, OSX, and BSD systems. Hubert's future plans include creating a live demo setup where phones on a specific WiFi network would trigger loud speakers to make noise for each tracker detected, potentially using different speakers for different trackers to visually and audibly demonstrate the prevalence of tracking. He is open to collaboration to bring this concept to life using simple hardware like a Raspberry Pi.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the evolution of defibrillators, focusing on the changes in external defibrillators over the past 35 years. It notes that while the energy level of these devices has been reduced from 300J to 200J, the primary advancement has been in the application method, moving from using gel to gel pads. This change helps prevent burns and reduces unpleasant odors, which were issues when using traditional gel. The author humorously reflects on past experiences with these devices, including the sensory challenges in ambulances where smoking was once permitted, and contrasts the manual reading of heart traces in the past with today's automated systems.
