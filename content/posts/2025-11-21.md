## 2. [Helping Valve to power up Steam devices](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46006616)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Valve unveiled three devices—Steam Frame (ARM-based), Steam Machine, and Steam Controller—and Igalia is helping power them with SteamOS. To run x86 PC games on ARM, Igalia contributed the FEX translation layer. The Frame’s Adreno 750 GPU required a robust Vulkan driver, which Igalia’s Mesa3D Turnip provides, adding Adreno 700-series support and tiled rendering. They worked with Valve, Google and others to improve Vulkan extensions and compatibility through DXVK, vkd3d-proton, and Zink, often with better correctness or speed than proprietary drivers. Valve’s open-source approach benefits the broader community; shader work by Job Noorman is noted.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on Valve and Igalia's open-source Mesa3D Turnip Vulkan driver for Qualcomm Adreno GPUs and its implications for ARM-based handhelds like a potential Steam Deck 2.
- Concern: Valve and Igalia may have ignored existing scheduling work (Bazzite/BORE), risking reinventing the wheel and missing an opportunity to leverage proven solutions.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic praise of openness and potential handheld efficiency to skepticism about duplicating work and a desire to reuse existing schedulers, plus excitement about future compatibility layers and 3D rendering of 2D games.
- Overall sentiment: Cautiously optimistic

## 3. [You can make PS2 games in JavaScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46006082)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Summary: You can run JavaScript games on PS2 via AthenaEnv, an open-source environment that embeds QuickJS and provides a JS API for rendering, assets, input, file I/O, and sound. It acts as a PS2-native program that executes JS through QuickJS. The author explored porting a Sonic Infinite Runner to PS2 using Athena, then tested it with PCSX2 by enabling host filesystem and launching athena.elf from the releases zip (which includes assets, main.js, athena.ini, and src). The Athena readme is in English, despite the Sonic port’s Portuguese Readme.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: AthenaEnv uses QuickJS to run JavaScript on the PS2, reviving homebrew and prompting discussion about modern JS game development and publishing on consoles without JITs.  
- Concern: The main worry is that NDA-bound console SDKs and JIT bans block using mainstream runtimes (like V8 or Electron) to publish JavaScript games on Switch/PS5/Xbox.  
- Perspectives: Opinions range from enthusiastic excitement about the tech and possibilities to skeptical doubts about feasibility given NDA constraints and JIT restrictions, with notes that the topic has been posted before.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 4. [We Remain Alive Also in a Dead Internet](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46008788)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 The piece argues that AI already shapes our lives far faster than we realize, with digital algorithms regulating our choices. Our fear isn’t of AI as an “other,” but of machines that mimic us too well. It highlights an In-itself vs. For-itself tension: AI’s creative potential may be incompatible with human minds, though many deny this and engage with AI without restraint. The trend toward bot-to-bot interactions grows, reducing human dialogue. A satirical thread links AI to academic publishing, imagining authors, journals, and readers all mediated by AI in largely bot-to-bot chains.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Reaction to Slavoj Žižek's Substack/HN appearance, recognizing some automation-related insights while criticizing the long, credential-heavy prose and questioning the piece's overall value.
- Concern: Worry that automation and AI lead to superficial, meaningless output and that verbose, credentialed writing can easily mislead readers.
- Perspectives: Some readers praise the practical points about automating unpleasant tasks, while others deride the style and question the usefulness of AI-based summarization and the piece as "textual wankery."
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 5. [Arduino published updated terms and conditions: no longer an open commons](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46005553)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 Summary: This is a server error from Mod_Security indicating that no acceptable representation of the requested resource could be provided.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Arduino’s Terms of Service and privacy policy update tightens coverage to hosted cloud services and explicitly denies any patent licenses, provoking debate about openness and platform governance.
- Concern: The change could expose users to patent accusations and push the community toward ecosystem lock-in or forks, undermining the open-source ethos.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from seeing it as Qualcommisation and a threat to openness, to arguing the changes only affect cloud services (not the IDE or libraries), to calls for forking or migrating to alternative platforms.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [We remember the internet bubble. This mania looks and feels the same](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46008628)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Three years into AI, the authors liken today’s fever to the 1999 internet bubble—arguably the biggest tech mania yet. AI is accelerating fast, with “dog/mouse years” of progress, yet major stocks have cooled as investors worry about overspending. They offer two conclusions: AI will trigger huge, unimaginable innovations, but its real impact will take longer to materialize than current hype suggests. Global AI-related spending already tops $600B this year and could exceed $1.5T in 2025; if the bubble endures, 2029 spending could surpass $1T. Early funding leans from big tech; history rhymes, not repeats.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether AI is in a speculative bubble, weighing AI's high but uncertain value and its potential political-economic power.
- Concern: The main worry is that AI investments may be overvalued and speculative, risking a market correction with broader economic consequences.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from seeing AI's value as astronomical and power-driven to viewing current valuations as frothy but not a bubble, with some insisting AI already delivers earnings and reality checks ahead.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 7. [We should all be using dependency cooldowns](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46005111)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 Dependency cooldowns—waiting a defined period after a new dependency is published before using it—offer a free, practical defense against most open‑source supply chain attacks. Attacks typically take weeks to months before discovered; the window to exploit a compromised release is short (often days). Cooldowns (via Dependabot, Renovate, or package-manager features) slow adoption, encouraging early vendor alerts while dramatically reducing exposure (7–14 day windows). Not a panacea, but highly effective and easy to implement; calls for built‑in cooldown support in ecosystems to curb social trust issues.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether projects should aggressively update dependencies or adopt a cooldown/slow-update policy, weighing security against stability and practicality.  
- Concern: The main worry is that cooldowns could leave known vulnerabilities unpatched or be exploited by attackers, while frequent updates can introduce bugs and disrupt projects.  
- Perspectives: Views range from advocating monitored, incremental updates and strong dependency discipline (including LTS-like approaches) to skepticism about cooldowns and reliance on source control and vulnerability monitoring, plus calls for project-specific judgment.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [Samsung's 60% DRAM Price Hike Signals a New Phase of Global Memory Tightening](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45934619)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 Samsung has raised memory prices by up to about 60% since September, driven by surging AI data-center demand that is tightening DRAM supply. Reuters notes contract prices for a 32 GB DDR5 module rose from roughly $149 in September to about $239 in November 2025; 16 GB and 128 GB modules up 40–50%, 64–96 GB up over 30%. Analysts cite supply constraints, AI-focused high-bandwidth memory production, and buyer inventories. Retail prices have followed, with 32 GB DDR5 kits around $180–$200 and DDR4 higher. Price pressures may persist into 2026 amid limited capacity gains.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: AI hype is driving market misallocation and dramatic price spikes in DRAM/SSD due to AI data-center demand, impacting consumers and gamers.
- Concern: The worry is ongoing price increases and supply constraints that price out hobbyists and non-AI users, while resources may be diverted to AI needs.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from blaming AI hype for market failure and price gouging to considering consumer strategies (switching to DDR4/older gear) and citing AI data-center demand as the driver.
- Overall sentiment: Frustrated and concerned

## 9. [Building a Durable Execution Engine with SQLite](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45992316)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 Durable Execution (DE) engines persist multi-step workflows so interrupted runs can resume from the last successful step, avoiding redoing work. This is especially valuable for agentic systems interacting with LLMs, where calls are slow and non-deterministic. The article discusses implementing a basic DE engine in Java, called Persistasaurus, with flows defined as Java methods annotated @Flow and steps as @Step. Execution logs are persisted (SQLite) as a durable log akin to a write-ahead log, enabling replays and deterministic progress by resuming from the last completed step, using a unique run ID.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion weighs the value of durable-execution engines for long-running workflows, noting they don't remove the need to handle errors or rollbacks and may add complexity, while exploring lightweight alternatives and DX-enhancing techniques like bytecode generation.
- Concern: The main worry is that the practical benefits of these engines may be overstated, given real failure scenarios and maintenance costs, leading to friction that undermines their value.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic adoption of durable-execution approaches and DX improvements to skepticism about hype and a preference for simpler, queue-based or minimal, easy-to-operate solutions.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
