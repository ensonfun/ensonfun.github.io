## 3. [The UK is still trying to backdoor encryption for Apple users](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45476273)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 The Financial Times reports the UK is again pressing Apple to create a backdoor into encrypted iCloud backups via a Technical Capability Notice under the Investigatory Powers Act, now allegedly limited to British users. Apple previously removed Advanced Data Protection for UK users rather than weaken encryption. The move risks weakening privacy, setting a dangerous precedent, and could invite similar demands worldwide. Concurrently, EU debates Chat Control and ongoing data-retention mandates; the EFF opposes measures that weaken end-to-end encryption, and urges resistance to the STOP CSAM Act and to the EU encryption roadmap. Florida’s SB 868/HB 743 died in 2025.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether Apple’s iCloud data (photos and iMessages) is end-to-end encrypted, the risk of backdoors or government access, and the need for real audits and accountability.
- Concern: The main worry is that without robust audits, governments or other actors can compel access or create backdoors through OTA updates, undermining user privacy.
- Perspectives: Views range from demanding stronger audits and resisting government data requests (even preferring withdrawal from the UK) to noting that ADP is optional and that the current situation in the US already involves non-E2E access to iCloud data.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

- Concern: The main concern is understanding the tool’s motivation and whether adding more languages is feasible, given friction like needing to know the language before invoking a script and potential misclassification of languages (e.g., Swift).
- Perspectives: Perspectives range from enthusiastic praise for the tool to curiosity about the motivation, corrections about language details, and questions about expanding language support.
- Overall sentiment: Positive and curious

## 6. [Blog Feeds](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45475808)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The piece argues for a low-friction alternative to social media: simple, sign-up-free blogs that let you write and share ideas, recipes, or photos in your own voice. It emphasizes three basics: start a blog that isn’t polished or commercial, use RSS readers to subscribe to posts, and create a public feeds page to connect with others. By sharing feeds (and optionally OPML exports), readers can discover new voices in a network that operates without a central authority or major platforms—just you, basic web standards, and your community. —Steve

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion weighs decentralized RSS/blog feeds versus centralized social media, including a personal attempt to centralize feeds and its feasibility.
- Concern: Centralizing RSS could replicate social-media dynamics while undermining decentralization, and a DIY, friction-prone solution may fail to gain traction.
- Perspectives: Views range from valuing decentralized, author-owned feeds to valuing centralized social-media advantages and doubting the viability of a DIY approach.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 Five years after joining an early-stage startup as CTO, the author reflects on a turbulent period marked by COVID-19, wars, inflation, and a changing tech landscape. Initially, the product had no viable blueprint, so they stepped in to connect business needs with technology. Despite doubts, they asked for help and discovered Salesforce development was a hot niche. A Belarusian agency supplied two engineers, the dev environment was set up, and after long nights they demoed the product and signed the first two bank clients. New feedback followed, underscoring the value of staying in your lane and solving real business problems.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread analyzes a startup-focused write-up that argues not all business problems require technical solutions and discusses CTO roles, equity, and startup viability.  
- Concern: The main worry is that CTOs can have little real power after achieving product-market fit, risking misalignment and potential startup failure.  
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from appreciating the honesty and practicality, to advocating non-technical workarounds and platform solutions, to arguing founders should start their own company to control equity, with questions about the fate of the referenced company and the boundaries between startup and small business.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [Self-hosting email like it's 1984](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45473730)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 Self-hosting an email server can automate mailing lists, newsletters, and verification APIs, and is nearly free if you already run a site. Deliverability is the main risk. The author kept setup simple by avoiding multi-user webmail, using a minimal SSH workflow with sendmail, mailx, or Mutt, and only exposing SMTP (port 25); no POP3/IMAP, for local use. Core steps: install Postfix and OpenDKIM, set up a TLS cert for the MX hostname, and publish DKIM, SPF, and DMARC DNS records. PTR is optional and usually controlled by the ISP.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether self-hosted email is practical in modern terms, given reliability, uptime, and deliverability challenges.
- Concern: The main worry is that self-hosted email is fragile, prone to deliverability failures, blacklisting, and external blocks that undermine reliability.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from proud hobbyists who enjoy self-hosting to skeptics who see it as impractical due to ISP blocks, deliverability issues, and maintenance overhead, with some offering hands-on setup guidance.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
