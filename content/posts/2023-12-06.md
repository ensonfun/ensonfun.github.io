### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Sundar's comments in a main video where he appears to emphasize that Google has been involved in AI for a long time. However, the writer finds this attempt at self-promotion unnecessary, especially since the currently most advanced AI model is developed by OpenAI, not Google. The article suggests that instead of talking about it, Google should focus on demonstrating their AI capabilities. The article also mentions a video further down the page that showcases an impressive AI demonstration. Additionally, the article highlights that Google plans to integrate Gemini models into applications using Google AI Studio and Google Cloud Vertex AI, with availability starting from December 13th. The writer hopes that access to these models will be more accessible to many users, similar to OpenAI, rather than being limited to only a few customers.

## 2. [JSONB has landed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38540421)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The JSONB enhancement for SQLite improves the performance of JSON functions by using an internal binary representation of JSON that can be saved to the database. This allows for faster processing and a potential reduction in database size. The JSONB functions accept both text JSON and JSONB inputs and return JSONB outputs. Legacy functionality is preserved, but developers are encouraged to try the new code for improved performance. JSONB is a directly serializable data format that can be sent over the wire and written into another database as a blob. In the future, there may be support for adding JSON and JSONB column types to STRICT tables.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains the difference between the JSON and JSONB datatypes. While they appear similar to applications, JSONB is stored in a binary format on disk, allowing for direct operations without the need for parsing. If using SQLite to write and read full JSON blobs, the JSON datatype is recommended. However, if querying or manipulating data using SQL, JSONB is the better choice.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author points out that JSONB, a format offered by Postgres, has been available for some time and is recommended over plain JSON due to its improved read performance. They provide a link for further information on this topic.

## 4. [Why is Jepsen written in Clojure?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38540761)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The article discusses the reasons why Jepsen, a system for testing concurrent systems like databases, is written in the programming language Clojure. The author explains that Clojure's support for concurrency, its broad client support, concise and adaptable syntax, powerful data structures and standard library functions, "good enough" performance, stability, and mature core were all factors that influenced the choice of Clojure for Jepsen. The author also mentions some drawbacks of Clojure, such as the lack of a widely-accepted static typing system and frustrating aspects of the polymorphism system. Despite these drawbacks, the author believes that after a decade of using Clojure, it was a good tradeoff.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author, a longtime user of Clojure, agrees with Kyle's sentiments about the language. They also find value in having most of their domain code in cljc files, which allows for compilation on both the server-side and client-side. The author highlights the benefits of transducers and transducer pipelines, mentioning their performance, composability, and reusability. They also appreciate the stability and longevity of Clojure, crediting its creator, Rich Hickey, for its backward compatibility. The author notes that Clojure programmers tend to have extensive experience and earn high salaries.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that the biggest issue with Clojure is its ecosystem. There is a lack of accessible and usable tooling, with the available options either being too basic and not following functional paradigms well, or being extremely esoteric and only accessible to expert developers. However, the language itself is praised, and its integration with Java is better than what some critics suggest. The article suggests that if there were frameworks like Rails or Django for Clojure, or even better, a framework like Phoenix, it would be easier to convince teams to adopt the language. Currently, one needs to reinvent the wheel for most projects, except for basic functionalities like http routing, which is also challenging. However, the advantage of being able to use any Maven package and compile to a jar is seen as a tremendous benefit, allowing Clojure to run anywhere a jar can run.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the recent increase in "gluten sensitivity" may actually be sensitivity to mold found on grains. The author mentions experiencing symptoms like a stuffy nose and brain fog after consuming bread and soy sauce, but an allergy test showed no reaction to gluten. The author highlights that grains, particularly flour and oats, are prone to mold contamination, and the US allows higher levels of mold contamination in grains compared to other countries. The article proposes that if individuals have issues with consuming grains in the US, it might be due to a sensitivity to mold rather than gluten or gliadin.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author lived in a rented apartment that was flooded during Hurricane Sandy and became concerned about the lack of action taken by the landlord to prevent mold growth. After moving back in, the author experienced severe allergy-like symptoms, including coughing up blood, difficulty breathing, nausea, and gastrointestinal issues. Upon moving out, the author discovered black mold hiding behind furniture and in corners. A mold air quality test confirmed the presence of toxigenic mold, which was also detected in the author's blood test. It took almost two years for the author to fully recover after moving out. Fortunately, the documentation allowed the author to receive a settlement. The experience has made the author more cautious, now conducting mold air tests before moving anywhere. The new house the author is moving into has passed the mold air test, but mold was found in the insulation after removing the drywall in the author's bedroom.

## 10. [Apple confirms governments using push notifications to surveil users](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38543587)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 Unidentified governments are using push notifications to surveil smartphone users, according to US Senator Ron Wyden. In a letter to the Department of Justice, Wyden stated that foreign officials were demanding data from Google and Apple to track smartphones. He highlighted that the traffic from apps that send push notifications puts the tech giants in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance. Wyden called on the Department of Justice to repeal or modify any policies that impede public discussions of push notification spying. Apple responded by stating that they would update their transparency reporting to disclose these types of requests. Both foreign and US government agencies have reportedly requested metadata related to push notifications to associate anonymous users with specific Apple or Google accounts. The governments making these requests have been described as "democracies allied to the United States," but their identities have not been revealed. Apple advises developers not to include sensitive data in notifications and to encrypt any data before adding it to a notification payload. However, metadata, such as which apps send notifications and how often, is not encrypted and could provide insight into users' app usage.
