### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an innovative application for recurrent models that involves integrating a Language Model (LLM) with a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system in a way that enhances efficiency:

1. **Simultaneous Processing**: The idea is to have the TTS system start generating speech from tokens as soon as they are produced by the LLM, without waiting for the entire sentence or paragraph to be completed. This means while the LLM is processing token 't', the TTS is already converting token 't-1' into speech.

2. **Low Latency and Memory Use**: By using recurrent models with a constant hidden state, which are naturally suited for streaming data, this setup ensures low latency and minimal memory usage since there's no need to store the entire text before starting speech synthesis.

3. **Reduction in Network Calls**: Since both the LLM and TTS are colocated (running on the same hardware), there's no need for additional network calls between the two, further reducing latency and potential points of failure.

4. **Potential Use Cases**: This approach could open up new applications where real-time speech generation from text is critical, enhancing user interaction in systems requiring immediate audio feedback from text input.
