## 4. [In the gut's 'second brain,' key agents of health emerge](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38371808)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article discusses the role of enteric glia, a type of nervous system cell, in digestion and gut health. Enteric glia are found in the gut and have been nicknamed "the second brain" due to their ability to function independently from the brain. They play active roles in digestion, nutrient absorption, blood flow, and immune responses in the gut. Recent studies have identified new subsets of glial cells that sense food as it moves through the digestive tract and signal the gut tissue to contract and move it along. Enteric glia are now being linked to specific gastrointestinal disorders and pain symptoms, and understanding their different roles could be important for developing treatments. New tools and technologies have allowed scientists to study enteric glia and gain a better understanding of their functions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The reductionist argument that claims the brain can be reduced to a computer with inputs and outputs is flawed because it fails to consider the importance of other organs like the gut and skin. To accurately model a human brain, one would need to model the entirety of a human, including the complexity of the microbiota and interactions with the environment. Therefore, the argument falls apart.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article mentions that they have observed that their "first" brain functions better when their "second" brain is in a good state. They attribute this to factors such as consuming probiotic foods, staying hydrated, and engaging in physical activity.

## 5. [Before OpenAI, Sam Altman was fired from Y Combinator by his mentor](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38378216)

**Total comment counts : 77**

### Summary

 The article reports on the ouster of Sam Altman, the former CEO of OpenAI. Altman, who was previously fired by Y Combinator founder Paul Graham, was dismissed due to concerns that he prioritized personal interests over official duties and showed absenteeism. One of his main priorities was growing OpenAI, but he was also accused of investing in start-ups through a personal fund, which was seen as a conflict of interest. Altman's dismissal was not solely based on ideological differences regarding safety concerns vs. commercial interests, but also on his desire to avoid checks on his power and have a board heavily skewed in his favor. The article also mentions Altman's clashes with others in the industry and his ability to inspire loyalty and support among OpenAI employees.

## 7. [FTC authorizes compulsory process for AI-related products and services](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38373191)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has approved a resolution allowing the use of compulsory process in nonpublic investigations involving products and services that use artificial intelligence (AI) or claim to detect its use. This resolution will streamline the issuance of civil investigative demands (CIDs), which are similar to subpoenas, in AI-related investigations while allowing the FTC to determine when CIDs are necessary. The resolution will be in effect for 10 years. AI can be used for beneficial purposes but also presents potential risks such as fraud and unfair practices that violate the FTC Act. The FTC aims to promote competition, protect consumers, and educate them on consumer topics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has authorized three new compulsory process resolutions to investigate unfair practices in the car rental industry, harmful business practices targeting service members and children, and allegations of bias in algorithms and biometrics. This is not considered unusual as the FTC has taken similar measures in the past.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the proliferation of products and services that claim to have been produced using artificial intelligence (AI). It suggests that there may not be a decline in such claims unless the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) actually takes significant action. The author distinguishes between cases where AI was actually used but not disclosed, and cases where the term "artificial intelligence" is being excessively stretched to capitalize on advertising trends.

## 8. [Bacteria store memories and pass them on for generations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38372687)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Scientists at The University of Texas at Austin have discovered that bacteria can form memories that enable them to adapt to different environmental conditions. The researchers found that E. coli bacteria use iron levels to store and pass along information about different behaviors. For example, bacteria with lower iron levels were better at moving collectively, while those with higher iron levels formed dense biofilms on surfaces. These memories can persist for several generations and could potentially be targeted for therapeutic purposes in combating bacterial infections. The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a study on worms that suggests they are capable of regrowing old memories when their heads are removed and replaced. It also mentions previous claims from the 1950s where planarian worms were taught certain tasks and the trait seemed to transfer to other worms when they were fed to them. The validity of these claims is uncertain, but it is intriguing if they are true.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The bacteria have a form of memory within their immune system that helps protect them against viruses called phages. They cut up the phage genome and store pieces of it within their own genome. When they detect the phage genes again, they can produce defenses against them. This system is known as CRISPR, or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.

## 9. [I tested four NVMe SSDs from four vendors – half lose FLUSH'd data on power loss (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38371307)

**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 The article mentions that JavaScript is disabled in the browser and provides instructions to enable it or switch to a supported browser in order to continue using twitter.com. It also mentions that a list of supported browsers can be found in their Help Center and provides links to their Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Imprint. The article is copyrighted by X Corp in 2023.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a recent release of OBS software that included a shader cache. However, there were reports from users that the cached data was not valid. Upon investigation, it was found that the cache files were the correct size but had all zeroes in the content. This was surprising because on a journaled file system, this issue should not occur. The current hypothesis is that some users have SSDs that are not properly handling flushes and causing data corruption in the event of a crash or power loss.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that the headline is misleading because after testing eight more drives, none of them failed. The author also points out that "2/12" is not as dramatic as "half" and mentions that the drives that lost data were cheap brands, which is to be expected.
