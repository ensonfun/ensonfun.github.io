## 5. [Appeals Court: FBI's Safe-Deposit Box Seizures Violated Fourth Amendment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39111539)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 A panel of federal appeals court judges at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that the FBI violated the Fourth Amendment when agents searched over 700 safe-deposit boxes in the aftermath of a raid in March 2021. The judges determined that the FBI went beyond the scope of its warrant and did not follow proper protocol when opening the boxes, using drug-sniffing dogs, and attempting to seize money and valuables found inside. The ruling focused on the existence of "supplemental instructions" that authorized agents to look for cash and potential criminal proceeds in the boxes, despite the warrant explicitly forbidding a criminal search or seizure. Judge Milan D. Smith Jr. wrote that the lack of a limiting principle for customized inventory searches is troubling and likened it to a criminal investigation. The court also found that the government had used information from inside the boxes to obtain additional warrants for further investigations. The FBI declined to comment on the ruling, and the case has been remanded back to the district court. The ruling emphasizes the importance of the Fourth Amendment and its protection against abuses of power by government authorities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article conducted a thought experiment on how to store something in a box or envelope while being able to determine if someone else has looked at it. They concluded that searching for "holographic tamper" on AliExpress would yield stickers with unique numbers and differently-aligned background patterns. These stickers could be used to seal the container, and photos could be taken to record each sticker and its pattern. While there may be some ways to exploit this system, it would likely deter non-sophisticated attackers.

## 7. [Balancing engineering cultures: Debate everything vs. just tell me what to build](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39112848)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 This article discusses the spectrum of culture between product management and engineering in companies. It states that neither extreme - "debate and question everything, build nothing" and "just tell me what to build and I'll build it" - is healthy for a company. The article then provides advice from engineering and product leaders on how to shift out of these extreme cultures. It emphasizes the importance of change and having a balanced incentive structure within the company. Additionally, it suggests ways to break free from endless debate and make effective decisions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two common failure modes that occur in rapidly growing companies. The first failure mode is when there is a lack of clarity regarding who makes the final decisions. This leads to endless debates and slow progress. The second failure mode is when product managers view themselves as facilitators instead of taking charge and making decisions. They focus on process and documentation, but struggle to actually determine what should be built.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that it is best to train developers to take action and then provide feedback without judgment when their work does not meet expectations. This approach allows developers to move quickly and eventually build useful things. However, fostering an attitude of "just tell me what to build" can overload the management layer and create dysfunction. The ideal culture is one where project managers understand customer problems and provide prompt and effective feedback to developers. Management should then allow developers to work quickly. The ultimate goal is to have a talented developer who can quickly create something amazing while the company maintains and benefits from it. If that is not possible, having a product manager who understands customer needs and can organize engineers to create a product that satisfies customers is also valuable. The author emphasizes that software developer productivity can be unpredictable, with some moments being highly valuable and others having little or negative value. The focus should be on navigating these spikes and not getting caught up in day-to-day issues.

## 8. [Lumiere: A space-time diffusion model for realistic video generation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39114075)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 The article discusses Lumiere, a text-to-video diffusion model developed by Google Research for realistic video generation. Lumiere utilizes a Space-Time U-Net architecture that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once, unlike existing models that synthesize distant keyframes. By leveraging spatial and temporal down- and up-sampling, as well as a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, Lumiere can directly generate full-frame-rate, low-resolution videos. The model achieves state-of-the-art text-to-video generation results and can be used for various content creation tasks and video editing applications. It enables consistent video editing by animating the content of specific regions within an image. The article also expresses gratitude to those who collaborated, provided feedback, and shared valuable assets for the experiments.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of this article is deeply offended by a work presented as scientific research, calling it bragging, advertising, or marketing. They highlight that there are no reproducible processes described and no opportunity for falsification, which is a crucial aspect of scientific research. The author also expresses skepticism about the authenticity of the examples provided by Google, suggesting that every example may have been cherry-picked and post-processed. They argue that it should be assumed that the data used to train the model was illicitly acquired. The author criticizes Google for routinely making claims that cannot be demonstrated and compares the performance of the Gemini model to GPT-4, stating that Gemini falls far short. They also mention a video released by Google, claiming it was an interaction with a model but turned out to be different. The author concludes by stating that no organization should operate in this manner, but Google is seen as an egregious repeat offender.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a video generation model developed by Google. The author notices that the model produces more consistent and longer examples compared to other techniques. They also observe that the legs in the generated videos do not slide on the floor as much as in other models. However, the author finds that the model does not generate good representations of human faces, giving the example of the Mona Lisa smiling. Although the author considers this to be a promising video generation model, they mention that it is unlikely to be publicly released as it is developed by Google.
