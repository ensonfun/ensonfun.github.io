## 7. [ATProto for distributed system engineers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41484337)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the AT Protocol (AT Proto) as a technology developed for open social networking. It explores AT Proto from the perspective of distributed backend engineering. The traditional "one big SQL database" architecture faces performance limits as the application grows. To address this, the article suggests switching to a NoSQL cluster and using precomputed views called view servers. However, keeping the view servers synced with the NoSQL cluster becomes challenging. To solve this, an event log (e.g., Kafka) is introduced to record and broadcast changes. This stream processing architecture sacrifices strong consistency for scalability. The goal of AT Proto is to interconnect applications by sharing state, including user accounts and content. The article describes how the system can be decentralized, with each internal service having public APIs and allowing others to create their own instances of these services. A shared data model called the "user data repository" is established, and JSON documents organized into collections are stored within the data repositories. URLs and cryptographic signing are used to ensure authenticity. Overall, AT Proto aims to create a high-scale decentralized backend for applications.
