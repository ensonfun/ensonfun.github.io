### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The word "character" has its origins in Latin and Greek, derived from the idea of scratching or engraving. It is like a metal shield that accumulates scratches and grooves through life's challenges, leading towards either virtue or vice. Making wise choices consistently forms these grooves, making it easier to do the right thing in difficult situations. These principles also apply to seemingly unimportant tasks, as they still contribute to our character.

## 5. [{n} times faster than C](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36618344)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article discusses optimizing a loop generated from C code by clang. The author identifies areas where the compiler can be improved and makes tweaks to the code to measure speedup. They rearrange the loop to prioritize certain characters over null terminators, optimize branch instructions, and use conditional moves instead of conditional branches. They also compare the code generated by clang and GCC and find that GCC's code is faster but longer. The author concludes that there can be a significant speedup by hand-coding tight C loops in assembly and using techniques not yet automated by compilers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a comparison between hand-written assembler and C code in terms of performance. The author argues that the key difference is not necessarily the language itself, but rather the impact of jumps versus conditional arithmetic. The article provides an example of rewriting a C function to achieve a 5.5x speedup by replacing switch statements with if statements. The results show that the hand-written assembler is faster than the C code, but the author suggests that this is mainly due to the difference in how jumps and conditional arithmetic are handled in each language.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two different ways to write code for a particular function. The first code example is not optimized for compilers, but it will produce the same result as the optimized assembly code. However, it won't take advantage of loop unrolling and vectorization. The second code example is optimized for size and will utilize AVX-512 instructions if available. It will be significantly faster than the first code example for larger inputs. The article suggests using the second approach if the size of the string is known in advance. It provides a link for further reference.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that Nvidia has not been successful in mobile and embedded computing, server market, and data centers, and has remained mainly limited to gaming. However, it has had unexpected success with its parallel GPU in Bitcoin mining and AI. The article credits Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem for its ability to outperform competitors and suggests that its time to shine has finally come.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article states that one of the main reasons Nvidia continues to be successful is because AMD does not put effort into competing with them. Competition is typically associated with offering customers impressive, fast, and affordable graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia, being the top player, no longer feels the need to compete and has focused less on providing low-cost, high-performance GPUs. This has created an opportunity for AMD to offer consumers these desirable features and potentially surpass Nvidia. However, instead of taking advantage of this opportunity, AMD has chosen to emulate Nvidia by producing slow and uncompetitive GPUs at high prices. Therefore, in a sense, AMD is inadvertently helping Nvidia maintain its position at the top.
