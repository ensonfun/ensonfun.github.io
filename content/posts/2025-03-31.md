**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article discusses the recognition of the demoscene as a national UNESCO heritage in Sweden, following an application submitted by the author and Ziphoid. This initiative is part of a broader effort to establish the demoscene as a global UNESCO heritage under the Art of Coding initiative, which highlights the demoscene's significance as one of the oldest creative digital subcultures. The author notes the demoscene's enduring values and traditions amidst technological changes and emphasizes its competitive nature focused on maximizing hardware. However, not all participants engage in production; some contribute by organizing events or preserving software. The writer reflects on the contrasting experiences within the international demoscene versus local communities, where personal interactions and creative freedom are vital. The diversity within the scene is notable, encompassing a wide range of backgrounds and motivations. Ultimately, the author argues for the demoscene's intangible heritage status, recognizing both its consistency and openness.

## 3. [In the 1980s we downloaded games from the radio](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43510393)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 The article reflects on the nostalgic experience of downloading video games from radio broadcasts in the 1980s by recording audio onto cassette tapes. The author recalls that this practice was a reality, contrary to claims made in comments on a Facebook post denying its existence. Set against the backdrop of early 1980s UK, when home computers were emerging amidst economic challenges, the piece discusses the role of the BBC's Computer Literacy Project. This initiative included both television programs and a lesser-known radio series called "The Chip Shop," which aimed to educate the public about computers.

Home computers of the time used cassette players for data storage, resulting in a unique method where audio screeches would load games onto computers. The article highlights an issue faced by the BBC: different computer brands required different audio formats. To address this, the Dutch broadcaster NOS developed a system called BASICODE, allowing software to run on various devices. The BBC expanded upon this with BASICODE 2, enabling the broadcasting of programs that enthusiasts could record and use on their computers. This innovative idea spawned "The Chip Shop Takeaway," a late-night broadcast of BASICODE programs for home computer users to enjoy. The article captures the blend of nostalgia and technological evolution of that era.

## 4. [Installing air filters in classrooms has surprisingly large educational benefits (2020)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43529257)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article discusses a surprising finding from Michael Gilraine's study, "Air Filters, Pollution, and Student Achievement," which explores the positive impact of air filters installed in schools after the Aliso Canyon gas leak in 2015. Although the gas leak raised public health concerns, air testing indicated that schools near the leak did not exhibit abnormally high pollution levels. The installation of $700 air filters in classrooms led to significant increases in student test scores—0.20 standard deviations in math and 0.18 in English—suggesting that reducing indoor air pollution can substantially enhance academic performance. These results are comparable to the benefits observed from reducing class sizes, providing a cost-effective intervention, especially for low-income students. The article advocates for further experimentation with air filters in schools to validate and understand the extent of their impact on education.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the installation of air filters in classrooms, emphasizing support for this initiative while expressing skepticism about the dramatic results from a recent study. The research examined student achievement in schools affected by the largest gas leak in U.S. history, comparing schools with air filters to those without. The author argues that the study's methodology—analyzing test scores over various years and assuming air filters were the sole variable—overlooks significant yearly variations and other influential factors, like teaching differences and school policies. While the author acknowledges the benefits of air filtration, they caution against expecting substantial improvements in test scores, likening the claims to past exaggerated health benefits of fish oil supplements that were eventually disproven in larger studies.
