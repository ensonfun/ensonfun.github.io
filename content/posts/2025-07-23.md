## 7. [Uv: Running a script with dependencies](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44641521)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The article discusses using the `uv` tool for managing Python scripts and their dependencies efficiently. `uv` automates virtual environment creation, prefers a declarative approach to dependencies, and allows scripts to run without needing a manually configured environment. It supports inline metadata for requesting dependencies, specifying Python versions, and utilizing alternative package indices. Dependencies can be locked using a `.lock` file for consistency, and scripts can be run without `uv` using a shebang for ease. The tool also offers options to refine dependency management and enhance script reproducibility.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The "declaring script dependencies" feature simplifies running Python scripts by allowing you to specify dependencies directly in the script. For example, by adding a list of dependencies, you can execute the script using "uv run script.py," which automatically installs required packages in a temporary virtual environment. This method implements Python PEP 723. Notably, Claude 4 now understands this feature, enabling users to easily generate Python scripts with inline dependencies. Previously, such capabilities required custom setup, but the new functionality eliminates that need.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author warns against a common mistake when using a script designed to power cycle a router during internet outages. They realized that the script, relying on `uv` to download dependencies, would fail if the internet was down. They pre-installed the necessary dependencies to avoid this issue but caution others not to use similar setups for scripts that may run without an internet connection, as caching may not always prevent dependency errors.
