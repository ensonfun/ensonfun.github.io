## 1. [VanillaJSX.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41269321)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 The article explores the idea of using JSX to create reusable DOM elements with their own state. It questions how JSX components could work together to create an interactive DOM tree and handle large data without relying on a virtual DOM. It also considers how complex state could be managed and how parent components could react to changes in their children. The author suggests using the @imlib/jsx-browser.js runtime and compiling JSX with @swc/core. The idea originated from the author's work on imlib and encourages readers to explore the source code for further information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the advantages of using JSX and non-JSX libraries like Lit for creating dynamic user interfaces. It suggests that returning a description of the DOM rather than actual DOM nodes allows for more efficient updates and reevaluation of templates with new state. The article also highlights the benefit of using a virtual DOM (VDOM) to iterate over items in a template, avoiding the need for imperative DOM APIs. It mentions that the main drawback of VDOMs is slow diffing, which can be resolved by using templates that separate static and dynamic parts. The author mentions that they work on the Lit library, which addresses this issue.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author created a static site generator (SSG) using JSX because they were frustrated with the complexity of other JSX frameworks like React. This SSG renders JSX as strings and can also render JSX as DOM elements in the browser. The author admits that some parts of their solution are hacky and that IDE support could be better. They also mention that their solution is good for SEO, which is a problem that other JSX frameworks didn't solve well.

## 2. ["Frost crack" sounds may come from sky, not trees](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41240631)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 An acoustic experiment conducted by acoustics professor Unto Laine at Aalto University in Finland has discovered that spooky forest sounds heard at night may actually come from the sky, rather than from the trees themselves. Laine's interest in this phenomenon was sparked when he heard unexplained snaps of sound during an auroral storm in 1990. He began the Auroral Acoustics Project in 2000 to investigate these sounds further. Despite initial skepticism and challenges in explaining the source of the sounds, Laine was able to prove their atmospheric origin through audio recordings and triangulation data. These sounds, which occur at a height of around 230 feet, are associated with a meteorological process called inversion. Inversion occurs when warm air rises, trapping ions and building up energy that eventually discharges with crackling and popping sounds similar to lightning bolts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recalls reading the book "The Hatchet" in grade school, which tells the story of a man surviving a plane crash near the arctic circle with only a hatchet. The man mistakenly believes cracking sounds in the wilderness are gun shots and a sign of rescue, but later learns they are actually trees cracking from the extreme cold. The author finds this revelation even more captivating as an adult.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how spooky noises that were previously attributed to trees may actually come from the night sky. The author argues that while this research demonstrates that the night sky can produce sounds under certain conditions, it does not imply that all mysterious noises come from the sky. The author also points out that the supposed tree cracking sound is typically heard in areas with trees, rather than on open plains or above frozen lakes.

## 4. [Zngur: A C++/Rust interop tool](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41271273)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 Zngur is a tool that enables interoperability between C++ and Rust. It allows users to utilize Rust types, methods, and functions in C++ code while maintaining their original semantics and ease of use. Zngur facilitates the use of Rust crates in C++ as seamlessly as using them in Rust code, and it enables the creation of idiomatic Rust APIs for C++ libraries within C++. While Rust and C++ have some differences, Zngur provides more flexibility for C++ to use Rust types, store them in the C++ stack, and call Rust methods and functions. However, Zngur does not translate C++ types into Rust due to ergonomic reasons. Instead, it allows users to create a Rust wrapper for their C++ library, implement Rust traits for C++ types, cast them as `Box<dyn Trait>`, implement inherent methods on Rust types, implement Rust traits for Rust types, and expose C++ bare functions that operate on Rust types. Detailed examples can be found in the `examples/simple` folder for building and running.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author briefly looks at some code and finds it plausible. They then discuss the importance of well-executed foreign function interface (FFI) stories with C++ for the Rust ecosystem. They point out that the community's commitment to C++ interop has been lacking. The author acknowledges that Rust may be superior to C++ in certain domains, but acknowledges that there is a large amount of C++ code that cannot be rewritten in a reasonable timeframe. They highlight use cases where Rust is a better choice, such as applications with an attack surface, but caution against the idea of rewriting everything in Rust without considering interop. The author expresses support for more incremental efforts.

## 6. [X ordered to pay €550k to Irish employee fired after yes-or-resign ultimatum](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41272861)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter, has been ordered to pay €550,000 ($602,640) to a former employee in Ireland in an unfair dismissal case. The employee, Gary Rooney, was dismissed in December 2022 after he failed to commit to new working arrangements in an email from Musk. X claimed that Rooney had resigned voluntarily, but the commission ruled that not ticking a box in response to the email did not constitute resignation. This is the largest sum ever awarded by the Irish Workplace Relations Commission. Since Musk acquired Twitter, the company has faced multiple lawsuits and allegations of withheld severance benefits.

## 7. [Fun times with energy-based models](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41269444)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 This article discusses Energy-Based Models (EBMs), which are generative models used to learn the underlying distribution of data and generate new samples. Unlike other generative models, EBMs learn to assign low energy to likely data configurations and high energy to unlikely ones. The article explains how to sample data from EBMs and introduces Langevin dynamics as a method for sampling. It also explores different approaches to training EBMs, including maximum likelihood estimation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is being advised to address a confusing aspect in the proof. Specifically, in Step 6, the integration by parts technique is applied to the "uv" term and the range of integration suddenly appears to be from -∞ to ∞, which assumes that x ∈ ℝ. However, in other parts of the article and in the examples, higher-dimensional x's are mentioned. The author is suggested to either include the full multidimensional version from the paper or explicitly clarify that this is the simple 1d case, but the same result holds in ℝ^n, and refer to the paper for further details.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the rationale behind using tricks like score matching and contrastive divergence due to the computational expense of the partition function. The author also asks about the current usefulness of Energy-Based Models (EBMs).
