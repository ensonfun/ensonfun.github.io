**Total comment counts : 41**

### Summary

 The article by Nico Dekens warns about the growing reliance on Generative AI (GenAI) tools in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) work, highlighting a concerning shift from critical thinking to misplaced trust in automation. Dekens observes that analysts initially use AI for small tasks but gradually cede more cognitive responsibilities, leading to diminished scrutiny and verification of information. A significant study indicates that increased confidence in AI correlates with reduced critical thinking, as users tend to replace their own judgment with the AI's output. This trend poses serious risks in OSINT, where accuracy and integrity are crucial, given the complex and fragmented nature of data analysts work with. The article serves as a wake-up call for OSINT professionals to reclaim their critical thinking skills to avoid the dangers of relying too heavily on automation, ultimately advocating for a balance between leveraging AI tools and maintaining analytical rigor.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the phenomenon of professionals outsourcing their critical thinking to large language models (LLMs), likening it to previous trends where individuals relied on various media sources such as podcasts and social media for opinions. It suggests that this reliance on LLMs contributes to a false sense of critical thinking, as users feel informed and smart even though they are simply regurgitating the opinions they encounter, rather than engaging in independent thought. The author argues that this trend represents a pattern of seeking confirmation and easy conclusions, rather than genuine expertise.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The main challenge in open source intelligence (OSINT) is sifting through large volumes of information to find valuable insights rather than conducting in-depth analysis. The CIA has implemented a generative AI system, OSIRIS, primarily for summarizing information. OSINT operations in the U.S. date back to World War II with the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service, which was essential during the Cold War. Previously, summaries were published on paper but ceased due to copyright issues. The Department of Defense also had a daily newsletter called The Early Bird, which included relevant news articles for its leaders, although it was not meant for external distribution.
