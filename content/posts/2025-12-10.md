### Summary

 It instructs users to enable JavaScript and disable ad blockers to access the site's content.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on Australia’s minimum-age social media law (under-16 account restrictions and age verification) and whether it will be effective or harmful.
- Concern: The main worry is that mandatory ID verification and age-based bans may normalize ID sharing, invite scams and predation, drive youths to fringe or unregulated networks, and entail privacy and civil-liberty tradeoffs with uncertain benefit.
- Perspectives: Views range from seeing a modest, non-perfect measure that could slow network effects and protect kids to seeing it as misguided, politically motivated, potentially counterproductive, and likely to push users to VPNs or other platforms.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Apple Services are experiencing a multi-service outage affecting TV, Music, and App Store Connect/TestFlight, with anticipation of a post-mortem.
- Concern: The outage risks continued downtime and disruption for users and developers, including inability to submit builds to TestFlight.

## 4. [Super Mario 64 for the PS1](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46221925)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 This page describes a very work-in-progress port of the n64decomp/sm64 project for the PlayStation 1. It notes that feedback is read seriously and points to documentation for qualifiers. The repository does not include all assets needed to compile the game; an original copy of Super Mario 64 is required to extract assets. Pull requests are welcome, and for major changes, an issue should be opened first. The page also contains repeated loading-error messages.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread discusses a ground-up effort to clone Super Mario 64 on the Game Boy Advance and related port projects, including video references and other console efforts.  
- Concern: The main worry is that affine texture warping and limited tessellation on the GBA may prevent a satisfactory port unless level geometry is redesigned, raising feasibility doubts.  
- Perspectives: Opinions range from enthusiastic interest and appreciation for developer work (e.g., Kaze) to skepticism about hardware limitations and the need for substantial redesigns, with additional notes on other Dreamcast and multi-platform ports.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 5. [Auto-grading decade-old Hacker News discussions with hindsight](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46220540)

**Total comment counts : 38**

### Summary

 In a December 2025 post, the author describes using Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.1 Thinking to analyze Hacker News front pages from December 2015. He copied threads, then used LLMs to retrospectively compare thoughts and outcomes. The project, on GitHub at karpathy/hn-time-capsule, fetches 31 days × 30 articles and yields analyses for historical reading. He notes a “Hall of Fame” of top commenters and that 930 queries cost about $58 (~1 hour). It argues LLM-based retrospectives and vibe coding are fast, cheap, scalable.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Debating the value of online predictions and the viability and consequences of using LLM-based reviews to judge whether comments predicted real outcomes
- Concern: LLM reviews may misjudge predictive success due to biases and training data, reinforcing conformity and raising privacy risks
- Perspectives: Some see value in surfacing accurate, boring predictions and considering accuracy-based scoring or weighted upvotes, while others worry about bias and misalignment of the LLM and stress safeguards and privacy implications
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [Scientists create ultra fast memory using light](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46150797)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread weighs whether MRAM-CIM and memristors (with a nod to photonic computing) will significantly boost memory bandwidth and AI performance, amid hype and headline misinterpretations.
- Concern: The main worry is that hype and misinformation about timelines, chip scales (300mm vs nm), and supply commitments could mislead readers.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic optimism about faster memory technologies to caution about hype, errors, and speculative claims.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 7. [Terrain Diffusion: A Diffusion-Based Successor to Perlin Noise](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46221594)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 arXivLabs is a framework that lets collaborators develop and share new arXiv features directly on the site. Partners—individuals or organizations—embrace openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv commits to these values and works only with partners who uphold them. If you have a project idea that could benefit arXiv’s community, learn more about arXivLabs and its operational status.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion analyzes a diffusion-based approach to procedural terrain generation, focusing on speed, control, practicality, and novelty.  
- Concern: The main concern is that the method is slow, lacks reliable conditioning, and may not be practical or novel enough to displace established, faster terrain techniques or traditional noise methods.  
- Perspectives: Opinions vary from praising its visuals, scalability, and potential applications (e.g., Minecraft terrains, texture generation) to skepticism about its practicality, limited novelty, training dependence, and applicability to non-flat or non-Earthlike worlds.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [Qwen3-Omni-Flash-2025-12-01：a next-generation native multimodal large model](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219538)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on Qwen's 3-Omni family (including a 30B model with 3B active) and the viability, performance, and real-time capabilities of open-weight Omni LLMs.  
- Concern: A primary worry is whether these models truly support real-time conversation on local hardware and non-NVIDIA systems, and whether open-weight availability and tooling meet the hype.  
- Perspectives: Opinions range from seeing open-weight Omni models as a significant breakthrough with strong local-use potential to skepticism about actual real-time support, deployment difficulty, and API-only access.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed, cautiously optimistic.
