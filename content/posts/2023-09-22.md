## 3. [Outperforming larger language models with less training data and smaller models](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37606352)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of deploying large language models (LLMs) for real-world applications due to their size and computational requirements. To overcome this, practitioners often deploy smaller specialized models using fine-tuning or distillation methods. However, these methods require expensive human-generated labels or large amounts of unlabeled data. The article introduces a new mechanism called "distilling step-by-step," which extracts informative natural language rationales from LLMs and uses them to train smaller models more efficiently. By incorporating these rationales as additional supervision, the distilling step-by-step method achieves better performance using less training data and smaller model sizes compared to standard fine-tuning or distillation approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method across different NLP tasks. The article concludes that distilling step-by-step provides a resource-efficient paradigm that addresses the trade-off between model size and training data requirements.

## 5. [AWS Customers Cannot Escape IPv4](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37608900)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 AWS has announced that they will start charging for public IPv4 addresses, which has been mostly welcomed as it is expected to encourage IPv6 adoption. The charge will apply to dedicated public AWS IPv4 addresses at a rate of $0.005 per hour starting in February 2024. The article discusses some anti-patterns to watch out for and highlights the impact of the charge on services like Elastic Load Balancer and Managed NAT Gateway. It also explores the benefits of IPv6 adoption and the challenges of running IPv6-only environments on AWS. Despite the charge, the article argues that AWS has neglected IPv6 support and that the charge will not drive IPv6 adoption. The article concludes by mentioning that upcoming blog posts will delve into more detailed topics related to IPv6 support on AWS.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a past project at Amazon to split up internal systems into regional versions due to a shortage of internal IPv4 addresses. The Principal PM leading the effort explained that switching to IPv6 was not feasible because a large number of internal networking devices did not support it. Replacing these devices would have required purchasing nearly the world's entire yearly output of such devices, making it a massive and time-consuming project. The author acknowledges that while it is easy to assume malicious intent on Amazon's part, the scale of their AWS systems suggests that replacing old network hardware may simply be too large of a task to accomplish quickly.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article claims that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has incentives to discourage the use of IPv6 in their services. The author argues that AWS's recommended practices and tools steer users towards building networks with ambiguous addressing using the 10.x RFC1918 range, instead of using internet-style architectures with end-to-end addressing. The article also suggests that AWS discourages the concept of public IP addresses and offers additional tools to detect and mitigate their use, which can generate dependency and add complexity at the expense of security.

## 6. [Turning an old car into a powerful generator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37610230)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 This article discusses how to convert an old car into a powerful generator. The author explains that generators can be expensive, but old cars with working engines can be obtained for a low price. The author mentions Jake von Slatt's video series, where he demonstrates how to convert a Toyota Sienna minivan into a generator. The engine of the minivan is still functional, making it suitable for this purpose. To maintain a steady 60Hz output, an Arduino is used to control the cruise control actuator, which keeps the engine stable at 3600rpm. This method allows for the repurposing of both an old car and an old generator, providing off-grid power.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that if you want to optimize the fuel efficiency of your car engine when using it to power a generator, you should consider using a gearbox between the engine and generator. Running the engine at around 2000 rpm at high load is typically the most efficient, although lower RPMs may be more efficient at lower loads. However, it is important to consider the cooling capacity of your car's system when running at high loads for extended periods. To achieve the optimal RPM for the generator, you can run the engine at 1800 rpm with a 1:2 gear ratio. This approach simplifies the design process and is considered to be "close enough" to the ideal configuration without needing detailed knowledge of your engine's efficiency and power curves.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a conversion project where an individual replaced a broken internal combustion engine (ICE) with a generator in a car. The author questions the logic of this conversion, suggesting that it would have been more practical and cost-effective to simply replace the ICE with a standard engine. They highlight the additional space requirements, investment in electronics, and the end result of having a car with limited generator power. While acknowledging the resourcefulness of the conversion, the author cannot understand why someone would choose this approach.

## 7. [The Bogus CVE Problem](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37608110)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The article discusses the problems with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system, which is used to track vulnerabilities in software. While CVE numbers are effective for tracking vulnerabilities, the process of assigning CVEs and their severity scores is flawed. The system can be gamed, and the organizations overseeing it have not done a great job. The article highlights an incident with an integer-overflow bug in the curl tool, which was given a high severity score by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) despite not being a security problem. The article argues that the CVE system is broken in various ways and that open-source projects need to figure out how to coexist with it.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two incidents related to Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). The first incident, known as CVE-2020-19909, is described as an example of what is wrong with CVEs. The second incident pertains to bogus follow-ups on CVEs. The article provides links to discussions on Hacker News for further reference.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article criticizes the CVE database, stating that it is too noisy to be useful and lacks higher standards and thorough vetting. They provide two examples: a security researcher filed a CVE for a bug in Caddy with false claims, and a 0-day vulnerability in acme.sh was assigned a high CVSS score despite being relatively benign. The author concludes that the CVE system is broken and they are now ignoring CVEs, but will still patch their system if instructed.

## 8. [Ways to capture changes in Postgres](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37610899)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 This article discusses various methods for capturing and processing changes in PostgreSQL. The first method mentioned is using Postgres' interprocess communication feature, Listen/Notify, which allows a session to listen to a channel for notifications and receive instant updates when changes occur. However, Listen/Notify has limitations such as the need for continuous listening and payload size restrictions. 

Another method is to poll the table directly, where each table has an updated_at column that is updated whenever a row changes. This method is simple but lacks the ability to detect deleted rows or provide detailed information on the changes made.

Streaming replication is another option, where Postgres sends the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) stream over a network connection to a replica database, keeping it in sync with the primary database. This method requires replication slots and can be complex to set up and debug.

Creating a separate table for logging changes and using triggers to populate it is another approach. This method allows for easy querying of the changelog but may require additional tweaks for large-scale production use.

Foreign Data Wrappers (FDWs) are a feature in Postgres that allow reading from and writing to external data sources. Using FDWs to capture changes is uncommon, but it can be useful when replicating changes between Postgres databases.

Ultimately, the choice of method depends on the specific requirements and complexity of the application. The article also mentions that none of the existing methods met the author's specific needs, leading them to build a custom Postgres proxy.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article emphasizes the use of triggers and history tables (audit tables) as a reliable technique for data management. The author recommends adopting this approach, which has been in use for over 30 years. They provide a generic method for implementing it and highlight the importance of not forgetting mutable data in databases. The article discourages using application-based history tracking libraries, as they can be slow, error-prone, and unable to capture changes that bypass the application stack. Instead, the author advocates for using the database clock for capturing accurate timestamps.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This blog provides a concise overview of different approaches native to Postgres. The "capture changes in an audit table" section discusses the use of Temporal Tables pattern, which is not built into Postgres but can be implemented using a SQL function. This pattern allows for viewing a table's state at a specific point in time and can be used for various purposes such as querying user configurations, checking unprocessed records, or comparing feature flags. The article also includes a link to a GitHub repository for more information on implementing Temporal Tables in Postgres.

## 9. [GitHub Actions could be so much better](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37612420)

**Total comment counts : 52**

### Summary

 The author of the article expresses their love for GitHub Actions but also points out frustrations and areas for improvement. They describe their experiences with setting up workflows and the difficulties they encountered during the debugging process. The author suggests implementing an interactive debugging shell and the ability to re-run workflows with small changes without going through a git commit cycle. They also call for a repository setting to reject commits with invalid workflows and push-time rejection of insecure workflows. The article discusses potential security vulnerabilities and suggests stricter type-checking and more official actions for better security. The author concludes by emphasizing the need for GitHub to address these concerns and improve the platform.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two approaches to building workflows with GitHub Actions. The first approach involves programming with GitHub Actions and using marketplace tools, resulting in long and complex workflows. This approach can lead to difficulties in understanding and maintaining the YAML code. The second approach is to configure workflows with GitHub Actions by pushing the complexity into scripts whenever possible. This results in shorter workflows that are easier to maintain. Despite the benefits of the second approach, many teams still choose the first approach, which can lead to vendor lock-in and debugging challenges. The article emphasizes the advantages of the second approach, such as lower vendor lock-in and easier debugging.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article talks about the author's frustration with setting up a new GitHub actions pipeline. They explain that they always create a new branch and push their changes there until everything is working properly. Once it's working, they squash merge all the changes into a single commit.
