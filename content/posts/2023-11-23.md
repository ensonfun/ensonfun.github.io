## 1. [test, [, and [[ (2020)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38387464)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The article discusses the existence of a binary in Unix systems with the symbol "[" as its name. The binary, also known as "test," is used in Unix shells to evaluate expressions and perform comparisons. The article explains that the reason for having two names for the same binary is likely to make the code look more aesthetically pleasing. The article also mentions that the "[" binary is often implemented as a built-in command in shells for efficiency. Another variation, "[[" is a Bash extension that replaces the use of "[" and has additional features. The article concludes by mentioning that test expressions and shell expressions can be combined in a single invocation.

Luiz André Barroso, an engineer at Google for over 20 years, is recognized for designing the company's large-scale data centers. These centers house numerous computer servers and disk drives and have played a significant role in advancements such as cloud computing, more powerful search engines, and faster Internet service. Barroso passed away unexpectedly from natural causes. He was born in Brazil, received degrees in electrical engineering, and went on to earn a Ph.D. in computer engineering. Before joining Google, he worked at Digital Equipment Corp. and Compaq. At Google, Barroso developed efficient data center designs using low-cost components and energy-saving techniques, leading to the establishment of multiple data centers worldwide. He also contributed to the design of Google's AI chips and integrated augmented reality and machine learning into Google Maps. Barroso received recognition for his work, including the Eckert-Mauchly Award and held the position of Google Fellow.

Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao, former director of the Indian Statistical Institute, was a pioneering mathematician and statistician. He spent over four decades at the institute and made significant discoveries in statistics, particularly the Cramér-Rao bound and the Rao-Blackwell theorem. These estimators have been fundamental to modern statistics. Rao began his career at the Indian Statistical Institute and published a paper unveiling these important concepts. He later became a professor and director at the institute. Rao's work formed the basis of information geometry, a field that combines differential geometry with probability theory and statistics. He subsequently taught at the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University, earning the 2023 International Prize in Statistics for his contributions.

Both Luiz André Barroso and Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao made significant contributions in their respective fields, leaving a lasting impact on technology and statistics, respectively.

## 3. [Auroratone, a psychedelic 1940s film that helped WWII vets overcome PTSD](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38387775)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses Auroratone films, which were invented by psychologist Cecil A. Stokes in the 1940s as a form of cinematic synesthesia. The films combined soothing abstract visuals with popular music of the time, and they were found to have therapeutic effects on patients, including deep relaxation and emotional release. Bing Crosby contributed recordings for a third of the films and supported their distribution to soldiers during World War II. The process of creating the films involved cutting recorded melodies into short segments, splicing them into tape loops, and using radio waves to stimulate the formation of crystals on glass slides. The films were not only beneficial for PTSD sufferers, but also for individuals with various mental disorders, chronic migraines, and developmental delays. They were shown in department stores, churches, and even proposed for use in maternity wards. However, despite their popularity, the Guggenheim Museum did not show support for the Auroratone Foundation of America's efforts. Only one Auroratone film has survived to this day, but modern technology allows for the creation of a DIY approximation by pairing specific songs with audio visualizers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author argues that closing developer accounts due to fake reviews is inappropriate because it could be used as a way to eliminate competition by buying fake reviews for competitors. The author also suggests that the large revenue figures of these apps may indicate money laundering or fraud, and criticizes Apple for not being specific in their communications regarding this issue.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that the current power and control that Apple and Google have over app developers is a result of developers themselves enabling these companies. The author admits to building software that could be monetized as an app but refuses to give Apple or Google even more power and control. Despite this decision slowing down the development process, the author is still regularly releasing updates and enjoying the process. However, if financial constraints were to force the author to give in to the power of these gatekeepers, they would strongly dislike it.

## 8. [Git Branches: Intuition and Reality](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38393238)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of git branches and explores the difference between an "intuitive" notion of a branch and how git actually works. The author presents a diagram representing the physical metaphor of a branch of an apple tree, where only the offshoot commits are considered part of the branch. However, in git, a branch encompasses the entire history of previous commits. The article provides an example repository to demonstrate this difference. Despite the technical definition differing from the intuitive notion, the author highlights three ways in which the intuitive understanding aligns with practical usage of git. These include the process of rebasing and how merges and pull requests are handled. Overall, the article concludes that the intuitive idea of a branch is not entirely incorrect and can be useful in understanding certain git operations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article explains that branches are essentially pointers to commits, and they are refreshed when new commits are made. Branches are like wandering tags, and the chain of commits that make up a branch are linked by pointing back to their parent commit. The article emphasizes that branches don't have any special meaning beyond being a chain of related commits with a named entrypoint. Deleting a branch removes the named pointer to a commit, leaving only a chain of commits without a labeled branch. The use of branches like "master/dev/release" is a convention to keep an updated pointer on a chain of commits that contain important changes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article suggests a different way of thinking about Git's model of lineage. Instead of viewing lineage as progressing forward, the author suggests that it is more helpful to think about it in terms of backward pointers. Each commit points to its parent, allowing you to trace the entire history of a branch by following the parent links backwards. A "branch point" is where two chains of parent links converge. Merge commits, with multiple parents, indicate that two histories have fused into one.

## 9. [Three chips in and Google Tensor is on life support](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38344444)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article discusses Google's use of machine learning and AI in its Pixel smartphones. The original Pixel was the first Android phone to feature Google Assistant and AI-powered computational photography. Google had been using Qualcomm chips to power these AI and ML experiences, but with the launch of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro in 2021, Google introduced its first customized chip called Google Tensor. Their goal was to create their own chip to deliver new capabilities and keep up with advancements in ML. However, the article suggests that Google's efforts in developing customized chips have not been as ambitious as Apple's. The first three Tensor chips were semi-custom designs co-developed with Samsung. While Apple has been developing fully customized Arm-based CPUs and GPUs, Google's Tensor chips still use stock Arm components. The article also mentions that Google is rumored to be designing a fully customized Tensor chip to be fabricated by TSMC, but it is not expected to be ready until 2025. In the meantime, another Tensor chip from the current partnership with Samsung is anticipated.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that tensor hardware has mostly been disappointing in terms of general performance, but it may be different when it comes to machine learning (ML). The author mentions that ML has been a recent revolution and that in the case of the Pixel8, there was a difficult decision to make regarding running weaker, smaller models on the device or using the more powerful LLM models in the cloud for better results, albeit with slower performance and the need for an internet connection.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The individual is seeking clarification on AI/Machine learning chips. They believe these chips are essentially general-purpose microprocessors with additional instructions to enhance commonly used operations such as matrix multiplication. However, they admit to having some difficulty understanding the topic due to a mix of marketing information and heavy technical details.

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges that may arise after the eradication of polio. While the global health campaign has made significant progress in eliminating the disease, there are concerns about potential reintroductions of the virus from laboratory mishaps or inadequate vaccine supply. The article emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and efforts in order to prevent future outbreaks. Vaccination is the primary tool in eradicating polio, with both inactivated and oral poliovirus vaccines being used. The Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) has been highly effective in preventing polio, and it is cheaper and easier to administer compared to the inactivated vaccine. However, it is important to balance the risks of vaccine-derived polio outbreaks when using the OPV. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of sustained efforts in preventing and containing polio even after its official eradication.
