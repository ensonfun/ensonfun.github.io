## 1. [Money lessons without money: The financial literacy fallacy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43092390)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The article critiques the approach to teaching financial literacy in schools, arguing that it follows a pattern of educational fads that promise much but deliver little. Here are the main points:

1. **Ineffectiveness of Pure Knowledge**: The author compares teaching financial literacy without practical experience to teaching swimming with PowerPoint slides, suggesting that theoretical knowledge alone is insufficient for real-world application.

2. **Fundamental Educational Issues**: Before adding complex financial education, the author points out a more pressing issue: only 26% of eighth graders in the U.S. are proficient in basic math, indicating a foundational problem in education.

3. **Misplaced Priorities**: The article uses Parkinson's Law of Triviality to illustrate how schools focus on less critical issues like financial literacy curriculum while ignoring more fundamental educational shortcomings, likening it to discussing a bike shed's color while neglecting a nuclear reactor's design.

4. **Historical Context**: The author references past educational trends like the introduction of iPads, the "whole language" approach, and "new math," which all promised transformation but left educators and students disillusioned.

5. **Misunderstanding Behavioral Economics**: Financial literacy education often assumes that understanding financial concepts will lead to better financial decisions, ignoring psychological and social factors like impulse control, peer pressure, and the desire for social status which significantly influence financial behavior.

6. **College Debt Example**: The piece discusses how students take on large debts for college not because they misunderstand the math, but due to societal expectations, parental pressure, and an inability to grasp long-term financial commitments at a young age.

7. **Call for Real-World Experience**: The author concludes that while financial education has its place, it needs to be accompanied by practical, real-world experiences rather than just theoretical classroom learning to be truly effective.

In essence, the article advocates for a more realistic and behaviorally-informed approach to financial education, emphasizing practical experience over theoretical knowledge alone.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article critiques an argument against teaching financial literacy in schools by suggesting that similar logic could be used to question the relevance of other subjects like Home Economics or CPR. The author argues that using this logic, only subjects directly relevant to students' immediate interests would be taught, like video games or socializing. The piece highlights that not all students will excel in every subject taught, using English class as an example, but this doesn't justify removing these subjects from the curriculum. The overall point is that education should provide foundational knowledge for those interested, even if not all students will master or immediately apply the skills learned.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article critiques the idea that simply providing real-world experience is a straightforward solution to teaching life skills, particularly in an educational setting. It argues that while experience is a better teacher than traditional classroom learning, scaling real-world experience like starting millions of small businesses each year for educational purposes is impractical and potentially counterproductive if the experiences are negative. Instead, the article suggests using storytelling as a scalable method to impart valuable life lessons such as delayed gratification, the importance of saving, and distinguishing between self-confidence and vanity in financial decisions. This approach could be implemented early in a student's educational journey with less risk and investment.

## 2. ['The tyranny of apps': those without smartphones are unfairly penalised](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43137488)

**Total comment counts : 87**

### Summary

 The article discusses the growing necessity of using mobile apps for everyday activities in the UK, highlighting the challenges faced by individuals like Michael, who, despite owning a smartphone, opts out of using apps due to security concerns. Here are the key points:

- **Digital Exclusion:** Millions of people, particularly the elderly, those who can't afford smartphones, or those with outdated devices, are increasingly excluded from accessing deals, discounts, and essential services because these require app usage.

- **App Advantages:** Apps provide convenience (one-click access), push notifications to engage users, and are often considered more secure due to biometric verification capabilities. They also offer exclusive deals not available through other means.

- **Retail and Service Impact:** Retailers like Lidl, Asda, and others offer loyalty schemes and discounts exclusively through apps, potentially disenfranchising customers who cannot use these technologies. For instance, Lidl's loyalty program, Lidl Plus, is app-only, impacting those without smartphones.

- **Economic and Social Concerns:** The reliance on apps creates a digital divide, with critics like Ron Delnevo from the Payment Choice Alliance arguing that it's becoming an "expensive passport to participate" in society. This exclusion affects not just savings on purchases but also access to services like parking or event attendance.

- **Response from Companies:** Some companies like Lidl mention they still offer in-store promotions, but the trend towards app-centric engagement continues to grow, with more businesses moving towards app-only promotions or rewards.

- **Statistics:** According to Ofcom, about 8% of UK adults (around 4.5 million people) do not have a smartphone, with the figure rising to 28% for those aged 75 and above.

The article underscores the tension between technological advancement and inclusivity, pointing out how the push towards digital solutions might inadvertently marginalize a significant portion of the population.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the transition of a medical office from a user-friendly web interface for patient interaction to a less effective smartphone app, both developed by the same corporation but by different teams. Here are the key points:

1. **Transition from Web to App**: The old web interface was practical and efficient, designed seemingly with direct input from doctors. The new app, however, appears to have been developed with cost-saving in mind rather than user functionality.

2. **Development Issues**: The original development team was significantly reduced, with much of the work outsourced, leading to a breakdown in communication and quality control.

3. **User Experience**: The new app requires users to:
   - Close and reopen the app each time they want to perform an action.
   - Perform only one action before repeating the process due to the app's inability to handle errors properly. Instead of showing errors, the app displays a perpetual loading animation, masking the actual issues.

4. **Corporate Perspective**: Despite the app's flaws, corporate management claims the project is successful, likely because the client has paid for the service.

5. **User Workaround**: The author has to write messages on a PC, email them to themselves, and then copy-paste into the app due to its poor functionality.

The summary highlights the decline in software quality and user experience due to cost-cutting measures and poor management decisions within the corporation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges faced by individuals who frequently travel between countries, particularly in relation to using country-specific apps. The author mentions that:

- Their UK bank, Barclays, does not allow its app to be installed on a US iPhone with a US iCloud account.
- They cannot use Tesco's loyalty app or order from Starbucks or McDonald's in the UK due to regional app restrictions.
- Streaming services like Paramount Plus also pose problems; the US app detects when the user is in the UK, and they can't install the UK version.

The author points out that switching to a UK iCloud account would only invert the problem when they return to the US, making it difficult to manage digital services across borders.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the influence of suckless and their Stali Linux FAQ on the author's approach to software development and deployment. Initially, the author adhered to the common Linux practice of using shared libraries for all software. However, after learning about Stali Linux, which uses statically linked user space, the author reconsidered this approach:

- **Static vs. Dynamic Linking**: Stali Linux's use of static linking inspired the author to question the necessity of dynamic linking for every application. Static linking embeds all necessary libraries directly into the executable, reducing dependencies and potential version conflicts.

- **Practical Experience**: Previously, the author dealt with creating distribution packages or custom tarballs to manage library versions, which was cumbersome. The realization that this complexity was often unnecessary led to a change in practice.

- **Shift in Development Practice**: Post-discovery, the author started using static linking for their small CLI tools, finding it more straightforward for deployment. For cases where static linking wasn't feasible, AppImages were used as an alternative.

- **Modern Language Support**: The author notes that newer programming languages like Go default to static linking, which aligns well with the simplicity of deploying small applications.

- **Conclusion**: While acknowledging the benefits of dynamic linking in certain scenarios, the author advocates for static linking as a simpler default for software deployment, reducing the complexity traditionally associated with Linux application distribution.

### Summary

 **Summary of "Surface-Stable Fractal Dithering for Playdate"**

Rune Skovbo Johansen's Surface-Stable Fractal Dithering technique involves dither dots that adhere to 3D surfaces while adapting to view distance and zoom level. This article explores whether this technique is suitable for the Playdate, a handheld gaming device with a one-bit color screen and limited processing capabilities reminiscent of a 1995 PC:

1. **Practicality**: The article concludes that the technique isn't practical for Playdate due to its hardware constraints, which include no GPU and a basic CPU core. Simple 3D rendering is possible, but the complex calculations required for fractal dithering are too demanding.

2. **Implementation Details**: 
   - The dithering process requires brightness input and geometry texture coordinates (UVs) to ensure the pattern sticks to surfaces.
   - It uses derivatives of UVs in screen space to maintain a consistent dither pattern size on screen.
   - The technique involves complex math including singular value decomposition to adjust the dither pattern based on how quickly UVs change across the screen.

3. **Adaptation for Playdate**: 
   - Basic dithering methods like Bayer or Blue Noise patterns are more feasible for Playdate due to their simplicity.
   - Experiments showed that while fractal dithering could theoretically be implemented, the computational cost is significantly higher than what the Playdate can handle efficiently.

4. **Learning Outcome**: Despite the impracticality for Playdate, the author learned about software rasterizers, highlighting the educational value of exploring such techniques even if they are not immediately applicable.

The article includes references to external resources like videos and GitHub code repositories for further exploration of the technique. However, for Playdate, simpler dithering methods are recommended given the hardware limitations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that using tariffs to encourage manufacturing to return to the U.S. is misguided for several reasons:

1. **Lack of Infrastructure and Expertise**: The U.S. currently lacks the necessary knowledge and labor force to immediately and effectively shift manufacturing back from countries like China, India, Bangladesh, or Taiwan.

2. **High Manufacturing Costs**: The cost of manufacturing in the U.S. is significantly higher than in many other countries. Small tariffs of 10% or 25% are insufficient to offset these costs.

3. **Need for Extremely High Tariffs**: For manufacturing to return, tariffs would need to be extraordinarily high, potentially leading to global economic repercussions like a deep recession.

4. **Long-term Transition**: Even with high tariffs, the transition back to significant U.S. manufacturing would take decades.

The author expresses concern that the U.S. administration might be willing to impose such high tariffs, potentially causing widespread economic damage without achieving the intended results quickly.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses confusion over the benefits of tariffs in the U.S. The author questions how tariffs, which raise the price of imported goods, could be advantageous for American consumers since it primarily seems to benefit only a few domestic industries by reducing competition from foreign products.
