**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 Plants have the ability to detect and react to sound, according to scientific evidence. Studies have shown that plants exposed to different sounds, such as Buddhist chants or traffic noise, can have different growth patterns and produce stress compounds. Researchers have also found that certain vibrations caused by insects chewing on leaves can trigger plants to release defensive chemicals, making them less appealing to caterpillars. Additionally, plants may be able to "hear" water by detecting sound vibrations, which could have practical applications in agriculture and sewer maintenance. Some plants even produce their own sounds when under stress. The impact of human civilization on plants, particularly in noisy urban environments, is an area for further study.
