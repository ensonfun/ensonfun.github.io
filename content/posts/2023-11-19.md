## 7. [Meta disbanded its Responsible AI team](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38328355)

**Total comment counts : 38**

### Summary

 Meta (formerly Facebook) is reportedly dismantling its Responsible AI (RAI) team and reallocating resources to generative artificial intelligence. According to an internal post cited by The Information, most RAI members will join the generative AI product team, while others will work on Meta's AI infrastructure. The company has previously expressed a commitment to developing AI responsibly, but this reorganization suggests a shift in focus. Jon Carvill, representing Meta, stated that the company will continue to prioritize safe and responsible AI development and that team members will still support relevant cross-Meta efforts in this area. Earlier this year, the RAI team underwent a restructuring, including layoffs and reduced autonomy. These moves come as governments worldwide are striving to establish regulatory frameworks for AI development.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Meta is being considered the most ethical company as they are releasing their AI models to the public. Keeping AI models closed is seen as unethical as it limits people's ability to define "alignment" for themselves and makes them dependent on big companies' decisions and priorities.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author argues that having a separate "responsible AI team" is not an effective approach. They believe that all teams working on AI should be responsible and consider the ethical and legal dimensions of their work. Concentrating responsibility in one team creates a bottleneck, where they have to approve all AI work, or others can develop irresponsible AI without consequence. The author suggests that as AI becomes more important and mature, there should be a specific part of legal/compliance in big companies that focuses on AI ethics and trains everyone, rather than having a separate team. They compare this to how having an "innovation team" does not make a company truly innovative, and that innovation should be fostered everywhere within the company.

## 8. [Why aren't motherboards mostly USB-C by now? (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38326242)

**Total comment counts : 48**

### Summary

 The author of the article expresses frustration over the lack of USB-C ports on new desktop PCs and motherboards. They suggest that it would make more sense for all USB ports to be USB-C and use adapters for legacy components. The article also discusses the presence of legacy USB-A ports on modern PCs and questions why they still exist. The author mentions their own experiences with outdated technology and expresses confusion as to why USB-C has not been more widely distributed. They also highlight the benefits of USB-C, such as its reversible design, and discuss the potential cost and compatibility issues associated with transitioning to USB-C-only devices.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 According to the author's experience, USB C connectors are more fragile compared to USB A connectors. They find that when plugging in a USB C, it doesn't have a solid fit and feels vague. The author also mentions that USB C's smaller design may be suitable for mobile devices but not for desktops and their peripherals.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues against calling USB A "legacy" or a "relic" because many people still own devices that use USB A. The author challenges the idea that USB C is a suitable replacement, pointing out that finding a wired keyboard or mouse with a USB C plug is not easy. Instead of choosing between the two, the author suggests that computers should have both USB A and USB C ports to accommodate various devices. The author proposes that in the future, when USB C becomes more prevalent, a complete shift to USB C can be considered.
