The article concludes by mentioning a script that parses `/proc` without needing to spawn another bash subshell process.

## 3. [Higher-kinded bounded polymorphism in OCaml (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41096187)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 The article explains that although OCaml does not directly support higher-kinded polymorphism, it is still possible to express it using various methods. The article provides different ways of expressing higher-kinded polymorphism and also discusses how to avoid it. It introduces the concept of higher-order functions and demonstrates how they can be used to perform operations on collections of numbers. The article then discusses folding over lists of different types and introduces the idea of a parameterized record type to represent operations on lists of various types. It shows how the concept of a monoid can be used to generalize the folding operation. The article also discusses how different types of collections, such as files, strings, arrays, and sequences, can be folded over in the same way as lists. It introduces the concept of a higher-kind polymorphic type constructor and explains how it can be used to generalize the folding operation even further. The article concludes by mentioning that higher-kind type variables are not possible in OCaml and describes alternative approaches to achieve similar functionality.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Type aliases pose a challenge with type equality, as they turn it into a higher-order unification problem, which is not solvable. However, the practical implications of this issue, apart from slowing down the type-checker, are uncertain.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a code snippet written in F# and the author's confusion regarding the signature of a specific union case. The code line in question adds a union case called `List_name` to an extensible type called `app`. The author is unsure whether the parameter `x` in `(List_name x)` is supposed to be a list or a function.

## 4. [SVG Triangle of Compromise](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41070709)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article discusses the advantages and challenges of using SVGs on the web. SVGs can be referenced via an <img> tag and behave like any other image, allowing for caching and display customization. SVGs defined via an <svg> tag can be styled with CSS and inherit the text color of their parent element. They can also have hover states and dynamic styling applied via JavaScript. However, inline SVGs cannot be cached, so using an <iframe> to reference a separate HTML file containing the <svg> tag is suggested. This introduces the issue of determining the dimensions of the <iframe>, which can be solved with JavaScript. The article also mentions other ways to reference SVGs, such as using comments and webmentions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that the issue is not specifically related to the `<svg>` tag, but rather the difficulty of including HTML snippets from other files in HTML. The author suggests that if HTML allowed for easy inclusion of external HTML snippets, similar to using the `<svg>` tag, it would improve caching and performance. Although this functionality can be achieved with templating languages, the author believes that implementing it at the HTML layer would result in better caching by the browser.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses using sprite files for conditional styling of icons in order to avoid visible delays when changing between states. The author suggests using `<defs>` and `<use>` tags with SVG to create the sprite files. They bundle two-state icons into a single SVG file and use the `object-position: left/right` property on the `<img>` tag to switch between the variants. CSS animations can also be added for further customization.

 The article claims that reCAPTCHAv2 is not just a security service, but rather a way for Google to profit from image-labeling labor and tracking cookies for advertising and data. It estimates that over 13 years, 819 million hours of human time has been spent on reCAPTCHA, equivalent to at least $6.1 billion USD in wages. The article also suggests that Google has potentially earned $888 billion USD from cookies and $8.75-32.3 billion USD per sale of their labeled data set.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the cost and security of reCAPTCHAv2 and concludes that it is expensive and lacks security. The authors suggest that reCAPTCHAv2 and similar technologies should be deprecated. However, the reader disagrees with the conclusion, stating that reCAPTCHAv2 still offers some level of security against unsophisticated actors. They also argue that finding valid alternatives is necessary before abandoning captcha entirely. They liken the conclusion to claiming that locks offer no security because lockpicks exist, but acknowledge that both locks and captcha provide some security against unsophisticated actors.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the development of a new multiplayer editor for tasks and notes. The editor supports both text and outliner operations, with the outliner features turning the document into a large tree structure. The system syncs changes between clients and the server using an operation called "insmov" (move-or-insert). When a client is online, it can sync changes to the server, and the server sends back a list of all changes since the last sync. The client then undoes any previous insmov changes in its own changeset and applies the received changes in the correct order. The insmov tuple includes a parent and a previous sibling guid, allowing for sorting of tree operations. Most of the time, undoing operations is not necessary, except when there are insmov changes that the client is not aware of. This is more likely to occur when reconnecting to wifi after a long flight, rather than when updates are pushed in real-time.
