## 3. [Avoid blundering: 80% of a winning strategy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39902854)

**Total comment counts : 47**

### Summary

 The article discusses the idea that success in certain activities, such as chess and tennis, is not solely based on intentional goals and strategies, but also on avoiding mistakes or blunders. The author provides examples from chess games and amateur tennis matches to support this claim. They analyze their own chess games and find that players who made more blunders or errors were more likely to lose. The author concludes that in order to succeed in chess and other sports, it is important to focus on minimizing mistakes rather than solely relying on strategic moves.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the player who commits more blunders in chess games tends to lose more often. While the exact definition of a chess blunder is not clearly defined, the article provides an example from the Lichess UI where a move that decreases winning probability by more than 14% compared to the best move is considered a blunder. The winning probability is dependent on stockfish centipawns, but the analysis shows that a drop of 100 centipawns when the game is equal is considered a blunder. The main point is that a move is considered a blunder if it significantly affects the winning probability. Therefore, the analysis concludes that the number of blunders is highly correlated with the player's chances of winning.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that in activities like simracing and squash, winning is not solely dependent on being faster or stronger, but on being consistent and minimizing mistakes. The same principle applies to software development, where focusing on excellent testing, user feedback, monitoring, and rollouts can lead to more success than relying solely on brilliant engineering ideas. The article emphasizes the importance of investing in the fundamental aspects of building software rather than rewarding individual brilliance.
