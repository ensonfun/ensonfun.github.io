### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the evolution of termite-mimicking beetles and the factors that contribute to their uncanny resemblance to their hosts. The author ponders the lengthy evolutionary process and the selective pressures that drive these beetles to eventually mimic their host species perfectly. They also question why rove beetles excel at this mimicry compared to other species, such as army ants, suggesting that rove beetles may possess unique evolutionary abilities that allow them to mimic more effectively.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article suggests that termites and a termite mimicry species co-evolved over a long period of time. The early mimicry was not very effective, but neither were the termites' detection abilities. Through incremental steps over 100,000+ years, both species gradually evolved to believe in this mimicry. However, neither party can fully prevail in this model. They only gain marginal benefits in a predator/prey/host relationship, which affects the cyclical swings in the equilibrium outcome of which species is dominant. This dominance may shift in the next 1000 years.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a shift in particle systems in recent games towards a new style that combines point-based rendering with physics systems. Examples of this new style can be seen in games like Hogwarts, Forspoken, Starfield, AC6, and FF16. These games use particles as colored transparent points with physics, creating visually appealing effects while being computationally efficient. The author asks if anyone in the game development community has insight into this trend.

## 4. [Kagi Small Web](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37420281)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 Kagi Small Web has been launched as part of an effort to humanize the web. The term "small web" refers to the non-commercial aspect of the internet, where individuals can express themselves or share knowledge without seeking financial gain. The concept is reminiscent of the early, less commercialized days of the web. Kagi Small Web curates recently published content from the small web and surfaces it in search results. The initiative began in July and now features a curated list of nearly 6,000 genuine websites. The entire initiative, including the list of curated websites, is open-source and can be found on Kagi's GitHub. Kagi Small Web results are now integrated into the search index, providing a more diverse and unique flavor compared to traditional search engines. In addition, Kagi Small Web has launched a website that operates without JavaScript and allows users to appreciate posts or leave temporary public notes. The aim of the initiative is to bring a more humane experience to web search and promote genuine content over commercial clutter. Kagi Small Web also features emerging YouTube creators with fewer than 400k subscribers. Real-time updates can be obtained through the RSS feed, and API integration is available at a cost. Users are encouraged to contribute to the curated list and provide feedback and bug reports. The initiative seeks to highlight the human aspect of the web and revitalize it as a space for creativity, self-expression, and meaningful content.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author, Vlad, mentions that the RSS feed for their site broke but is now back up. He explains that he personally worked on the code for the site and admits that he is not a very skilled coder. Despite this, he is pleased with the site's ability to replace the need for discovery and connect with different writers. He believes there is hope in this concept and that it improves search quality and diversity. The article provides links to the list of included websites and recent posts.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of the "small web" and the impermanence of content on it. It mentions that Kagi, a website, will soon remove its notes, highlighting how content on the small web is transient. The article suggests that Kagi may not want to moderate or store notes permanently, but many small websites do preserve their content. The author argues that content on large platforms also often disappears, even when the creator has not forgotten about it. It concludes by stating that small web websites created by caring individuals have the potential to be more permanent.

## 5. [North Korean campaign targeting security researchers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37420831)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has provided an update on security researcher targeting by North Korean threat actors. TAG has been tracking and disrupting campaigns from these actors who have used 0-day exploits to target security researchers. Recently, TAG discovered a new campaign with similarities to the previous one, and at least one actively exploited 0-day has been used to target security researchers. The vulnerability has been reported to the affected vendor and is being patched. TAG warns the security research community to stay vigilant, as government-backed attackers may target them. The threat actors have used social media sites to build rapport with their targets and then moved to encrypted messaging apps. They send a malicious file containing a 0-day exploit in a popular software package to the targeted researchers. The exploit shellcode sends information back to an attacker-controlled domain. In addition, the threat actors have developed a tool that downloads debugging symbols but also has the ability to download and execute arbitrary code. TAG advises taking precautions if the tool has been downloaded or run. TAG shares its research findings to enhance the safety and security of Google's products, adds identified websites and domains to Safe Browsing, and sends alerts to targeted Gmail and Workspace users. They aim to raise awareness, improve threat hunting capabilities, and strengthen user protections across the industry.

### Top 1 Comment Summary
