## 1. [I maintain a 17 year old ThinkPad](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43564111)

**Total comment counts : 140**

### Summary

 Nassim Nicholas Taleb differentiates between fragile and robust systems, introducing the concept of antifragile systems as well. In the context of laptops, he compares an older IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad with a newer MacBook. The Thinkpad, despite its age, remains functional and user-friendly due to its durable design, modular components, and compatibility with various operating systems. Its open ecosystem supports easy repairs and upgrades, aligning with Taleb's Lindy Effect, which suggests older, non-perishable items have a greater chance of longevity.

In contrast, the MacBook, while powerful and efficient, is considered fragile because its components are soldered and not easily replaced. The integrated design creates a higher risk of total failure from a single component malfunction. Additionally, the proprietary nature of Apple hardware and software results in limited repair options and a built-in obsolescence once official support ends. While the MacBook has impressive capabilities, its lack of modularity and higher susceptibility to failure make it less resilient compared to the robust, long-lasting Thinkpad.

The author concludes that while the T450 remains a viable option for daily use, older models may compromise too much in terms of features and compatibility with modern requirements. The author also mentions still using an old X240 occasionally.

## 2. [US Administration announces 34% tariffs on China, 20% on EU](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43561253)

**Total comment counts : 171**

### Summary

 Wall Street experienced its worst day since 2020 following Donald Trump's announcement of extensive global tariffs, which include a 10% tariff on most countries, including the UK. In response, Canada announced a 25% tariff on specific US vehicles, while the UK prepared a comprehensive list of potential tariffs on US goods. The tariffs are expected to impact American workers and businesses, leading to fears of a retaliatory trade war that could push the US economy towards recession. In an extended Q&A on his flight, Trump reassured that the situation would "work out" and emphasized the importance of domestic production to avoid tariffs. Meanwhile, the WTO has reduced its global trade forecasts due to these tariffs and has faced funding restrictions from the US government, complicating its ability to mediate trade rules. Concerns from workers at automotive plants in Canada highlighted the potential consequences on jobs and pensions. Overall, investor sentiment declined sharply as the risk of global economic instability heightened.

## 4. [An open source, self-hosted implementation of the Tailscale control server](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43563396)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses Headscale, an open-source, self-hosted implementation of the Tailscale control server, which allows users to create a private network (tailnet) based on the Tailscale VPN using Wireguard technology. Tailscale itself is mostly open-source except for its GUI clients and control server. Headscale is designed for self-hosters and hobbyists, focusing on personal or small organization use. The project encourages community contributions and has established development standards, including use of the Go programming language and various tools for code quality. The maintainers, including one employed by Tailscale, collaborate to guide the project's direction while serving the self-hosting community. Documentation is provided for setup, contribution guidelines, and features. The article emphasizes the importance of following specific coding rules and testing procedures during contributions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses concern over the lack of progress in security features, specifically Tailnet lock and server audits, in the Tailscale repository. They are uncertain about trusting Tailscale as a crucial part of their infrastructure, given its reliance on creating tunnels through firewalls and allowing users to control traffic routing. While Headscale appears effective in bypassing firewalls and performing NAT traversal, the author questions whether it can provide adequate security to compensate for these bypasses. They highlight a potential risk of Headscale being misused to expose local networks without proper user oversight, especially in the absence of server code audits.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author proposes that Headscale implement a peering or federating feature between instances, particularly after an ACL rework. They suggest using an IPv6-only overlay network within the unique local address (ULA) range to address the problem of address collisions. Their plan involves allocating 20 low bits for device addresses (allowing for approximately 1 million devices) and using 101 high bits as a hash of the server's public key. Communication between nodes would be managed through policies and ACLs based on the public keys of federated instances. However, the maintainer, kradalby, indicated that this idea is currently out of scope for the project, as noted in a GitHub issue.

## 5. [Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43523220)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 The article discusses a unique CSS technique for creating blurry image placeholders (LQIPs) without complicating HTML markup. It introduces a single custom property that allows for the encoding of LQIPs using a compact integer format, minimizing the need for complex wrappers, attributes, or JavaScript. The approach involves encoding image data into a 20-bit integer, allowing for nearly two million configurations. It simplifies the LQIP to a base color and six brightness components arranged in a grid, utilizing the Oklab color space for balanced results. The author mentions that although prior techniques like BlurHash and progressive images exist, they often come with added markup complexity. The new method allows for encoding the LQIP as a custom property and decoding it purely using CSS functions such as bit manipulation, enabling immediate rendering of blurred placeholders with minimal code clutter. The article concludes with a brief overview of the implementation logic and simplicity of the new encoding scheme.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article praises the creative use of CSS, but provides a suggestion to improve performance. It advises against using attribute selectors on the style attribute, such as `[style*="--lqip:"]`, as this can lead to performance issues by forcing browsers to compute the string version of the style attribute on every recalculation. Instead, it recommends using a separate boolean attribute or a class to avoid these performance pitfalls, suggesting the use of `<div lqip style="--lqip: ...">` as a better approach.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an aesthetic issue related to a project involving encoded space exploration. It notes that sliders used to navigate the Low-Quality Image Placeholders (LQIP) often "flash" during use. The author suggests that this flashing could be reduced if the base color were encoded in the high bits rather than the low bits, although this point is primarily a minor critique rather than a significant concern for the overall project.

## 7. [Dijkstra On the foolishness of "natural language programming"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43564386)

**Total comment counts : 49**

### Summary

 The article critiques the concept of "natural language programming," arguing that the desire for machines to understand human languages stems from a misunderstanding of the formal symbolism required in programming. Since the inception of computing, there has been frustration with the strictness of programming languages, which, while initially seen as burdensome, actually serve to prevent errors and inconsistencies. The author posits that high-level programming languages improved error handling but still required careful thought and accuracy in instruction.

The push for machines to comprehend natural language may seem like it would reduce the burden on users, but the article suggests that it could significantly complicate communication and increase the workload on both sides of the interface. Historical examples from mathematics illustrate that relying on verbal or informal communication can lead to stagnation and inefficiency, while formal systems have enabled progress and clearer expression.

The piece concludes that the formalities of programming should be viewed as beneficial tools that streamline communication and learning, rather than as constraints. The author highlights that the inherent "naturalness" of human languages can often lead to nonsense that formal language systems help to eliminate, ultimately advocating for the continued use of formal symbols in programming for their clarity and effectiveness.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to convert code into natural language descriptions. It questions whether this process can accurately capture the behavior and requirements of the code while retaining enough detail for reconstruction. The author notes that many applications demonstrated using vibe-coding tend to be simple, suggesting that managing complexity and precision becomes challenging in natural language. They compare this to legal language, implying that precise language serves a purpose beyond just being difficult to understand.
