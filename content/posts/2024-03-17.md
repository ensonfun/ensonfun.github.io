## 1. [The return of the frame pointers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39731824)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 The article discusses the issue of broken debuggers and profilers and specifically focuses on flame graphs. It explains that when flame graphs appear fine at first glance, there can still be samples in the wrong place and missing frames. The problem arises when the default libc (C library) used in a system is compiled without frame pointers, causing a partial stack that lacks application frames. This issue affects other types of profiling as well, such as off-CPU flame graphs. The article also mentions that Fedora and Ubuntu are releasing versions that fix this problem by compiling libc with frame pointers by default. The x86-64 ABI documentation is referenced to explain how frame pointers are used in stack walking techniques. The article mentions a change made to gcc in 2004 to stop generating frame pointers, which had performance benefits but also broke debuggers and profilers. The author shares their experience of encountering this issue in Java and developing a fix for the JVM. They explain that they compiled their own libc with frame pointers and worked with Canonical to have a prebuilt version for Ubuntu. The article concludes by mentioning that the overhead of adding frame pointers is usually minimal, except in rare cases where stack traces are extremely deep.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recalls their time in college when the omission of stack frame pointers became popular in the early 2000s. Despite studying computer sciences in a poor country with outdated computers, they were able to work on interesting projects involving low-level data structures, compilers, assembly-code numerical routines, and a device driver for Minix. Initially, they would use gdb to debug their programs, but when "-fomit-frame-pointer" became popular, stack traces became harder to understand, making debugging more difficult. As a result, the author turned to using Python for most of their work, even though it was less efficient. However, this decision proved beneficial for their future endeavors.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's satisfaction with the mention of Fedora because of their efforts to enable frame pointers in the entire distribution. There is a misconception that frame pointers have a significant impact on performance, but the actual measured overhead is less than 1%. The benefits of enabling frame pointers outweigh this minimal overhead.

## 2. [LLM4Decompile: Decompiling Binary Code with LLM](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39733275)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article discusses the development of a large language model (LLM) dedicated to decompiling binary code. The objective is to create an open-source LLM that can decompile code and assess its capabilities. A dataset of assembly-source pairs is compiled using different configurations, and the DeepSeek-Coder model is fine-tuned using this dataset. An evaluation benchmark, Decompile-Eval, is constructed to test the re-compilability and re-executability of the decompiled code. The article explains the steps involved in the decompilation evaluation and highlights the importance of re-compilability and re-executability in validating the decompilation process. The LLM4Decompile includes models of various sizes and parameters, with some trained without prior knowledge of optimization levels. The article provides instructions on how to use the model, including preprocessing and decompilation steps. Future plans include expanding the dataset and adding support for more languages/platforms and settings. The code repository for the decompiler is licensed under the MIT License.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of "re-executability" in relation to decompilation. It explains that re-executability refers to the ability to re-compile the decompiled output and run test cases to assess if the decompilation preserved the program logic and behavior. The article emphasizes that re-compilability and re-executability are essential for usable and robust decompilation. However, the effectiveness of re-executability is questioned. A figure showing the "re-executability" results is provided in the linked image.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is expressing fascination with the idea presented in the article but raises concerns about the reliability of the output. They question whether it would be difficult to identify hallucinations due to the possibility of recompiling producing different machine code. The author suggests incorporating ways for the language model to report its confidence in certain sections when generating output. They believe that while the idea is amazing, there could potentially be stumbling blocks that would require human confirmation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the purity of electronic grade silicon (EG-Si), stating that it is 99.9999999% pure, which means there is only one impurity atom for every 10 million silicon atoms. However, the reader believes that it should actually be one impurity atom for every billion (10^9) silicon atoms to truly be considered "nine nines pure." The reader compares this to a scenario where there is one impurity atom for every 100 (10^2) silicon atoms, which would be considered 99% pure or "two nines pure."

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that silicon is an excellent material for semiconductors due to its low band gap energy between the valence and conduction bands. When electricity is applied, the outermost valence electrons are knocked off, making silicon conductive. When the energy is removed, the valence electrons return, making it non-conductive. Additionally, silicon is abundant and inexpensive.

## 5. [How a Solar Revolution in Farming Is Depleting Groundwater](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39730784)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 Farmers in hot, arid regions are increasingly using low-cost solar pumps to irrigate their fields, reducing dependence on fossil fuels. However, this technology is depleting underground water reserves, known as aquifers, around the world. The state of Rajasthan in India is a pioneer in solar pumps, with over 100,000 farmers using them to water more than a million acres of land. As a result, water tables are rapidly declining, with some underground rocks drying up to 400 feet below ground. This trend is not limited to Rajasthan, as solar pumps are spreading in water-starved regions in India, Africa, and other areas. While solar pumps initially appeared beneficial for farmers by improving agriculture and food security, they are now threatening already vulnerable aquifers. This solar-powered hydrological revolution is causing an environmental crisis, as underground water reserves are being emptied. In the past, artificial irrigation relied on reservoirs and canals, but many systems have reached their limits. As a result, farmers are turning to underground aquifers, which currently provide 43% of the world's irrigation water. However, withdrawals from aquifers exceed recharge from rainfall. Declines in water reserves have been observed in countries like India, Iran, Afghanistan, Spain, Mexico, the US, Chile, and Saudi Arabia. Groundwater depletion poses a global threat to food security, but policymakers are promoting solar power as a solution, further exacerbating the problem.

 In North Texas, some farmers are facing challenges with water scarcity. They are extracting water from a depleted aquifer, which is becoming increasingly salty. As a result, they are adapting by growing crops that are tolerant to salt. Additionally, the ground is sinking due to the drainage of the aquifer. This situation is concerning and has noticeable effects on the farming community.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the practicality of using solar power for irrigation. The author states that to water 10 acres of orchard in northern California, a 25 hp well pump is needed, which requires about 2 kW per acre. They estimate that a typical irrigation cycle would require 20-40 kWh per acre, and should be repeated every 10 days. The author suggests that in theory, a 1 kW solar panel charging a 20 kWh battery for 10 days should be sufficient to water 1 acre for a whole summer season, but the capital cost would be around $20,000 per acre, which is considered economically unviable. The author also mentions that they currently pay about $400 per acre, per year with PG&E power.

## 8. [Mintlify GitHub read/write token leak](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39730255)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 In this article, the co-founder of Han Wang discusses a security incident that occurred on March 1st. They received an email raising concerns about the security of their endpoints, leading them to investigate. They discovered unusual requests to their servers originating from an unrecognized device, which were successful in accessing sensitive API endpoints. It was determined that the actor behind these requests had unauthorized access to their endpoints using private admin access tokens. The company took immediate action by revoking all GitHub token access, rotating admin access tokens, implementing stricter security measures, and patching the vulnerability that led to the exposure of admin access tokens. They have also partnered with third-party cybersecurity vendors for investigation and have implemented additional security measures. The company decided to implement these measures before making a public announcement to ensure the security of their users. The article reassures users that no further action is required on their part and emphasizes the company's dedication to transparency, security, and user trust. Contact information is provided for any concerns or questions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article recounts their experience as a Mintlify customer 6 months ago. They found the onboarding process to be strange because the Github app asked for permissions to access all their repositories, without providing an option to limit the access. The author only wanted to grant access to their docs repository, not their app repository. They had to manually dig through Mintlify's settings page to revoke the permission after completing the onboarding process. 

The author also discusses their belief that customer OAuth tokens should not have the access token stored in the database, but only the refresh token. They suggest that when API access is needed, a new access token can be obtained using the refresh token and client secret. This approach adds an extra layer of security because an attacker would also need access to the client secret, which ideally should not be stored in the database.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article mentions that they are biased because Mintlify sponsors one of their open source projects. They state that they have been happy with Mintlify and are considering using it for other projects. The author believes that Mintlify helps them write better documentation and organize their project better. They also mention receiving an email from Mintlify and finding nothing suspicious in their git history or GitHub activity. The author acknowledges that Mintlify is a small business and believes they are handling the situation well.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a simulation that demonstrates a phenomenon called the "gravothermal catastrophe" which occurs in globular star clusters. In this simulation, particles relax to thermal equilibrium but some particles have high enough energy to escape, causing the remaining particles to become more tightly bound and the cluster to shrink. However, in actual star clusters, this catastrophe is prevented by three body collisions that cause binary stars to form. These binary stars inject energy into passing stars, reheating the cluster and preventing runaway evaporation. The simulation discussed in the article does not account for the formation of such binaries.
