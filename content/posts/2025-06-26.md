## 3. [OpenAI charges by the minute, so speed up your audio](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44376989)

**Total comment counts : 49**

### Summary

 To improve OpenAI transcription speed and reduce costs, simply increase the audio playback speed to 2x or 3x using ffmpeg before transcription. This method maintains quality while minimizing token usage and wait times. The author discovered this while attempting to summarize a 40-minute talk by Andrej Karpathy, initially facing issues with YouTube’s auto-transcription. After realizing an outdated version of yt-dlp was to blame, they experimented with audio speeding as a workaround for API limits, successfully summarizing the talk and uncovering an efficient transcription hack.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Transcribing a talk by Andrej is challenging due to his fast speaking speed, which exceeds 1.5 times that of a typical speaker. It's recommended to set YouTube playback speed to 1x for better comprehension. To create a concise version of the audio, use an FFmpeg command that removes silence and replaces it with brief pauses. This can reduce a 39-minute talk to about 31 minutes, though the quality of transcription from the shortened audio may not have been evaluated.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the benefits of taking time to fully engage with content rather than skimming or relying on summaries. The author shares a personal experience where watching a talk in full, rather than reading a summary, sparked numerous ideas and insights. They compare the value of immersive experiences, such as attending talks in person or reflecting deeply during walks, to lighter alternatives. The key takeaway is that a slower, more deliberate approach often leads to better understanding and thought development.
