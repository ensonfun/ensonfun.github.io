## 5. [Sad clown paradox](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38198417)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The sad clown paradox refers to the association between comedy and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety in performers. Early life for those affected is characterized by deprivation and isolation, and comedy becomes a release for tension and suppressed rage. Psychological experiments have shown that comedians possess certain behavioral traits not found in regular actors. Comedy serves as a coping mechanism to hide trauma and gain acceptance. Humor develops from a young age and can be fostered by parental behavior. Comedians often show humorous tendencies early in life and may have been identified as the "class clown" in school. Comics use humor as a way to gain acceptance and approval. Comedians frequently enter the industry through musical performance. They tend to be raised in distant and disjointed family settings, leading to feelings of neglect and alienation. Comedians use humor as a way to obtain social contact and relate to others from a distance. Humor serves as a medium for self-preservation and allows the individual to control uncomfortable situations. Comedians often suffer from feelings of unworthiness and use humor as a defense mechanism. They have a greater sense of responsibility and feel obligated to protect others. Comedians have a tendency to be critical of others' motives and fear the longevity of their popularity. They often face depression and anxiety alongside their work. Comedians display high levels of psychotic personality traits and tend to have cyclothymic temperament. The sad clown paradox is exemplified by the joke about a depressed patient who turns out to be the clown himself. This joke has become an internet meme.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author attended a clowning masterclass in France and realized that their philosophy of needing to be perfect in order to be accepted by others was wrong. In clowning, people are liked for their flaws and the act of acknowledging and embracing failure is a powerful way to connect with others. The author believes that making mistakes and being real is what truly allows people to connect with each other. Comedians, who often use failure in their acts, possess psychological traits that enable them to connect with others in a unique way. The author was initially upset to realize that their perfectionism was hindering their performance, but ultimately found beauty in discovering new ways to present themselves on stage.

## 7. [Researchers uncover the fastest semiconductor yet](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38201624)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 Scientists have discovered a new semiconductor made from a molecule called Re6Se8Cl2, which is composed of rhenium, selenium, and chlorine. This semiconductor overcomes the speed limits of traditional semiconductors by utilizing quasiparticles known as acoustic exciton-polarons. These quasiparticles can travel farther and faster than electrons in silicon, potentially revolutionizing processing speeds in electronic devices. While Re6Se8Cl2 is made from a rare element, rhenium, the researchers believe there is a possibility of finding alternatives made from more abundant materials. The new semiconductor could have applications in light detectors and computing. The findings were published in the journal Science.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a problem with the compound Re6Se8Cl2, which contains the rare element rhenium. The rarity of rhenium makes the compound expensive and unlikely to be used in commercial products. However, the author argues that while rhenium is rare, it can be extracted from minerals already being mined. They also point out that only small amounts of rhenium are needed for high-performance semiconductors. The author suggests that the main costs in production are not in the substrates, but in intellectual property and processing. They believe that even if silicon, a commonly used material, were as expensive as gold, it would not significantly impact the cost of high-end CPUs.

## 8. [i386 Assembly Language trick for storing data in .text](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38201914)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The author of the article discusses their approach to storing strings in a position-independent way without using a Global Offset Table (GOT) or exporting large files. They describe embedding the strings with the executable code and jumping over them, using specific opcodes to push the string address on the stack and execute a jump instruction. They also mention a technique to calculate the length of the string by subtracting the offset of a label from the return address. The author shares a "Hello world" test as a proof of concept and mentions that this technique will be implemented in their project, Meow5.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the use of the return stack mechanism in newer processors to optimize calls and returns. The mechanism involves holding 16 entries in a cache called the Return Stack Buffer (RSB), which is designed to cover the call depth of most programs. However, if there are more than 16 nested calls and returns in rapid succession, performance may degrade. The article also mentions the use of return trampolines, known as "retpolines," to protect against speculative execution and mitigate vulnerabilities such as Spectre variant 2. It suggests that CPUs with Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (Enhanced IBRS) available in hardware should use this feature instead of retpoline for better efficiency.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the reverse engineering of programs created for a 32-bit RISC ISA called SH4, which uses 16-bit instructions. As a result, the ISA is limited in its ability to load more than 8 bits of arbitrary immediate data into a register, requiring multiple instructions to perform this task. This leads to functions having large blocks of data at the end or in the middle to load constant values and pointers. The author notes that this is common in programs targeting SH4 and did not realize it might be unusual for other CPUs. The article also mentions that using 16-bit instructions in SH4 doubles the effective size of the instruction cache and makes dual pipelines easier to implement, which reportedly served as inspiration for thumb mode on ARM, another 32-bit ISA with 16-bit instructions.

## 9. [On-Crash Backtraces in Swift](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38198638)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the new features in the Swift 5.9 release aimed at debugging code. These features include an out-of-process crash handler, the ability to trigger the debugger for just-in-time debugging, and concurrency-aware backtracing. Previously, when a program crashed, users only received a basic message. Now, the new release provides more detailed crash reports on Linux by default, while on macOS they need to be manually enabled. The article also explains how the interactive crash handler works and provides instructions for configuring and using it. The backtracer in Swift 5.9 is concurrency-aware and offers options for improved readability, such as limiting the number of frames and skipping system frames and irrelevant symbols. The new debugging options are helpful for diagnosing and resolving issues in Swift programs.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the methods for analyzing crash logs on different operating systems. It mentions that on Apple platforms or Windows, you can use the built-in crash reporter, but on Linux, the options are limited. However, on modern Linux distributions, you can simply use the command "coredumpctl debug" to load the core dump into gdb for analysis. It also mentions the possibility of automatically downloading debug symbols for libraries loaded during the crash, depending on the setup of debuginfod.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author mentions porting the Swift compiler to a Debian package using the Ubuntu package. They are surprised that Debian is not officially supported for Swift on Linux servers, but Ubuntu is.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article provides several strong opinions and recommendations for creating a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). It emphasizes the importance of commitment to the development and maintenance of the DSL. The article advises against allowing escape hatches or arbitrary functionality in the host language, as they can disrupt backwards compatibility and make maintaining DSL code difficult. It suggests using an LR parser generator instead of a PEG for better compatibility. The article highlights the value of supporting static analysis and the need for a language server with essential features like highlighting, auto-completion, and error hints. It also emphasizes the importance of reproducibility, advocating for deterministic languages and preserving production context. The article recommends extensive unit and regression testing. Additionally, it introduces the use of RAG to assist with documentation and script generation, and encourages iterative improvement based on error feedback. The author plans to explore the possibility of a separate, syntax-friendly for easier code generation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that one of the easiest ways to define a Domain Specific Language (DSL) is by implementing it within the host language itself. While not all programming languages support this approach, some do. This method provides numerous benefits, such as simplified implementation, safety, and support from the host language's compiler, IDE, and tooling. The article contrasts this approach with combining existing languages, like integrating OCL into another language, which is more complex and lacks the inherent support of the host language.
