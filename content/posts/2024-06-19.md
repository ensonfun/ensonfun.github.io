### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article talks about the author's experience as a student in Craig Hickman's Digital Arts class at the University of Oregon in 1986. The author developed a color paint program inspired by MacPaint on a Graphics Frame Store system that communicated with a Mac 128K computer via a serial port. The frame store had basic graphics primitives and drew images based on received commands. The author does not remember the exact name of the frame store, but it had 8-bit color and "Vector" as part of its name, despite using raster CRT displays instead of vector displays. It highlights Craig Hickman's role as an early pioneer in using computer color graphics for art.

## 2. [Off-path TCP hijacking in NAT-enabled Wi-Fi networks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40723150)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses a security flaw in router firmware that exposes a vulnerability in routers' Network Address Translation (NAT) mapping handling. This flaw can be exploited by attackers to bypass TCP's built-in randomization and intercept Wi-Fi TCP traffic. The attack involves hijacking TCP connections between victims and servers, allowing attackers to carry out various malicious activities such as SSH denial of service attacks, FTP private file downloads, and HTTP cache pollution. The researchers tested 67 mainstream routers from 30 manufacturers and found that 52 routers were susceptible to the attack. They have notified affected manufacturers and have received positive responses from some, who are actively working on fixing the vulnerability. The article also suggests three countermeasures to mitigate this attack.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a CVE-2022-32296 attack, which is detailed in a whitepaper. The vulnerability lies in Double-Hash Port Selection (DHPS, IETF RFC 6056). It has been fixed in Linux 5.17.9 and above using a variant of DHPS. The article also mentions specific configurations in the Linux sysctl and Firefox, such as enabling Only HTTPS to prevent JavaScript from performing unwanted actions. The article includes additional sources for more information on the subject.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses a potential security issue related to WiFi networks. They argue that the impact of this issue is not significant because it requires the attacker and the victim to be connected to the same router via the same WiFi network. In this scenario, the attacker can already intercept data from other clients on the network, making the proposed attack less significant. The author suggests that it is easier and faster to spoof packets and perform other types of attacks once the attacker has access to the same network. However, they acknowledge that there might be a potential denial of service attack in cases where the victim and the attacker are in different WiFi networks or are configured to be isolated from each other.

The author questions what would happen if someone with ulterior motives manages the AI in the future, pointing to the potential for harm similar to that seen in certain industries today. The author suggests that solving the issue of creating safe business practices and eliminating incentive structures that promote unsafe practices would mitigate much of the societal harm currently present. Without addressing this broader issue, the author expresses doubt in confidently creating a safe AI and mistrusts claims made without such consideration, as they may stem from either ignorance or malicious intent.

## 8. [Monitoring marine litter from space](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40726426)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 A new study funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) has proven that satellites can be used to monitor plastic litter in the ocean. The study used historical satellite images of the Mediterranean Sea to scan for patches of floating plastic debris, known as "litter windrows." Thousands of windrows were detected, allowing for the creation of the most comprehensive map of marine litter pollution to date. The researchers believe that this monitoring technique can be used globally to identify polluted areas, guide cleanup efforts, and study the sources and pathways of marine litter. While the current satellite sensor was not specifically designed for plastic detection, the researchers suggest that the development of a dedicated sensor could greatly improve detection capabilities. In addition to monitoring plastic pollution, the researchers believe that this methodology can also be applied to monitor other floating matter, such as oil spills or lost cargo.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

The article introduces the new Introspection generator, which generates metadata about types, and discusses its performance benefits.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In this article, the author emphasizes the importance of not directly serializing the entire game state when creating savegame systems. They recommend decoupling the saved data from the game logic and maintaining a clear boundary between the two. It is advised to keep the saved state minimal and reconstruct or default-initialize the rest of the data after loading. The author also suggests resisting the urge to overengineer savegame systems as they can be a trap for unnecessary complexity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes the author's experience with using a simple code for saving/loading objects in personal projects. The code includes an interface called IStashy, which has methods for saving, loading, deleting, and getting new IDs for objects. The implementations of this interface have been stable over time. The objects are serialized as JSON and stored in a folder named after their type. The author also mentions some workarounds for potential issues, such as marking obsolete properties instead of removing them, handling new Boolean properties with default values, and converting non-serializable types into serializable types before saving.
