## 3. [Parallel ./configure](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43799396)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 In 2025, a developer expresses frustration with existing build configuration tools like Autoconf and CMake, which fail to utilize the full potential of modern multi-core CPUs, causing long configuration times. The author proposes a new parallel approach using a Makefile to run configuration tests concurrently, drastically improving efficiency. By generating independent makefile fragments for compiler flags and merging them, the process becomes significantly faster. A proof-of-concept project demonstrates this method, achieving up to 802% CPU utilization, showcasing a substantial performance enhancement compared to traditional configuration steps.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the problem of developers lazily copying configuration scripts from older projects, leading to outdated checks in modern codebases. This results in unnecessary verifications for things like integer size or specific headers, even when the code only targets common architectures like x86 and ARM with compilers like GCC or Clang. Consequently, the codebase may inconsistently use types like int64_t without proper validation in the configure script.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a modified build system where the configuration step is integrated into the make process. Instead of separating the "configure" and "make" steps, the author generates a Makefile or ninja file during configuration that allows for simultaneous detection of compiler definitions and building the executable. This approach maintains similar behavior to traditional methods but enables interleaving configuration and build tasks, improving efficiency. The author did not fully utilize this interleaving but acknowledges its potential benefits.
