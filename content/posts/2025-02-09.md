**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 **Summary:**

The article describes the historical city of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire located in what is now Mexico City. Built in the 16th century on an island in Lake Texcoco, Tenochtitlan was a highly organized city with a population of around 200,000, making it one of the largest cities in the world at that time. It featured a grid layout with planned neighborhoods, canals for transportation, and significant structures like the Templo Mayor and Emperor Motecuhzoma's palace. The city was an economic and cultural hub, with markets selling goods from across the empire and beyond. 

The Mexica people engineered complex water management systems, including a dike to control lake salinity and chinampas (floating gardens) for agriculture, which were crucial for the city's growth. However, after the Spanish conquest, Tenochtitlan was largely dismantled, with its stones reused for new constructions, and the lake was drained. The article also mentions the New Fire Ceremony, a significant Aztec ritual, and acknowledges the extensive research and contributions from various experts in reconstructing the city's historical appearance. The images accompanying the article are available under a Creative Commons license, requiring attribution to the author, Thomas Kole, for the historical visualizations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article critiques an analysis by TFA (The Fine Article) about the performance of two versions of code, likely shader code. The critique points out that TFA concludes one version is superior but only shows the machine code generation (codegen) for the better-performing version. The critic argues that to strengthen TFA's argument, it should also show the codegen for the supposedly less efficient version to clearly demonstrate why it performs worse, specifically highlighting the unnecessary multiplications and additions that slow it down.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses concerns about how the `if` statement in programming can either force an actual branch in execution or not, depending on compiler optimizations. The author expresses a preference for syntax that clearly distinguishes between branching and non-branching conditionals:

1. **Branching Uncertainty**: The unpredictability of whether an `if` statement will result in a branch causes developers to sometimes opt for more costly operations like mix/lerp to avoid potential branching.

2. **Desire for Clear Syntax**: The author appreciates that a straightforward ternary operator (`v = x > y ? a : b;`) works but highlights the confusion when `if` might or might not branch. 

3. **Proposed Solution**: To address this, the author suggests having two distinct keywords or syntaxes:
   - A **branch-if** that explicitly allows branching and could warn if unnecessary.
   - A **non-branching-if** that would fail to compile if the compiler cannot optimize it to avoid branching. 

This would provide clarity and control over performance-critical code where branching impacts are significant.

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the illegal sand extraction activities in Brazil, particularly focusing on Rio de Janeiro, where a powerful militia led by Luis Antonio da Silva Braga, alias "Zinho," has been exploiting sand resources for profit. This group, known as Bonde do Zinho, not only deals in sand but has ties with local politicians and uses heavy machinery to extract sand illegally, impacting both the environment and local communities. The sand is used primarily in construction, and its illegal extraction is lucrative due to minimal oversight and the difficulty in distinguishing between legal and illegal sand. This activity leads to environmental degradation, contributes to the irregular real estate market, and has been linked to violent crimes, including the murder of a Rio councilwoman who opposed these practices. 

The issue extends beyond Brazil, with similar problems in Colombia, where sand trafficking has been associated with political corruption and violence, and in Mexico, where corrupt officials protect illegal operations. The article highlights the broader implications of sand trafficking, including its environmental impact, economic consequences, and the challenge of regulating this often overlooked form of organized crime.

## 6. [Noether's Theorem Revolutionized Physics](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42972982)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the pivotal work of Emmy Noether, a mathematician who in 1918 developed what is now known as Noether's theorem. Her work was prompted by issues arising from Einstein's theory of general relativity, which suggested that energy could be created or destroyed, challenging the classical conservation laws of physics. Here are the key points:

1. **Background**: In 1915, Einstein's general relativity introduced a dynamic view of space and time, where they could curve due to mass and energy, leading to potential violations of energy conservation.

2. **Noether's Involvement**: David Hilbert and Felix Klein, grappling with these issues, involved Noether. Despite being denied a formal faculty position at the University of Göttingen due to her gender, she tackled the problem.

3. **Noether's Theorems**: 
   - **First Theorem**: Related conservation laws to local symmetries in space-time, which would later influence quantum field theory.
   - **Second Theorem (Noether's Theorem)**: Linked every conservation law to a fundamental symmetry. For example, conservation of energy relates to time-translation symmetry, where the laws of physics remain unchanged over time.

4. **Implications**: Noether showed that conservation laws stem from deeper symmetries rather than being fundamental axioms. This meant that if a symmetry is broken, the corresponding conservation law could also be violated. This insight was revolutionary and helped explain phenomena like the expansion of the universe, where light's energy decreases over time due to cosmic expansion.

5. **Later Life and Legacy**: Noether faced professional setbacks due to Nazi policies and moved to Bryn Mawr College in the U.S., where she continued her work until her untimely death at age 53. Her contributions fundamentally reshaped theoretical physics, showing that the physical laws we observe arise from underlying symmetries.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a cosmological implication of Noether's Theorem, which relates symmetry in physics to conservation laws. In an expanding universe:

1. **Time Asymmetry**: The universe exhibits time asymmetry, meaning it does not look the same going backward or forward in time.

2. **Energy Conservation**: According to Noether's Theorem, this time asymmetry suggests that energy might not be conserved. 

3. **Cosmological Redshift**: As an example, photons (particles of light) traveling through the expanding universe experience cosmological redshift. This means their wavelength increases and their energy decreases over time. The article notes that this lost energy seems to disappear without transferring to another form, which contradicts the usual expectation of energy conservation.

The author expresses surprise that this phenomenon isn't more widely discussed, highlighting a potentially significant issue in understanding the universe's energy dynamics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article titled "Autism as a Disorder of Dimensionality" from opentheory.net discusses an alternative perspective on autism, suggesting that it might be understood through the lens of dimensionality. Here's a summary:

- **Concept of Dimensionality**: The article proposes that autism could be seen as a disorder where individuals perceive and process the world in a different dimensional framework than neurotypical individuals. This means autistic individuals might experience sensory inputs in a way that is less filtered or more complex, leading to an overwhelming amount of detail or a different interpretation of reality.

- **Overwhelming Sensory Input**: Autistic people might have a higher-dimensional sensory experience, where they perceive more aspects or layers of their environment simultaneously, which can be both enriching and overwhelming. This could explain the common sensory sensitivities observed in autism, like aversion to certain sounds or textures.

- **Cognitive and Social Implications**: The theory suggests that this different perception might contribute to the social and communication challenges faced by individuals with autism. They might interpret social cues in a more literal or detailed way, missing the usual social nuances or finding them irrelevant or confusing.

- **Interest and Focus**: The article touches on how individuals with autism often have deep, focused interests, which could be a result of their unique way of processing information, where they dive deeply into one dimension or aspect of their interest.

- **Therapeutic and Educational Approaches**: If autism is viewed through this lens, educational and therapeutic strategies might focus on helping individuals manage this high-dimensional sensory input, possibly through techniques that simplify or segment information, or by teaching them to navigate their sensory experiences in a less overwhelming manner.

- **Personal Reflection**: The reader mentions enjoying the article but acknowledges their lack of expertise, suggesting that while the theory is intriguing, it should be taken as one perspective among many in understanding autism.

This article offers a novel way to conceptualize autism, not as a deficit or disorder in the traditional sense but as a different mode of experiencing and interacting with the world. However, the reader emphasizes the need for further research and validation of these ideas.

## 9. [Go Data Structures: Interfaces (2009)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42946270)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article discusses the implementation and advantages of Go's interfaces, highlighting their unique blend of static type checking at compile time and dynamic method dispatch at runtime. Here are the key points:

1. **Interfaces in Go**: Interfaces allow for duck typing similar to dynamic languages like Python, but with compile-time error checking for method signatures, preventing runtime errors related to method calls.

2. **Interface Definition and Usage**: An interface like `ReadCloser` can be defined to include methods like `Read` and `Close`. Functions can then accept these interfaces, ensuring that any type implementing these methods can be used, with errors caught at compile time if there's a mismatch in method signatures.

3. **Dynamic Method Inquiry**: Go allows for runtime checks to see if an interface value supports additional methods, as demonstrated with the `Stringer` interface and the `ToString` function. This function checks if the interface value can be converted to a `Stringer` to call the `String` method, or handles different types explicitly.

4. **Implementation Details**: Unlike languages that statically prepare method tables or perform dynamic lookups at each call, Go computes method tables at runtime. This approach combines efficiency with flexibility, allowing interfaces to adapt dynamically to the types they hold.

5. **Example with `Binary` Type**: An example using a `Binary` type shows how a value can be passed to functions expecting different interfaces without explicitly stating it implements those interfaces, thanks to Go's interface mechanism.

6. **Comparison with Other Languages**: The article notes that Go's method of handling interfaces is somewhat unique, lying between static method tables and dynamic method lookup, offering a novel approach to interface implementation.

The article concludes by mentioning that while the "gc" compilers (6g, 8g, 5g) and gccgo have similar implementations of interface values, the specifics discussed pertain to the "gc" compilers, with visual aids provided for clarity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article points out that comparisons between Python and other languages regarding type systems are outdated. It highlights that Python has incorporated type hints since version 3.5, released in September 2015, through the `typing` module. Additionally, static type checking can be performed before runtime using tools like `mypy`, which has been available since at least version 0.1 in September 2009. This means Python now supports features that allow for more robust type checking, aligning its capabilities with languages traditionally known for strong static typing.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a specific behavior in the Go programming language regarding type casting. It explains why you can cast a slice of strings (`[]string`) to an empty interface (`interface{}`), but you cannot directly cast a `[]string` to a slice of empty interfaces (`[]interface{}`). The author refers to an external blog post for a detailed explanation of this phenomenon.
