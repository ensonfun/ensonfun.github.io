**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The author of the article discusses their experience with OS/2 6.123 on their PS/2 model 80. They found that the OS was unstable when running certain MS-DOS based games and would often crash with error messages. They attempted to run an old game called BattleTech but had no success. They suspected that their system was lacking a math coprocessor, which could be the reason for the instability. They obtained a math coprocessor and installed it, and found that the system became much more stable and the game ran without any issues. The author also notes that they observed an odd string during crashes and speculates on its meaning.

 The article discusses the author's father's desire to have a computer for computer-aided design (CAD) work. They needed a 387 processor in addition to the 386. The 387 was only produced by Intel, so the cheaper and faster 40MHz AMD processor did not have a corresponding floating point unit (FPU). To work around this, the author's father had a PC assembled with a 40MHz AMD 386 and a 20MHz Intel 387. The system functioned properly as long as the "Turbo" button was pressed to slow down the 386 to 20MHz when using the CAD software. The rest of the software worked fine at 40MHz.

**Total comment counts : 51**

### Summary

 The article discusses the importance of being precise when making requests within product and engineering teams to avoid unnecessary complications. It emphasizes that leaders should clearly communicate the amount of time they are asking for in order to prevent future headaches. The article also suggests following a social media account or subscribing via email for new content.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights three important lessons learned by the author throughout their engineering career. 

Firstly, it emphasizes the need for everyone to operate in good faith. This means avoiding making requests without proper consideration, like leaders who ask for something without much thought, or being overly rigid in following instructions, like employees who require precise syntax before taking action.

Secondly, the article emphasizes that as a manager or leader, there are no isolated or trivial requests. Every ask carries an implicit priority over other tasks, and it is essential to consider the overall system and environment. Failure to do so puts unnecessary pressure on the team to make difficult choices.

Lastly, when someone receives a request, they should help the requestor understand the requirements and eliminate any assumptions. Good communication and agreement on the expectations of the task are vital to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings.

Overall, the article stresses the importance of cooperation, open communication, and mutual support in requestor-requestee situations to improve efficiency and make work life more manageable.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenge engineers face when estimating the time required for certain tasks. When engineers are honest with non-engineers about the actual time needed, the non-engineers are often shocked and decline the request. On the other hand, if non-engineers limit the time investment to a short period, it is perceived as unrealistic by the engineers. This leads to a disconnect and affects productivity. Good engineering management involves keeping engineers away from individuals who may unknowingly distract them from their work.

## 10. [Role play with large language models](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38228320)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenge of describing the behavior of dialogue agents, which are becoming more human-like in their performance, without anthropomorphizing them. The concept of role play is proposed as a way to describe dialogue-agent behavior without ascribing human characteristics to them. The article also explores the fundamental differences between human language skills acquired through embodied interaction and the training of language models. The use of folk psychological language to describe dialogue agents can promote anthropomorphism, so alternative metaphors are suggested. Two metaphors are advocated: viewing dialogue agents as role-playing a single character or as a superposition of simulacra within a multiverse of possible characters. The article emphasizes the need to shift between multiple metaphors to effectively think about and talk about dialogue agents. The function and implementation of language models are also discussed, highlighting their ability to answer questions based on sequences of tokens drawn from a corpus of public text.
