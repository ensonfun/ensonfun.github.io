## 1. [Who lusts for certainty lusts for lies](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37657368)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 In this article, the author criticizes the reliability of Google Ngram Viewer, a tool that displays the frequency of words in books over time. The author argues that the Ngram Viewer's data is flawed and misleading due to errors in Google Books' corpus. The author explains that the database contains a large proportion of academic literature, which skews the results as certain words used frequently in academic writing artificially inflate their scores, while diminishing the scores of other words. The author also mentions other flaws in the Ngram Viewer, such as its inability to recognize variant spellings and misdated files. The article concludes by suggesting that Ngrams should be viewed as decorative or whimsical rather than trusted sources of information. The author encourages readers to rely on more reliable sources, such as Etymonline, which is based on print sources and curated by humans.

The author believes that the use of ngrams is a reflection of our society's preference for pictures over words and warns about the negative impact of algorithms that prioritize profit over accuracy. The article also mentions the rise of generative AI, which is said to rely on ngram prediction. Overall, the article expresses concern about the limitations and consequences of relying on ngrams in our increasingly technology-dominated world.

The FTC and states are seeking a permanent injunction to prohibit Amazon from engaging in unlawful conduct and to restore competition.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the impact of Amazon's monopoly power on small businesses, particularly those selling on the platform as FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) sellers. Many mom and pop businesses, ranging from $250k to $5 million in revenue, have been built on Amazon over the past decade. However, these sellers are feeling squeezed with limited online alternatives, especially after the iOS change. Previously, sellers had the option to connect with platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok through Shopify, but with that option no longer viable, many have had to fully commit to FBA to survive. The article points out that Amazon's monopoly power has led to increased inflation and higher prices for FBA, negatively impacting the revenues of these small businesses. Additionally, Amazon's approach to counterfeits is criticized, as well as their penalization of sellers for attempting to drive sales elsewhere with lower prices on other sites. The article references a Bloomberg write-up on this topic for more information.

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The article contains contact information for the Mathematical Association of America.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two different views on mathematics: one view sees mathematics as a rigid set of rules and algorithms, while the other view sees mathematics as flexible and based on questioning why it works effectively. The author argues that this dichotomy is not inherent in the historical pursuit of mathematics, as the focus on rigor and accuracy developed gradually in the 19th century due to issues with calculus.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 4. [macOS Containers v0.0.1](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37655477)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article announces the release of macOS native containers, which allow users to run macOS inside macOS, build images using Docker, and distribute them using registries. The installation is available via Homebrew. It also notes that Mac and macOS are trademarks of Apple Inc. and that the website is an independent community initiative not authorized or sponsored by Apple Inc.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is about a GitHub repository titled "macOScontainers/homebrew-formula," which seems to relate to macOS native containers. The author expresses interest in this topic, but also remarks on a concerning instruction to disable System Identity Protection.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the functionality of containers and their namespace or isolation of operating system interfaces. It mentions that containers allow various OS functions to operate independently without virtualizing the kernel. The article questions if XNU, the kernel used in macOS, has similar namespacing across its interfaces. It also mentions that the existing container ecosystem assumes a Linux syscall interface, which macOS does not provide. The article then explains how Docker Desktop and podman.io implement "containers on macOS" by running a Linux virtual machine that provides the container environment. Finally, it questions how this project could run a macOS container, considering the differences in syscall interfaces between Linux and macOS.

## 5. [Quadlets might make me finally stop using docker-compose](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37654891)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 The author expresses their love for containers and docker-compose but mentions their interest in exploring quadlets introduced by Podman. Quadlets are a simpler way of managing containers using systemd. In the past, generating systemd unit files through podman was complicated and difficult to edit. Quadlets provide an easier solution with a simple ini-style file. The article includes an example of a quadlet for running WordPress and explains how to set up container dependencies using the Quadlets approach. The author suggests removing docker-compose and leveraging CoreOS's built-in features. The article provides instructions on how to use quadlets with CoreOS, including setting up necessary files and launching an instance. It also explains how quadlets enable automatic container updates and demonstrates how to make configuration changes and restart containers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article explains that there is confusion between the requirements for podman quadlets and coreOS concepts. It clarifies that quadlets only require a `.container` file to be placed correctly in order to create a supervised container using `systemd`. Additionally, it mentions that this approach also supports per-user rootless containers as described in a linked resource provided.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article started using quadlets for system designs and believes there is no reason to stop using docker-compose if developers are comfortable with it. Quadlets are essentially docker-compose in systemd, and the author plans to continue using it but does not consider it to be magical.

## 6. [The casino in your pocket](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37642538)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article discusses a casino trick used by mobile games, focusing on Wordscapes. The game offers rewards and decorations that can be obtained for free or purchased with in-game currency. It introduces a new feature called "Mt. Fortune," where players ascend a mountain with 25 steps, choosing cards along the way that may contain rewards or a rock, which halts progress. If a rock appears, the player must pay coins to continue. The author noticed patterns in the appearance of rocks and tested the game for 28 consecutive days to analyze the odds. They found that the percentage of cards with rocks ranged from 25% to 45% and that rocks tended to appear before or after a basecamp. The article concludes that the game is rigged in the house's favor and that the choice of cards has no impact on the outcome.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the behind-the-scenes workings of free-to-play (f2p) games, revealing that the reward stream in these games is carefully planned out by developers. The author explains that rewards are determined by loot tables, which often contain more undesirable prizes to manipulate player progression. However, there is a "pity" counter that increases every time a player receives an undesired prize, ensuring that they eventually receive a good item. The article suggests that players should only engage with these games if they understand the monetization tactics and have friends to play with, as there are other hobbies with better uses for one's money.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author joined a paid accelerator program to create a mobile game with a company's guidance. However, they were disappointed when they learned that success in the game industry is heavily reliant on manipulation. The game was dumbed down, levels were tweaked to control playtime, and mechanisms were introduced to limit progression without payment. Unfair difficulty spikes and fake promotions were also implemented. The author became disillusioned with the process and lost interest in their game, realizing that creating an exploitative game takes away the enjoyment of game development.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses a preference for smaller games or games created by smaller development teams over AAA titles. They believe that AAA games are predictable and mindless, comparing them to going to the movies. The author's frustration lies in the fact that smaller games often do not receive much attention, even though they can offer unique and enjoyable experiences. They mention that successful games are not solely reliant on their art, but also on gameplay. They provide examples of games like Fez and Doom to support their point. The author encourages aspiring game developers to focus on creating fun games rather than being overly concerned about the visual appearance of their projects. They conclude by praising the art in Commander Keen, with the only criticism being the lack of professional dithering.

 Portugal offers excellent consumer Internet access, with 700 Mbit 5G and 300 Mbit wifi available in most cafes, apartments, and hotels. This is beneficial for travelers who rely on a strong Internet connection. However, this positive aspect is offset by the poor customer service provided by TAP Portugal, which may require the use of the reliable Internet to file complaints.

### Top 2 Comment Summary
