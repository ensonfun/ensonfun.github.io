### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a test that may not only assess color perception but also the quality and calibration of a monitor. It mentions that the test may appear different on displays with different color gamuts. Additionally, the article notes that displaying the colors in full-screen may affect the results due to the optical illusion caused by the auto white balance mechanism in our eyes. The author suggests that either the color display area should be smaller or users should be asked to position a cut-off point for all hues at once.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the method used to determine color perception through clicking buttons is flawed. It states that people are unlikely to click the same button repeatedly, admitting that maybe the color is different than initially thought. The article also suggests possible improvements such as changing the wording and randomizing the order of the buttons. Additionally, it mentions that factors such as color calibration and eye fatigue should be taken into consideration.

## 2. [Greppability is an underrated code metric](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41430772)

**Total comment counts : 95**

### Summary

 The article discusses the importance of keeping code bases easily searchable through the use of grep, a command-line tool for searching text. The author highlights the disadvantages of dynamically constructing identifiers, such as table names, column names, object fields, and function names, as it makes it difficult to find them when searching the code base. The author also suggests flattening folder/object structures when dealing with namespaces, as it improves searchability. The overall message is to prioritize code maintainability by implementing practices that make the code base more grep-friendly.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author argues that tools with a syntactic understanding of code, such as "go to definition" and "find usages," are more effective than simply searching for symbols like function and class names. They mention that they have mostly only searched for user facing strings in the past, as they are longer and easier to search. Additionally, the author suggests that the post they are referring to indicates a need for the author to learn about better tools for their programming language, as a good IDE alone can save a significant amount of time.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that it would be useful for a grep tool to have a "super case insensitive" mode. This mode would expand searches to include variations of capitalization, such as camel case, snake case, pascal case, kebab case, etc. The author believes that this would be a great default feature for the tool.

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 This article discusses the history and evolution of servers in the context of enterprise computing. The author mentions the consolidation of the server market around Intel specifications and the increasing similarity between major options. The article explains that servers originated from time-sharing computing and were often different from client machines in terms of architecture and operating systems. However, with the rise of the PC architecture and horizontal scaling, the distinction between server and client machines has blurred. The article also introduces the concept of out-of-band management, which allows for remote access to servers even when they are powered off. This capability is provided by dedicated hardware and software, separate from the operating system. The author concludes by highlighting the usefulness of out-of-band management, particularly the remote console and virtual media features.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses various aspects of Intel's products and a recommendation for server purchases. It states that Intel is behind AMD in terms of CPU and GPU technology, except for low-power applications. Intel NICs (network interface cards) are generally good, although there have been issues with certain models. Supermicro is suggested as a good option for server purchases due to being cheaper and flexible, but with potentially less reliable support. The article also mentions the replacement of the IPMI specification with Redfish, which is considered more complete and secure. Finally, it acknowledges recent research exposing questionable practices by Supermicro but still recommends their hardware.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits and limitations of Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) in enterprise servers and its rarity in other contexts. The author highlights the challenge of finding compact or low-power computers with IPMI capabilities. They suggest using an Atom-based Supermicro MicroATX board with a Noctua fan in a short-depth 1U chassis as an alternative. The author prefers this option due to its quietness, small size, server features like IPMI and ECC RAM, and reliability compared to other models. They also mention not connecting the IPMI port to the main LAN but finding it useful in isolation.

## 4. [Diffusion Is Spectral Autoregression](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41431293)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article explores the connection between diffusion models and autoregressive models in generative modeling. It explains that both models break down the task of generating complex data into smaller subtasks. Autoregressive models predict one sequence element at a time, while diffusion models gradually destroy the structure of the data and learn to invert this process step by step. The article frames diffusion models as an approximate special case of autoregressive models and highlights that autoregressive models are commonly used for language, while diffusion models are used for images and videos. It also discusses the observation that diffusion models tend to generate images in a coarse-to-fine manner, with large-scale structure decided in earlier denoising steps and finer details added in later steps.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the comparison between audio spectra and image spectra. It highlights that image spectra have a strong power law effect, while audio spectra have more power in middle bands. One reason for this is that the visual spectrum is narrower compared to audio. Another factor not mentioned in the article is that images can be zoomed in or out arbitrarily, resulting in changes in pixel width, whereas in audio, the width of a pixel (the time between two audio samples) is fixed. The article suggests that rescaling all images to a standard size, similar to resampling audio to a standard sample rate, could be an interesting approach.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that speech consists of both high and low frequency components, which are produced and perceived differently. The lower frequencies, below 4KHz, are created by the vocal chords opening and closing at the fundamental frequency, along with its harmonics. These frequencies are then modulated by the changes in the resonances of the vocal tract during pronunciation. The higher frequencies in speech come from the turbulence of air forced out through closed teeth, creating "white noise." Our perception of these higher frequencies is based on the onset and offset of energy in the 4-8KHz range. Frequencies above 8KHz are not very relevant for perception and may be filtered out in certain situations, such as analog telephone speech.

## 9. [Feds killed 2014 plan to curb Medicare Advantage overbilling](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41430310)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Federal officials drafted a plan in 2014 to discourage Medicare Advantage health insurers from overcharging the government by billions of dollars but abandoned it due to industry pressure, according to newly released court filings. The plan would have required health plans to identify overpayments by Medicare and refund them. The decision by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and events related to it are now part of a multibillion-dollar civil fraud case against UnitedHealth Group, which is accused of cheating Medicare out of over $2 billion. UnitedHealth Group denies wrongdoing and argues that it should not be penalized for not following a rule that CMS considered but declined to adopt. The court filings shed light on CMS's struggle to prevent private health plans from taking advantage of taxpayers. Medicare Advantage plans have grown rapidly in recent years, and the industry has faced numerous investigations and lawsuits alleging exaggeration of patient illness to secure higher Medicare payments. The 2014 plan would have prohibited chart reviews aimed at finding additional diagnoses for payment purposes and restricted reviews to only supported diagnoses. CMS officials withdrew the plan due to stakeholder concern and pushback, and the decision reflects a pattern of timid oversight by CMS, according to experts. The fraud case against UnitedHealth Group, the largest Medicare Advantage plan provider, was filed in 2011 and alleges that the company received over $7.2 billion from 2009 to 2016 based on chart reviews but would have obtained $2.1 billion less if unsupported billing codes were deleted.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses support for a potential Department of Justice (DoJ) antitrust remedy against United Healthcare, suggesting that a breakup or dissolution may be appropriate. The article highlights a 2014 decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and subsequent events that have led to a multibillion-dollar civil fraud case against UnitedHealth Group filed by the DoJ. The author commends the DoJ for pursuing the case and expresses hope for a successful outcome.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an incident that occurred in 2014, where someone was killed instead of being intended to be killed. This incident has recently become known due to a legal case involving the Department of Justice and United Healthcare.
