 In the future, it is predicted that people will use their phones to verbally request products like books, computers, and cars, and an AI will generate a selection of products for them to choose from. These products will be drop-shipped from China, potentially being low-quality counterfeits. Furthermore, review websites will also be AI-generated, making it difficult for consumers to determine the authenticity of products. This future is compared to the movie "The Matrix." Despite the imperfections, advancements in silicon technology over the next century are expected to drastically change the capabilities of computers.

## 3. [Malignant melanoma deploys elegant molecular mechanism to evade immune responses](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37042790)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 Scientists at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center have discovered that malignant melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer, uses a molecular mechanism to evade both natural immune responses and immune-boosting therapies. The study identified a cell surface protein called CD58, which stimulates T cells and is important for anti-tumor responses. The researchers found that tumor cells that suppressed CD58 expression were better able to escape immune surveillance. They also identified a protein called CMTM6, which stabilizes CD58 and another protein called PD-L1, which inhibits T cell activity. The findings provide insights into how melanomas avoid immune responses and suggest potential strategies for targeting this and other types of cancer.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses immune evasion in cancer, which is important because immunotherapy has emerged as a groundbreaking therapy. However, while immunotherapy is effective in blood cancers, it struggles in solid tumors. One reason for this is that cancer cells can change their microenvironment to exclude immune cells. The article explores how cancer cells turn off a protein called CD58, which immune cells normally bind to. Binding to CD58 causes changes in the immune cell, but cancer cells overgenerate another protein called PD-L1, which leads to self-destruct signals in immune cells. Furthermore, when cancer cells turn off CD58, they become more slippery and difficult for immune cells to bind to. The article also mentions a third protein that binds to both CD58 and PD-L1, increasing their activity on the cell's surface. This regulatory protein preferentially binds to CD58, promoting immune cell adhesion and recognition of tumor cells. However, when CD58 is lost, the regulatory protein binds to PD-L1, promoting immune cell evasion. The reasons behind this regulatory mechanism are still not fully understood but highlight the complexity of cell biology.

 This article questions how cancers are able to develop sophisticated methods of evading the immune system, despite lacking any adaptive pressure. The author compares this phenomenon to randomly typing on a keyboard and producing a functional program.

## 4. [Downfall Attacks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37052586)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 The Downfall attack is a vulnerability in billions of modern processors, including Intel processors, used in personal and cloud computers. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2022-40982, allows a user to access and steal data from other users who share the same computer. Malicious apps can exploit this vulnerability to steal sensitive information such as passwords and encryption keys. Similarly, in cloud computing environments, a malicious customer can exploit the vulnerability to steal data and credentials from other customers. The vulnerability is caused by memory optimization features in Intel processors that unintentionally expose internal hardware registers to software. The vulnerability has been present since 2014 and affects computing devices based on Intel Core processors from the 6th Skylake to the 11th Tiger Lake generation. Intel is releasing a microcode update to mitigate the vulnerability, but it may lead to up to 50% overhead in some workloads. Other processor vendors and designers should also be concerned about similar vulnerabilities and take extra measures to prevent data leakage. The technical details of the Downfall attack will be presented at security conferences, and the code for the attack can be found on GitHub.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article raises a question about the discovery and patching of security attacks on computer chips. Despite chipmakers having the advantage of expertise and access to resources, it has been outside researchers who have been finding and fixing these vulnerabilities. The author suggests that chipmakers should have been proactive in searching for such attacks after the initial Spectre attacks. They speculate that the chipmakers may be aware of these attacks but choose not to disclose them to avoid negative consequences.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a paper from Intel about gathering data through sampling and possible security concerns related to it. The author questions the relevance of the paper, stating that most clouds have updated their schedulers to prevent cross-domain leaks between hyperthreads. They also mention that the claim of affecting all internet users seems exaggerated, as no browser-based exploit has been demonstrated and past vulnerabilities like Spectre have not been found in the wild. The author finds it more interesting that speculation bugs like this one can be addressed through software and microcode changes without the need for replacing physical chips, except for certain cases like early versions of AMD SEV.

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 The NightOwl application, which automatically switches between light and dark modes on operating systems, has been bought out by TPE.FYI LLC. However, it has been discovered that the application forcibly joins users' devices into a botnet for market research purposes without their knowledge or consent. The application, even when quit, operates in the background through a launch agent named org.nightowl.autoupdater.com that runs as root and cannot be disabled. It also uses Google Analytics to collect statistics but does not disable the launch agent when users opt out of tracking. The application establishes an SSH connection and opens up a proxy to tunnel HTTP traffic and potentially accesses user data. It also utilizes the Pawns SDK to pay users for sharing their internet connections. The company behind the application, TPE, is developing a pricing model based on analytics for ticket pricing. The application has been seen making connections to a ticket-selling website in Austin, Texas, but further information is limited.

## 10. [Web Scraping via JavaScript Runtime Heap Snapshots (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37047746)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The web has become increasingly hostile to web scrapers due to the use of dynamic apps and anti-web scraping measures implemented by large companies. However, the author of the article found a way to extract data from closed platforms by using a unique string from the web page and taking a heap snapshot of the browser's Javascript runtime. The author developed a Node.js module called puppeteer-heap-snapshot, which can capture and parse heap snapshots to extract data. This method reduces the complexity and maintenance cost of traditional web scraping techniques. However, it still has limitations as the public data may change and it is not a foolproof method. The author suggests that Web Assembly may be the future of web scraping.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the web has become less friendly towards web scrapers due to the shift from static web pages to dynamic apps built with frameworks like React and CSS-in-JS. However, the author notes that at times, scraping can actually be easier because additional content is often served as structured data via XHR-JSON. Browser-based scraping is useful when data is mangled or obfuscated, protected by captchas, or when information about hidden text or its position on the page is needed.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author shares a personal experience of being kicked out of a Facebook group for reasons they believe were fabricated. They express frustration at not being able to provide evidence to support their claims due to being banned from the group.
