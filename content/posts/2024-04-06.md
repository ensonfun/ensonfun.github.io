## 4. [Why CockroachDB doesn't use EvalPlanQual](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39948686)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the behavior of the PostgreSQL database under READ COMMITTED isolation and how CockroachDB differs in its implementation. Under READ COMMITTED isolation, PostgreSQL can sometimes miss rows when performing certain statements, which can lead to anomalies in the data. CockroachDB, on the other hand, uses a different technique that doesn't miss rows, thereby avoiding the need for application-level retries. The article provides an example to illustrate this difference in behavior.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses the addition of read committed isolation to CockroachDB and highlights the interesting design decisions made during the process. The decisions include whether to use multiple snapshots or a single snapshot per statement, how to handle read uncertainty intervals, incorporating SELECT FOR UPDATE locking into Raft, handling SELECT FOR UPDATE subqueries, and preventing lost update anomalies between two UPDATEs. The article provides more details in a public RFC, but this blog post specifically focuses on the last point. The author also invites readers to ask them anything (AMA).

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how new SQL databases not only offer better scalability but are also simpler in terms of consistency models compared to standard SQL databases. The author suggests that this simplicity in consistency models may be due to older databases like PostgreSQL prioritizing single-node performance, while new SQL databases prioritize easy consistency. The author also speculates that newer systems may benefit from advancements over time.

## 5. [NIST researchers use cellphone compass to measure glucose](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39948840)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a technique that uses the magnetometer in an ordinary cellphone to measure the concentration of glucose with high accuracy. The technique involves using magnetic materials that respond to biological or environmental cues and change shape, causing the magnetic particles to move closer to or farther from the cellphone's magnetometer. This method could potentially be used to measure a range of biomedical properties for disease monitoring or diagnosis. It may also have applications in detecting environmental toxins. The researchers achieved high sensitivity, measuring glucose concentrations as small as a few millionths of a mole. The technique is cost-effective and does not require any special processing of samples or additional electronics. In the future, it could be used to detect DNA strands, proteins, and histamines at extremely low concentrations. The researchers suggest that mass producing the hydrogel test strips used in the technique and ensuring their long shelf life would be necessary for commercial success.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a recent development in glucose monitoring technology. The researchers have created a material that can contract or expand depending on glucose levels and can be detected by a magnetometer. However, the method still requires a sample to be deposited in the material, making it not non-invasive. Under-skin devices currently available are still more convenient. The article suggests that this development could result in new devices that offer laboratory precision at a very low cost, with the phone component being irrelevant.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges faced by spectroscopy-based noninvasive sensing techniques. These techniques have been attempted for about 15 years with limited success. The main issue is how well these sensors perform under various conditions such as exercise, the use of vasoconstrictors, taking certain medications, low perfusion, and when the sensor is compressed during sleep. These challenges need to be addressed in order to avoid false readings and provide accurate measurements.

### Summary

 This article provides an overview of the history and evolution of source control management (SCM) systems. It discusses the influential systems over time, starting with SCCS and RCS, which were local systems that versioned single files. It mentions the rise of centralized version control systems like CVS, SourceSafe, and ClearCase, which allowed concurrent access to the same files. The article also touches on the evolution of centralized systems, including SVN and Perforce. It mentions decentralized version control systems, such as Bitkeeper, GNU Arch, Monotone, and Darcs. The article mentions the version control system wars between 2005 to 2015, where Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar were developed. It briefly discusses the current landscape of version control systems and introduces Fossil and Pijul. The article concludes by inviting feedback on the blog series. It then goes on to explain the emergence of the first version control system, SCCS, in 1972, and its limitations compared to modern systems. SCCS managed multiple versions of files but lacked concepts like a repository or tracked files.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 The article discusses the utilization of tests to gather data. The focus is on a specific test that examines an arbitrary SQL statement and identifies the locks that are taken through runtime inspection.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is about a misunderstanding of a headline that initially led the reader to believe there was a bug in Postgres, causing explorer.exe to freeze.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that while theoretical information about locking in PostgreSQL is interesting, it may not be helpful in practical situations where you need to understand why something is locking. Instead, the article recommends checking out two PostgreSQL wiki pages that provide information on lock monitoring and lock dependency. The "Recursive view of blocking" on the second page is specifically mentioned as being extremely helpful. The article also suggests modifying a query to show all the locks each process ID (pid) has acquired, instead of just a summary.

## 9. [NASA spacecraft films crazy vortex while flying through sun's atmosphere](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39952111)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 NASA's Parker Solar Probe has captured footage of massive "vortex-like structures" in the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona. This unprecedented view was taken by the probe's WISPR camera. Researchers believe that these structures were caused by a coronal mass ejection (CME) interacting with the solar wind. This discovery provides new opportunities to understand and predict CMEs, which can disrupt communications and electrical grids on Earth. These vortices, known as "Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities," pose a threat to satellites and power grids. The Parker Solar Probe will continue its mission to study the sun's corona by diving closer to it, protected by a carbon heat shield.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the confirmation of certain plasma instabilities that were predicted in the late 80s. The author mentions that during their PhD, they simulated Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities on supercomputers in relation to solar dynamics. They express satisfaction in seeing that these instabilities do indeed exist and behave as predicted. Additionally, they mention that many other plasma instabilities that were predicted at that time have also been confirmed by space probes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary
