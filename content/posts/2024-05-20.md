### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article argues against the myth that medieval people did not drink water. While it is true that they drank beer in larger quantities, it does not mean they completely avoided water. Medieval people understood that beer was safer to drink, as it was boiled during the brewing process and contained aromatics like hops that acted as mild antiseptics. Beer was preferred for several reasons: it was tasty, convenient, prevented digestive issues, affordable, provided energy during labor-intensive days, and did not carry a social stigma as long as one did not get drunk. Brewers also kept the alcohol content low so that people could drink it throughout the day. Despite the US prohibition, people were surprised to learn that workers consumed large quantities of low-alcohol beverages like cider, often provided by workplaces. Therefore, while water was consumed, low-alcohol drinks were the preferred choice, especially in urban areas.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that the idea of water carrying diseases is a relatively recent concept. However, it argues that in the past, people understood the difference between clean and dirty water and were aware of the dangers associated with contaminated water sources, without necessarily knowing about viruses and bacteria. Ancient people had experiential knowledge of such issues without understanding the scientific mechanisms behind them.

## 7. [The problem with new URL(), and how URL.parse() fixes that](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40410414)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses the URL API in browsers and its limitations. When using the "new URL()" constructor to parse URLs, if an invalid URL is provided, it throws an error that needs to be handled. However, a recent addition to the URL API called URL.canParse() can be used to check if a URL is parseable before actually parsing it. This new feature simplifies the code and makes it more readable. The author had complained on Twitter about the API choice, which led to the addition of URL.parse() function to the URL API. This function does not throw an error for invalid URLs. The implementation of this feature is in progress for different browser engines. The author looks forward to using URL.parse() to eliminate the need for try...catch calls.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of constructors and their return values in JavaScript. It argues against having a constructor of type T that does not return an object of type T. Instead, it suggests using a tryParse() wrapper for the "return null on error" behavior if needed. The article also comments on the use of a constructor for URLs with just a string argument, stating that a static factory function would be a better alternative. It proposes that a proper public URL constructor should take individual components (scheme, authority, path, query, fragment) and validate them, while a private URL constructor without validation could be used internally by the parse() function and the public constructor.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses error handling in modern programming languages like Swift. These languages use the try/catch pattern as the primary way to handle errors. However, they provide a more concise syntax for cases where developers don't care about the specific error or are not performing multiple error-prone operations in close succession. This syntax allows developers to write `try?` before a statement to produce an optional result. The article also mentions that this behavior is similar to Swift's handling of the `URL` type.

## 8. [Swift Tooling: Windows Edition](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40404676)

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is surprised to see it on the front page and expresses that their opinions on programming style guides have shifted over the years. They now find mechanistic enforcement and close-to-live-feedback more effective for maintaining code quality. The article was written during a period of work on a green-field power system microcontroller project, where the author opted for C programming language. They had control over the codebase's style and used the opportunity to consider and evolve their C programming style. The author's personal C code style has also shifted towards older, more conventional styles. They acknowledge that opinionated documents like this can serve as discussion prompts.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article emphasizes the importance of building speed into software architecture from the beginning, rather than adding it as an afterthought. It suggests that benchmarks applied after meeting goals of readability and maintainability only measure the limits of that approach, and they cannot capture the results of trying and benchmarking different approaches at the outset. The article also notes that sometimes the fastest approach may not be the most maintainable, but that may not be an issue in certain cases where maintenance is not expected.
