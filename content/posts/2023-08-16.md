## 1. [LK-99 isn’t a superconductor](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37149349)

**Total comment counts : 76**

### Summary

 Researchers have discovered that LK-99, a compound of copper, lead, phosphorus, and oxygen, is not a superconductor as previously claimed. The material showed properties that resembled superconductivity, such as levitation over a magnet and sharp drops in electrical resistivity, but further studies revealed that impurities in the material, particularly copper sulfide, were responsible for these effects. Replication efforts by different teams also failed to produce room-temperature superconductivity. The conclusion is that LK-99 is an insulator, not a superconductor.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that although there is disappointment in the news, there was excitement and a lot of replication around a particular paper. The most interesting part was the discussion about the potential consequences and uses of the findings, particularly in fields like pumps, MRIs, power grids, and chips. This serves as a reminder of the impact that materials science can have on underlying economics.

## 4. [NetMaker: Connect Everything with a WireGuard VPN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37142388)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article is about a virtual networking solution called Netmaker that provides convenient access to external networks. It offers managed access between devices, private domains for devices, visibility into network performance, better uptime for connections, and access and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for users. Netmaker connects devices across different environments by bypassing NATs, firewalls, and subnets. It creates a secure overlay network that allows devices to communicate directly and securely. The solution is available in EE (Enterprise Edition) and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) and is claimed to be better, faster, and more secure.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a comparison of various network technologies, including Yggdrasil, tinc, Tailscale, Zerotier, Netmaker, and Nebula. The author states a preference for Yggdrasil but also mentions that the comparison led them to choose Netmaker, which they have been running without any issues for experimentation. They agree that Netmaker is moving quickly in terms of development and configuration changes but expect this from a project that is still in its early releases. The author finds Netmaker's use of vanilla WireGuard, route coordination, and STUN/TURN protocols reasonable and appreciates that the documentation is written for self-hosters.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a comparison between Tailscale and NetMaker, two networking solutions. Tailscale is noted for its self-hosting feature and extensive WireGuard support, whereas NetMaker lacks self-hosting and has limited WireGuard support. However, Tailscale's ACLs can potentially address the limitations mentioned. The claim that data regularly passes through NetMaker's relay servers is disputed, as it is rare in practice. The only advantage found for NetMaker is its richer free plan and use of the WireGuard kernel module.

## 9. [Peter Pan copyright](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37128929)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 In 1929, J.M. Barrie gifted the rights to Peter Pan to Great Ormond Street Hospital. This has provided the hospital with a significant source of income to support its work. The copyright for Peter Pan expired in the UK and Europe in 1987, but an amendment to the CDPA in 1988 gave the hospital the right to royalties from stage performances, publications, audio books, films, and more. In 1996, the copyright term was extended to 70 years after the author's death throughout the European Union. Although the novel is in the public domain in the US, the play and adaptations are under copyright until December 2023. The hospital receives a percentage of the ticket or book prices for any performances or publications of Peter Pan. Overall, the hospital will continue to benefit from Barrie's gift in perpetuity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the irony of a child who refuses to grow up being given perpetual copyright. The author suggests that instead of distorting copyright law for special interests, it would have been better for the government to estimate the hypothetical royalties and establish an endowment to support the hospital.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a special provision in UK law that grants Great Ormond Street Hospital the right to receive royalties for the work "Peter Pan." The provision is outlined in the 1988 UK legislation, Schedule 6.
