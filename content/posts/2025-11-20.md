## 5. [Data-at-Rest Encryption in DuckDB](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45996585)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 DuckDB v1.4 adds at-rest encryption with AES-GCM-256 and AES-CTR-256 (32-byte keys). AES-GCM provides confidentiality and authentication via a tag; AES-CTR is faster but lacks authentication. Encryption uses an IV (usually 16 bytes) and a nonce (12 bytes) to form per-block IVs; IVs must be unique. The main database header remains plaintext, and enabling encryption sets a flag in the header. Previously, DuckDB supported Parquet Modular Encryption for encrypted Parquet files; the new feature enables in-database encryption (not yet NIST-compliant).

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread discusses database encryption practices, focusing on AES-GCM nonce handling, implementation choices in DuckDB, and how these affect cloud/multi-user deployments and comparisons to SQLite encryption options.
- Concern: A major worry is AES-GCM nonce reuse risk and opaque nonce randomness in the header (16 bytes vs 12), which could undermine security.
- Perspectives: Views vary from praise of DuckDB’s page-level encryption and performance to critiques about nonce opacity and interest in alternative encryption options like SQLite3MultipleCiphers or paid SQLite extensions.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 7. [Run Docker containers natively in Proxmox 9.1 (OCI images)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45997722)

**Total comment counts : 2**

### Summary

 Proxmox VE 9.1 adds OCI template support, letting Docker/OCI images run as application containers by converting Docker images into LXC containers. This is a tech preview, not a full native Docker experience; for orchestration or live migration, use a Proxmox QEMU VM. Current limits include a single rootfs per container, no straightforward image-based updates, and limited shell access (use pct enter). To try it, update to 9.1.1, pull an OCI image into storage, then create a container from the downloaded template (e.g., docker.io/… image).

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Exploring a platform that simplifies networking (no macvlan or custom Docker networks) but currently lacks an easy way to update containers.
- Concern: The main worry is the absence of an easy container update workflow.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from appreciating the networking simplification to concerns about updates, plus curiosity about its similarity to FlyIO's microVM approach.
- Overall sentiment: Cautiously optimistic
