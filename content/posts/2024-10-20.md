## 3. [Accountability sinks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41891694)

**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

 In "The Unaccountability Machine," Dan Davies discusses the concept of "accountability sinks," which are organizational structures that obscure or diffuse responsibility for decisions, making it difficult to hold anyone accountable. He illustrates this with examples from various sectors, such as hospitality and media, where the consequences of decisions made by higher-ups are felt by customers or the public, but often without a direct line to those responsible. Davies argues that these sinks operate by severing feedback between decision-makers and those affected, leading to a lack of accountability.

He also highlights the cascading nature of decision-making, where implicit understandings within organizations lead to acceptance of certain actions without clear responsibility. Davies articulates the fundamental law of accountability: your ability to change a decision correlates with your accountability for it. He references Sidney Dekker’s definition of accountability as a narrative that explains how decisions are made, emphasizing the necessity of understanding the context and individuals involved.

Davies warns that the rise of AI as a decision-maker may further entrench these accountability sinks. He concludes that efforts to hold organizations accountable may face similar challenges when trying to do the same with algorithms, suggesting a need for innovative approaches to address these issues.

## 5. [How to do distributed locking (2016)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41894451)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article by Martin Kleppmann discusses the Redlock algorithm, which is designed to provide fault-tolerant distributed locks using Redis. While the author appreciates Redis for certain use cases involving transient data, he expresses concern about its application in areas demanding strong consistency and durability, such as distributed locking.

Kleppmann distinguishes between using locks for efficiency and correctness. He argues that if locks are solely for efficiency, a single Redis instance suffices, despite potential data loss during failures. However, Redlock's complexity, involving multiple Redis replicas and majority voting, may mislead users into believing it’s reliable for correctness-critical scenarios.

The article emphasizes that distributed locking differs significantly from mutexes in multi-threaded applications due to the independent failure risks of nodes and networks. It highlights potential pitfalls in the use of locks within distributed systems, particularly when clients might concurrently manipulate shared resources, which can lead to data corruption.

In summary, Kleppmann calls for caution with Redlock, suggesting that while it offers an interesting approach, it may not be suitable for situations where lock correctness is critical.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of Temporal for implementing distributed locking at work. The team created a dedicated workflow and utilized signals, finding the implementation straightforward and effective due to Temporal's capabilities for managing distributed aspects of the lock.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests reviewing their previous comment on a blog post and a reply in their own blog. Key points include:

1. The original blog's author overlooked a critical aspect of an algorithm, basing criticisms on less significant issues.
2. Modern computers and APIs can reliably measure time, disputing claims that timing issues prevent accuracy.
3. Critiquing the auto-release mechanism due to potential race conditions differs from evaluating the algorithm according to its intended goals and system model.
4. Redlock has been successfully used in many scenarios, provided that timeouts are appropriately set larger than both task completion time and typical operating system pauses. Failures noted in the original article have not been commonly observed; issues arise mainly from poor timeout design rather than flaws in Redlock itself.

## 7. [Implementing neural networks on the "3 cent" 8-bit microcontroller](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41889467)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 Tim's blog explores the potential of implementing a neural network on the low-end Padauk PMS150C microcontroller, motivated by successful quantization-aware training on the CH32V003. The goal is to compress the neural network while maintaining accurate classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The PMS150C features very limited memory (1024 words of ROM and 64 bytes of RAM), prompting the author to downscale MNIST images from 28x28 to 8x8 pixels, significantly losing detail but still allowing for training a model that can achieve over 90% accuracy.

The author conducted hyperparameter tuning on different network configurations and found a clear relationship between network size and accuracy. Notably, smaller models with 8x8 image input showed surprising efficiency in recognizing digits, achieving an accuracy of around 90.07% with a total size of only 3392 bits (0.414 kilobytes). The design had to accommodate the microcontroller's tight RAM constraints, using narrow layers and custom weight encoding to further streamline the inference process. The outcome reinforces the feasibility of neural network implementations even on extremely limited hardware.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a significant challenge when programming devices in C: the consumption of RAM for return stack and function parameters during function calls. To mitigate this, the author suggests avoiding function parameters by using global variables and minimizing function calls, ideally eliminating them. The author successfully "flattened" the inference code and implemented the inner loop in assembly to optimize memory usage, acknowledging that this is necessary since C compilers may not be efficient on such CPUs.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a method for processing images in a way that limits memory usage by treating the image as an input stream rather than holding it in full at once. The approach involves using a 1D convolution on each line of a 28x28 image, transforming it into a smaller output. As lines are processed, results are used to perform 2D convolutions on the accumulated data, allowing for efficient processing without holding the entire image in memory simultaneously.

## 8. [Origin of 'Daemon' in Computing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41891953)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article discusses the origin of the word "daemon" in computing, particularly attributed to Professor Fernando J. Corbato's team at Project MAC in 1963. The term was inspired by Maxwell's daemon from physics, which refers to a hypothetical entity sorting molecules and performing background tasks, echoing how daemons in computing manage system processes automatically. 

The article also clarifies that "daemon" and "demon" were once interchangeable, with their meanings diverging over time. The historical context explains how "daemon" transitioned from a benign spirit to a term referring to natural supernatural beings, while "demon" became associated with evil. 

Professor Jerome H. Saltzer supports the Maxwell's daemon connection, while the article hints at an ongoing investigation into the misconception that "daemon" stands for an acronym. The authors express their satisfaction in tracing the term's etymology clearly.
