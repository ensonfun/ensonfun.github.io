## 10. [Damas-Hindley-Milner inference two ways](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41853780)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The Damas-Hindley-Milner (HM) type system is an expressive type system for lambda calculus, which later influenced languages like Standard ML. It supports parametric polymorphism (generic functions) and allows type inference without needing any annotations from the programmer. Key figures in its development include Milner and Damas. 

The HM system works by generating constraints based on variables and their interactions, primarily using equality constraints. For instance, analyzing an expression like `a + b` can help infer that both `a` and `b` are integers, leading to the conclusion that any function applied to `a` (such as `f a`) is also a function that takes integers. 

The system uses type constructors and type variables to organize and track types, with each expression having a single monotype. The article discusses implementing type inference algorithms, notably Algorithm W and Algorithm J, each with distinct approaches to managing state during the inference process. 

Algorithm W is noted for its correctness and side-effect-free nature, requiring careful state management. The inference process involves constraining existing type variables or creating new ones as more information is uncovered. Overall, the aim is to deepen understanding of the HM type system, particularly in the context of ScrapScript.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article provides an overview of the Hindley-Milner type system and discusses the author's exploration of a more effective way to specify type inference with principal derivations.
