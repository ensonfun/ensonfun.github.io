## 2. [The Om Programming Language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47154971)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Om is a header‑only C++ library and language that you can embed in C++ or Objective‑C++ projects. It defines a concatenative, prefix‑notation language where every value is an operand and programs evaluate as functions returning new programs. Operators, separators, and operands form an Om program; separators act as identities and are discarded in input, while concatenation represents function composition. Om uses a panmorphic type system where there are no traditional data types; any operand can be processed by any operation. The project includes build and documentation scripts, tests, and is licensed under the Eclipse Public License 1.0, hosted on GitHub.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: There is a push to surface example language syntax above the fold and a complaint that the current material lacks runnable code, amid confusion around Om-related projects.
- Concern: The main worry is that hiding syntax and insufficient code examples could hinder understanding and adoption, with questions about edge cases like unmatched braces.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from demanding early, visible syntax and more explanatory material, to praising Jason (Om’s creator) while noting confusion with related projects, to criticizing the absence of examples.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 3. [Making MCP cheaper via CLI](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47157398)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article argues that MCP overcharges AI agents by preloading every tool’s JSON Schema into the session, while a CLI-style approach lazily loads tool info. With a typical setup (6 MCP servers, 84 tools), MCP preloads all schemas, increasing token usage; a CLI approach stores only names/locations and discovers details on demand. The author estimates CLI uses ~94% fewer tokens overall than MCP (even after discovery). Anthropic Tool Search further reduces token usage (~85%) by indexing tools but still fetches full schemas and is Anthropic-only. The author also built CLIHub, an open-source converter to generate CLIs from MCPs.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on using a text-driven CLI layer (often atop MCP tools) to let LLMs control software by issuing commands, rather than having the LLM generate arbitrary code.  
- Concern: This approach risks context-window bloat, non-composability of tools, and added security/authentication and deployment complexities.  
- Perspectives: Some advocate a Unix-like, CLI-first architecture with a single MCP server and observable command flows for testability and safety, while others critique tool fragmentation and data/token inefficiencies and propose leveraging existing CLIs or better tooling catalogs.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 4. [Bus stop balancing is fast, cheap, and effective](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47153798)

**Total comment counts : 76**

### Summary

 Addressing bus speed is often overlooked; buses carry more riders than rail but are slow. A simple, cheap fix: adjust stop spacing (stop balancing). Increase distance between stops from ~700–800 ft to about 1,300 ft, aligning with Europe. This reduces dwell time, acceleration/deceleration, and missed signals, boosting speed and reliability without new infrastructure. US stops are far closer together (about 313 m on average; Chicago/Philadelphia/SF even denser) than Europe (300–450 m). Closer stops raise operating costs and lower service quality; many stops lack shelters or real-time info. Implementable quickly by removing signs and updating schedules; improves coverage and efficiency.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether reducing or rebalancing bus stops and changing routes can meaningfully boost ridership, or whether broader issues like underfunding and car-oriented street design are the real bottlenecks.
- Concern: Removing stops could decrease accessibility and reliability, especially for vulnerable riders, and political and budget constraints may prevent any meaningful reform.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from proponents of bus-stop rebalancing and express-like services as cost-effective improvements to skeptics who worry about marginal gains, political feasibility, and the importance of maintaining frequent, accessible stops; many highlight funding shortfalls and pedestrian-infrastructure as fundamental constraints, with mixed experiences across cities.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

 error

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on Windows Notepad being revamped with Markdown support and other features, amid security concerns such as CVE-2026-20841.  
- Concern: These changes could bloat a simple tool, undermine plain-text reliability, and introduce new security and compatibility issues.  
- Perspectives: Opinions range from seeing Markdown/AI enhancements as useful modernization to arguing for keeping Notepad minimal and resisting turning it into a WordPad-like editor.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [Large-Scale Online Deanonymization with LLMs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47139716)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 Researchers show LLMs can deanonymize online users by linking anonymous posts to real identities across platforms. They create two deanonymization proxies and perform real-world tests (HN–LinkedIn, Reddit splits, Anthropic Interviewer). Embeddings plus reasoning achieve high precision, scaling to tens of thousands of candidates; as data pools grow, attacks degrade gracefully but remain potent and could scale to entire platforms. They discuss harms (spear-phishing, monetization) and mitigation: stricter data access controls, rate limiting, scrape detection, bulk export restrictions; platforms and LLM labs should adopt safeguards.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread discusses whether online anonymity can survive increasing de-anonymization techniques and how people should balance honesty, safety, and privacy online.
- Concern: The main worry is that de-anonymization can be achieved with little information, leading to surveillance, censorship, reputational harm, and a chilling effect on expression.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from advocating real-name accountability and cautious sharing, to exploring provocative tactics to blunt trolls, to citing de-anonymization research and OSINT as evidence anonymity is fragile, and to proposing countermeasures like stylometry protection and local LLM-based rewriting, while acknowledging that risk is higher for activists or whistleblowers than for average users.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 7. [Show HN: I ported Tree-sitter to Go](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47155597)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Pure Go tree-sitter runtime with no CGo, no C toolchain, WASM-ready. Uses the same parse-table format as tree-sitter, so existing grammars work without recompilation. Outperforms the CGo binding in every workload; incremental edits are 90x faster; no-edit path requires zero allocations and nanoseconds. It reuses subtrees after edits, re-parsing only changed regions. Supports Tree-sitter’s S-expression queries (predicates and streaming). Detect language by filename for editors. Registry ships 205 grammars; 111 languages with Go external scanners; 1 language (norg) needs an external scanner. Build with -tags grammar_blobs_external or grammar_set_core. Current release: v0.4.0.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A discussion evaluating a Go-based alternative to Tree-sitter (got) that aims to remove CGO dependencies and assess its practicality for grammar tooling and syntax highlighting.
- Concern: The main worries include whether a pure-Go approach can actually replace or port Tree-sitter features without sacrificing correctness, performance, or ecosystem compatibility (e.g., benchmarks, external scanners, and grammar regeneration).
- Perspectives: Some participants are excited about Go-native, CGO-free builds and potential use in forges and tooling, while others are skeptical about performance claims, grammar maturity, and real-world usability.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [Following 35% growth, solar has passed hydro on US grid](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47154009)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 US electricity in 2025 rose 2.8% to about 121 TWh, driven by higher overall demand. Solar surged 35% and, for the first time, surpassed hydro; wind grew as well. Coal output rose 13% as demand and LNG exports boosted its economics, with no new nuclear plants built. Solar capacity largely absorbed the rise in demand, though gas and some coal filled the gap. Looking ahead, 2026 projects add about 43 GW solar and 12 GW wind, plus 24 GW of storage; renewables near a quarter of the mix, signaling a continued shift away from coal.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on transitioning to renewable energy (solar, wind, and storage) and the associated data, economics, and infrastructure needed to make the grid reliable.
- Concern: The main worry is that without large-scale storage and transmission upgrades, increasing renewable generation could destabilize the grid, raise costs for consumers, and leave regions vulnerable during extreme events.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from strong optimism about renewables and decentralized generation to emphasis on storage, transmission expansion, and a pragmatic mix (nuclear, hydro, pumped storage), with some critics highlighting political barriers and data interpretation.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed (cautiously optimistic)

## 9. [Dissecting the CPU-memory relationship in garbage collection (OpenJDK 26)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47137140)

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 The article argues that sizing a Java heap trades money for throughput and latency. Modern GC decouples pause duration from compute overhead, creating a blind spot where dashboards show good latency while GC quietly consumes CPU. To enable informed decisions, we must measure infrastructure efficiency beyond pauses. It introduces OpenJDK 26's new GC CPU API to quantify explicit GC cost and identifies three cost dimensions: explicit GC work, implicit costs (barriers), and microarchitectural effects. It also clarifies wall-clock vs CPU time, showing that heap size affects both throughput and CPU overhead, complicating pause-focused thinking.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The author announces a new telemetry framework integrated into OpenJDK 26 to measure GC CPU overhead and quantify the CPU-memory trade-off beyond pause-time metrics.
- Concern: No explicit concerns are raised; the post emphasizes benefits and invites questions.
- Perspectives: The viewpoint is primarily the author’s promotional, informational stance, with readers expected to evaluate usefulness and ask questions about the implementation.
- Overall sentiment: Optimistic
