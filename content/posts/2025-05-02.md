## 6. [Bloom Filters](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43866001)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 Bloom filters, introduced by Burton Bloom in 1970, provide an efficient probabilistic method for determining set membership while minimizing disk read times. They utilize an array of bits and multiple hash functions to quickly check if an item is in a set, allowing for false positives but ensuring that false negatives do not occur. Bloom filters require minimal space—approximately 1.2 GB for 1 billion items with a 1% false positive rate—and offer rapid lookup times, typically around 80 nanoseconds per query. They are particularly advantageous when negative query responses are common.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses "compact approximators," a generalization of Bloom filters that provide a lower bound on values associated with keys instead of merely indicating presence in a set. Unlike Bloom filters, these structures do not degrade as old data ages, allowing continuous use. The author applies this concept to implicit cache invalidation, where the approximators track when items are removed from groups, enabling efficient decisions on cached values without costly searches. The author expresses enthusiasm for exploring new use cases, reminiscent of their initial excitement with Bloom filters.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Bloom filters can efficiently compute the intersection of two sets represented by them using a bitwise AND operation if they share the same key set and configuration. By aligning and padding bitsets to fit SIMD vector sizes, this process becomes fast on modern hardware. The author successfully applied this method to filter 3D objects from a large dataset using intersections of multiple range queries. While the probabilistic nature of Bloom filters requires validating positive results against original queries, the setup typically eliminates most false positives.
