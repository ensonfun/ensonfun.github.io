## 4. [The appendix is not, in fact, useless](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39294346)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 Heather Smith, an evolutionary anatomist, became fascinated with the appendix after undergoing an emergency appendectomy as a child. Despite the common belief that the appendix is useless and can cause pain, recent research suggests that it actually serves important functions. The appendix is located at McBurney's point, about two-thirds of the way down between the bellybutton and the right pelvis. It has evolved independently multiple times throughout mammalian evolution, indicating that it must serve some beneficial role. The appendix supports the immune system by containing a high concentration of immune tissue, helping to fight against harmful substances in the gut. It also acts as a safe reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria during gastrointestinal distress, preventing them from being flushed out of the system. Understanding the functions of the appendix could lead to future advancements in preventing or treating appendicitis without emergency surgery.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses the embryology of different body parts, such as the uvula and appendix. They explain that these structures are formed through a process of fusion and development. The uvula is where the fusion of the two sides of the face completes, while the appendix is where the three tiniae coli meet. Both the uvula and the appendix contain lymphoid tissue. The author, a pathologist, dismisses the idea that the appendix is a mysterious evolutionary organ and advises against investing in related medical concepts.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article from 2007 discusses how the appendix, often considered useless, actually serves as a safe house for beneficial bacteria in the human gut. The gut is home to various microbes that aid in digestion, and the appendix provides nourishment and protection to these bacteria. The immune system cells present in the appendix are believed to protect the good bacteria instead of causing harm.

### Summary

 This article discusses a web-based SQLite database browser that is written in Python. The developers of this browser value user feedback and take it seriously. They provide documentation with information about available qualifiers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two websites that allow users to view the contents of their SQLite databases directly in their web browsers. The first website is called sqliteviewer.app, which works entirely client-side using Webassembly. Users can upload their Firefox `places.sqlite` file and select the `moz_places` table to load its contents. However, there is a caution about trusting the website with your browsing history since it is not open source. The second website, inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer, is open source but uses a JavaScript reimplementation of SQLite instead of true SQLite in Webassembly.

## 8. [Simple Precision Time Protocol at Meta](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39298652)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses the development of Simple Precision Time Protocol (SPTP), which is a simplified version of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) used in data center deployments. The author explains that while PTP offers flexibility and compatibility with various equipment, it also comes with complexity and excessive network communication. SPTP, on the other hand, reduces the number of exchanges between server and client, resulting in more efficient network communication. The article describes the exchange process in SPTP and explains how the client can calculate path delay and clock offset after every exchange. Overall, SPTP aims to address the limitations and tradeoffs of PTP in data center environments.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and proposes a solution called SPTP. The author points out that PTP unicast mode can be exploited for DDoS attacks due to its traffic amplification capabilities. While SPTP addresses this issue, it still has a 2:1 amplification problem. The author suggests that the NTP interleaved mode would be a better alternative. Additionally, they argue that the PTP offset calculation in SPTP assumes a constant delay, which is problematic when the delay distribution is not symmetric. The author proposes encapsulating NTP messages in PTP packets to take advantage of existing PTP support in hardware. They mention an IETF draft that specifies this approach and highlight experimental support for NTP-over-PTP in the latest chrony release.
