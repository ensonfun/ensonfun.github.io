## 1. [Why SQLite Uses Bytecode](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40206752)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 This article discusses the concept of prepared statements in SQL database engines, specifically focusing on two common methods of implementing them: bytecode and tree-of-objects. It explains that a prepared statement is an object that represents the steps necessary to execute an SQL statement and clarifies that even though different database engines may use different terminology, the concept of prepared statements exists across all systems. The article then explores the advantages and disadvantages of both bytecode and tree-of-objects representations. It notes that SQLite uses bytecode, which includes both low-level and high-level operations specific to database engines. On the other hand, MySQL and PostgreSQL use tree-of-objects, which involves an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the SQL statement and requires transformations and optimizations before execution. The article concludes by mentioning that the term "AST" may be misused when referring to the tree of objects used in MySQL and PostgreSQL.

## 9. [I Built an Ld_preload Worm](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40203676)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's accidental rediscovery of a proof-of-concept code they developed in the late 1990s. The code, called unicorns.so, is an LD_PRELOAD worm that exploits the transitive trust in Unix-like systems. The code had three components: one to hide its existence, one to inject hidden commands into SSH connections, and one to intercept the execution of su or sudo programs. The author's motivation was to demonstrate the fragility of distributed trust and criticize the use of su and sudo instead of logging in as root. The code remained unpublished, but the author mentions that the problems it addressed are less pressing in the current era of shared-use Unix systems.
