## 1. [Keep Android Open](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47091419)

**Total comment counts : 34**

### Summary

 At FOSDEM, F-Droid users wrongly believed Google canceled Android lockdown; plans remain, fueling concerns about misinformation and gatekeeping. In response, F-Droid and IzzyOnDroid are adding banners warning of shrinking time and urging civic action. Development continues: F-Droid Basic is moving to 2.0-alpha3 with a manual upgrade path. The team reports steady app updates (Buses 1.10, Conversations 2.19.10+free, Dolphin Emulator 2512, Nextcloud suite, ProtonVPN 5.15.70.0 with WireGuard) and explores a “Play Store flavor” avoiding Google dependencies. Overall, efforts emphasize openness and reducing proprietary dependencies.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on Google's plan to restrict sideloading and the threat this poses to an open Android ecosystem, including the viability of AOSP forks and community/regulatory responses.
- Concern: The primary worry is that verification requirements could lock out de-Googled distributions and erode user freedom by making Android effectively closed.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from urging a hard fork or foundation-led open Android (e.g., through F-Droid or PinePhone) and regulatory pressure, to accepting Google's direction, drawing comparisons to Apple and noting practical barriers.
- Overall sentiment: Highly critical

## 2. [Turn Dependabot Off](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47094192)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 Dependabot is a noise machine that wastes time on Go security alerts. Replace it with scheduled GitHub Actions running govulncheck and your test suite against the latest dependencies. The filippo.io/edwards25519 vulnerability showed how Dependabot can generate thousands of irrelevant PRs and dubious scores (Wycheproof alert). Govulncheck filters by package and symbol reachability, avoiding false positives. Integrate via govulncheck -json or the golang.org/x/vuln/scan Go API. Only true vulnerabilities should trigger remediation; update timing should align with your development cycle, not dependency churn.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion revolves around improving Rust/Cargo supply chain security by seeking a govulncheck-like tool for Rust, evaluating the sandboxed-step action, and balancing dependency updates to reduce risk.  
- Concern: There is concern that using third-party actions and speeding up dependency upgrades could introduce new supply chain vulnerabilities.  
- Perspectives: Views diverge between those who welcome tooling like govulncheck equivalents and weekly Dependabot cadence, and those who prefer avoiding external actions and are wary of rapid upgrades.  
- Overall sentiment: Cautiously optimistic

- Concern: Retroactive changes and doxxing threaten the trustworthiness of archived pages and raise safety and ethical issues around how archiving services are used.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from condemning retroactive edits and harassment, to defending archiving practices and advocating safer alternatives, to debating best practices like dual labeling or alternative services to preserve access.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 5. [I found a Vulnerability. They found a Lawyer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47092578)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 While diving near Cocos Island, I found vulnerability in a diving insurer’s member portal. The login relied on incrementing IDs and static default passwords, with no MFA, rate limiting, or lockout. When I registered three students, their IDs were sequential, and many accounts still used the default password, exposing profiles (name, DOB, address, phone, email) and minor data. I automated a verification with Selenium to confirm scope, never accessing beyond it, and deleted any data. I reported to CSIRT Malta and disclosed on Apr 28, 2025; embargo expired May 28, 2025; issue addressed; seeking confirmation of user notifications.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: There is a broad, ongoing debate about how vulnerability disclosure should work, who bears responsibility when flaws are found, and how laws, insurance, and organizational practices shape incentives for security researchers.
- Concern: The main worry is that current legal threats and corporate resistance discourage disclosure, leaving critical vulnerabilities unpatched and potentially undermining national and customer security.
- Perspectives: Different viewpoints range from calling for strong protections for white-hat researchers, mandatory cyber audits for organizations and safer reporting channels, to criticisms that lawyers and insurance incentives push companies to suppress information and hinder practical security improvement.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [Facebook is cooked](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47091748)

**Total comment counts : 110**

### Summary

 After eight years away, the author returns to Facebook and finds the main feed flooded with AI-generated thirst traps and engagement bait, not posts from friends. A few non-AI posts slip through, including an AI video of a cop returning a boy’s bike, but most content is lurid or relationship-meme clutter. The author questions whether the AI-driven algorithm is behind it and worries some posts may be real, not bots. Disgusted by underage-looking AI images, they quit Facebook for good—until school updates force a re-entry.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether Facebook's evolving algorithms and design have degraded feeds for many users, while still delivering meaningful connections for a minority.
- Concern: The main worry is that engagement-driven recommendations, biases by gender or region, and AI-generated content are harming user experience and public discourse.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from nostalgia for the “Peak Facebook” era and meaningful private sharing to widespread frustration at noise, manipulation, and a bloated UI, with notes about global usage patterns and gender effects.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
