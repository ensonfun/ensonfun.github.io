## 4. [Show HN: AI dub tool I made to watch foreign language videos with my 7-year-old](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39512912)

**Total comment counts : 50**

### Summary

 The article discusses a tool called Speakz, which can translate videos from one language to another while preserving the original voices and other sounds. The tool was created by a developer who wanted to watch YouTube content with his German-speaking daughter without constantly interrupting the video for translation. Speakz currently supports various languages for both input and output. Translating videos manually usually takes several hours, but Speakz is much faster, taking approximately two times the length of the video to generate a translation. The tool also allows creators to reach more audiences by adding multiple audio tracks in different languages to their videos. The pricing for Speakz is yet to be determined but is expected to be around $5 per hour per language, with possible discounts for translating the same video into multiple languages or for volume translations.

## 8. [New FCC Broadband Standards Should Consider Latency](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39533800)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been urged to consider latency, the time it takes for data to be routed, in addition to speed when defining broadband metrics. The FCC's proposed draft order aims to increase the national broadband speed standard but does not specify explicit latency requirements. The draft report acknowledges feedback from respondents who support incorporating latency into the commission's annual report on advanced telecommunication capabilities. Some commentators argue that considering service quality factors like latency would go beyond the original purpose of the assessment, while others emphasize the importance of balancing speed and bandwidth with minimizing latency. They highlight that real-time applications, such as video conferencing and online gaming, are more sensitive to latency. Fiber optic cables offer the lowest latency among wired connections.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author shares their experience with Starlink internet service, stating that they have been monitoring connection metrics closely. They find latency measurement and packet loss to be more useful than throughput. Over the past month, they have averaged 0.6% packet loss, 38ms latency, and 130/20 MBit/s in Grass Valley, CA. The author mentions that packet loss increases in the evenings, which indicates congestion problems. They also emphasize the importance of latency variance or jitter, stating that a steady 50ms is better than a connection that constantly fluctuates between 20-80ms. In terms of bandwidth, the author finds measuring "hours under 20 Mbps download" to be useful, noting that they only experience 1 or 2 instances a day on their Starlink connection. Lastly, the author mentions that IRTT is a great tool for measuring latency and packet loss, but running a server is required. They have a server in the same datacenter as the Starlink terrestrial POP.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the importance of low latency in remote work, as it can be disruptive in video meetings. Additionally, the author mentions the significance of internet "brown outs," short instances of internet dropouts, which can be irritating during meetings. The frequency of these dropouts varies across different locations.

## 9. [JEP 467: Markdown Documentation Comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39531600)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article proposes enabling JavaDoc documentation comments to be written in Markdown instead of solely using a mixture of HTML and JavaDoc tags. This would make API documentation comments easier to write and read in source code. The article suggests extending the Compiler Tree API to allow other tools that analyze documentation comments to handle Markdown content. HTML was chosen as the markup language for documentation comments in Java code in 1995, but it has become less popular and tedious to write and read. Markdown, on the other hand, is easy to read, write, and transform into HTML. By allowing Markdown in documentation comments, developers can use simpler syntax for common constructs and reduce the need for HTML and JavaDoc tags, while still being able to use specialized tags for features not supported by Markdown. The article provides an example of converting a documentation comment to Markdown syntax and highlights the differences between the two versions. Markdown documentation comments would be written in the CommonMark variant of Markdown and would support enhancements to links and GFM pipe tables, as well as all JavaDoc tags.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses excitement about using Markdown instead of HTML for writing Javadoc in Java. They find HTML to be distracting and prefer the simplicity and ease of use of Markdown. The author mentions that Markdown was designed to address the problem of ugly and distracting inline HTML. They also discuss their personal preference for certain Markdown syntax, suggesting alternatives to the heavy visual appearance of certain characters. Overall, the author is eager for the implementation of Markdown in their work.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of using fenced code blocks as @snippet tags, although it is not mentioned in the JEP (Java Enhancement Proposal). The author suggests that fenced code blocks could be a better option for code quoting in Markdown. However, they mention that some JavaScript highlighting libraries, like PRISM.js, can strip pre-existing HTML in the code, which can interfere with the @link tag. Highlight.js, on the other hand, is not affected by this issue. The article includes references to JEP 413 and provides links to PRISM.js and Highlight.js.

## 10. [Neanderthals' use of complex adhesives shows high cognitive abilities](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39515087)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 error

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the adhesives found in Le Moustier could have been created by early modern humans instead of Neanderthals. The lack of radiometric dates for the assemblage and the presence of Homo sapiens incursions in southern Europe raise doubts about the authorship of the adhesives. The author also criticizes an article on phys.org for not mentioning this information and speculates that many stories about Neanderthals being more advanced may actually be due to modern humans leaving Africa earlier than previously thought.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article is recommending the novel "No Enemy But Time" by Michael Bishop, which won the 1982 Nebula Award for Best Novel. The plot synopsis states that the novel follows the story of a modern black American man who has the ability to mentally project himself back to pre-human Africa. He meets and eventually mates with humanity's prehistoric ancestors. The protagonist, Joshua Kampa, is the illegitimate son of a mute Spanish whore and a black serviceman. He dreams of an Africa in the past in such vivid and hallucinatory detail that he questions the understanding of eminent paleontologists. As a result, he is invited to join a time travel project and is transported millions of years into the past.
