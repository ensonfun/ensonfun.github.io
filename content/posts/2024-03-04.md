**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 A French court has ordered Orange, a major telecom provider, to pay €500,000 in compensatory damages and €150,000 for moral damages for infringing the copyright of Entr'Ouvert's Lasso software and violating the GPL. This case, which began in 2010, involved Orange using the Lasso software in a government portal without passing on the rights to its modifications or making the source code available. The Appeals Court initially rejected Entr'Ouvert's claims for copyright infringement, but the decision was overturned by the Court of Cassation. The compensatory damages were based on lost profits and disgorgement of profits.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a problem encountered with a codec chip. The output needed to be at 48 kHz, but there was not enough CPU power to process the input at the same frequency. The solution was to use a large FIR anti-aliasing filter on the codec chip. The author mentions the benefits of using FIR filters, such as a sharp cutoff and linear phase. They also reflect on their learning experience and mention that they would have tried Bessel filters if they had known about them at the time.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses several key points, including the preference for Bessel filters over Butterworth filters, the idea of lowering Fc (cutoff frequency) and increasing Fs (sampling frequency) instead of increasing filter order, and the importance of considering both time domain and frequency domain when choosing a filter. The article also mentions a dense interview question that assesses knowledge in this area, specifically asking about choosing the stopband attenuation of a filter. Stopband attenuation is seen as the most relevant factor in determining the magnitude of noise in the sampled signal and is an upper bound on the performance of downstream algorithms.

## 5. [Motion blur all the way down (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39586828)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of motion blur and its application in animation. It explores the relationship between natural motion blur and artificial motion blur, and suggests a method for simulating the most natural-looking motion blur. The article also introduces the idea of a "shutter function" to minimize artifacts and improve the perceptual similarity between a video and a natural scene. The author then goes on to describe their attempt at creating an infinite motion blur animation using a realtime shader.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the tradeoff of incorporating motion blur in rendered or filmed content on screens with finite refresh rates. It highlights that when viewers move their eyes to track a moving object, it becomes sharp in real life. To accurately represent this in visuals, one would either need to track eye motion and blur accordingly or have no motion blur with an infinite refresh rate, but both options are currently impractical with existing technology. Therefore, achieving the correct look will always be a challenge. The article suggests that a skilled director or game designer should choose the shutter rate or render blur based on their understanding of how the audience's eyes will move.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of this article expresses skepticism about the use of motion blur in video games. They argue that while motion blur can enhance realism in certain situations, such as fast or close movements, its excessive use in video games can make them appear like poorly edited movies. The author also mentions that when they turn their head or eyes, they don't see a blurry image but rather a clear, new image, as their brain disregards the transitional phase. They suggest looking in a mirror to confirm this experience. The author concludes by stating that motion blur in video games is distracting and unrealistic, as it delays the presentation of the new view when the player moves their point of view.

### Summary

 The article discusses the history of Singapore Airlines' operation of the Concorde supersonic passenger airliner. It highlights the joint venture between Singapore Airlines and British Airways, which aimed to reduce travel times between Singapore and London from 18 hours to under 10 hours. However, the service faced challenges due to waning demand and rising fuel costs, leading to heavy losses. The article also mentions the politics involved in securing permissions and routes for the Concorde flights, including negotiations with the Singapore government and India's refusal to allow the aircraft to fly over its airspace. Ultimately, Singapore Airlines and British Airways agreed to a compromise, and the joint operation of the Concorde began in December 1977.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of reducing flight times between Singapore and London from 18 hours to 10 hours with the use of new aircraft. The author finds this interesting because current direct flights between the two cities are already around 13 hours. They express skepticism about paying high fares for a 3-hour reduction in flight time if it means traveling in a small and uncomfortable cabin with lower quality pressurization and ventilation compared to existing aircraft on the route.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Scientists have captured images of the largest documented anaconda species ever found in the Amazon of Ecuador. The University of Queensland team, led by Professor Bryan Fry, discovered the nearly 10-million-year-old species with the help of the Huaorani people while filming a National Geographic series. The team encountered a 6.3-meter-long female anaconda and captured several specimens of the species, which they named the northern green anaconda. The newly discovered species resides in the smaller basin in the northern Amazon, while the larger basin in the south is home to the green anaconda. The two species differ genetically by 5.5%. The team hopes to study the reproduction of the northern green anaconda for insights into the ecosystem's health. The findings have been published in the journal MDPI Diversity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a case in Florida where an 18-foot Burmese python was found to have swallowed a 5-foot alligator in the Everglades. The incident involved a python, not an anaconda. The author also mentions that this is not the only case of a gator being found in a snake in Florida, with another incident where a gator burst out of the snake.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mistakenly states that the Orinoco basin is part of the Amazon. However, the Orinoco river is an independent river and one of the largest in the world. It is the third or fourth largest river in terms of water discharge. The Orinoco river's discharge is only smaller than the Amazon and Congo rivers.
