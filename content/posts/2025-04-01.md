 The article discusses strategies for minimizing garbage collection (GC) times in Go applications. It emphasizes that the GC mark phase, which colors pointers starting from known live roots, is the main contributor to GC duration, while the sweep phase takes less time. To reduce GC time effectively, it's important to focus on minimizing long-lived allocations, as short-lived allocations do not significantly impact GC times since they are not reached during the mark phase. Although all allocations can trigger GC, completely avoiding it in applications is difficult. Therefore, optimizing for reduced GC mark times is more beneficial for improving performance.

## 10. [Excitable cells](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43504940)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses cardiac arrhythmias, focusing on reentrant arrhythmias, where heart muscles activate continuously in a self-sustaining loop independent of the normal pacemaking system. It differentiates between benign arrhythmias, like AV-nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), and life-threatening ones like ventricular fibrillation. The text explains the properties of heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) and how they can initiate and sustain arrhythmias through activation and refractory periods.

Using a simplified simulation model, it demonstrates how activated cells (depicted in black) trigger neighboring cells, creating complex patterns of activation. The article highlights the role of the sinoatrial node as the heart's natural pacemaker and how tachycardia occurs when this node fires faster than normal. 

It also explores the mechanism of reentry tachycardia, which requires a non-responsive area (like scar tissue) for the loop to form and sustain itself. The article illustrates that for a reentrant loop to start, the wave of depolarization must travel in one direction around the non-responsive area, taking advantage of cells with varying refractory periods. Finally, the piece mentions the process of defibrillation to restore normal sinus rhythm and addresses the complexity of rhythmic disturbances like fibrillation.
