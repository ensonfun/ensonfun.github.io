### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a natural nuclear fission reactor that occurred on Earth. This reactor formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became flooded with groundwater, which acted as a moderator for the neutrons produced by nuclear fission. The reaction produced heat that caused the groundwater to boil away, slowing or stopping the reaction. After the mineral deposit cooled, the water returned, and the reaction restarted, completing a cycle every 3 hours. The reaction continued for hundreds of thousands of years until the decreasing fissile materials and the buildup of neutron poisons prevented the sustainment of a chain reaction. Overall, it is an intriguing natural phenomenon.
