### Summary

 The article is about a denied access to a certain web page. It suggests visiting a link for more information on how to restore access and guidelines for harvesting content.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the claim that a room temperature superconductor exists and the attempts to replicate it. The production method is poorly documented, and only a fraction of the samples show interesting properties. There are variations in the results, and none of the attempts fully demonstrate the spectrum of properties and behaviors of a true superconductor at room temperature. The author believes that there is likely something interesting but not well understood about the samples. The best case scenario is that the original sample in the Korean lab is a true room temperature superconductor, while the worst case scenario is that it is another class of high temperature superconductor with limited applications.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the discovery of a new superconductor, LK99, which has a high temperature limit of around 138 K (-135 °C). While this is still far from room temperature, the article suggests that it is a significant discovery in the field of superconductivity. The author believes that once a new superconductor is validated, there are often methods discovered to improve its temperature or optimize other properties. The positive news of this discovery, along with recent simulation studies, leads the author to increase their belief that LK99 or a related descendant could eventually be a step towards achieving room temperature superconductivity.

## 2. [A non-mathematical introduction to Kalman filters for programmers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36971975)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of Kalman Filters and their importance in processing and combining multiple sources of imperfect and unreliable information to generate a more accurate estimate. It provides an accessible and intuitive explanation of Kalman Filters using a simple example of a ship's location estimation. The article also introduces the concept of weighted averaging and variance as key components of the Kalman Filter algorithm. The article concludes by highlighting the power of coding as a language to enhance understanding and intuition in complex concepts like Kalman Filters.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article the user is referring to contains several mistakes in its implementation. The main error is that it fails to propagate uncertainty forward in time, leading to an underestimation of the error. This is evident in the plots, as the error bounds do not cover the true state most of the time. Additionally, the article misrepresents how passengers estimate their position by adding random fluctuations, while in reality, they use the expected value of the state at the next time step based on the current state. The article also suggests that GPS is influenced by weather, which is a common misconception. Finally, the definition of consistency used in the article is non-standard, as true consistency in estimation theory means that the estimator converges to the true value as more data is gathered. The user, who is a graduate student in estimation theory, offers to provide further clarification on these matters.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is impressed by the simplicity with which the Kalman Filters are explained and wonders why signal processing teachers in college do not use this approach. They acknowledge that mathematical concepts are typically taught mathematically, but this can result in information loss for those who do not have the necessary background knowledge. The author also suggests that teaching methods involving intuition before rigor, such as using images to teach concepts like Discrete Cosine Transform and Wavelet Transform, may be more effective.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the idea that the "Safari is the new IE" narrative is not entirely accurate. It points out that Safari not supporting certain APIs does not automatically make it the same as Internet Explorer (IE). It states that IE was not initially seen as an inferior browser, but rather became disliked due to its departure from standards and imposition of its own web vision because of its dominant market share. The article suggests that Microsoft may have intentionally stagnated IE to prevent competition with its desktop apps business, while Google's motivation for potentially becoming the new IE may be centered around data collection and advertising. In conclusion, the article argues that Chrome, not Safari, is the new IE, but emphasizes the importance of understanding history to properly evaluate the comparison.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes the use of Google Chrome by tech-savvy individuals. It argues that if people stopped using Chrome and made excuses to justify its dominance, Google wouldn't be as powerful as it is today. The author suggests that using Chrome with ad-blocking software is a lazy choice. They mention that alternative browsers like Safari and Firefox have been good options since 2023. The article also references Dante's "Divina Commedia" to illustrate a point about laziness.

## 5. [Hackers manage to unlock Tesla software-locked features](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36988262)

**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

 A group of hackers has discovered an exploit that can unlock Tesla's software-locked features, including heated seats and the Full Self-Driving package, which is worth up to $15,000. This exploit is possible because Tesla vehicles have the same hardware, and owners can unlock features later through software updates. The hackers plan to present their findings next week, revealing that their "Tesla Jailbreak" is "unpatchable" and gives users the ability to run arbitrary software on the infotainment system. The hack requires physical access to the car and involves a voltage fault injection attack on the AMD-based infotainment system. The hackers believe they can unlock all software-locked features, including Full Self-Driving, but it would require more reverse-engineering. Despite the exploit, the hackers acknowledge that Tesla's security is better than other automakers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a low voltage attack on the AMD secure execution environment during boot. The author questions the number of attempts needed to place the bits correctly and suggests that cutting 12V wires might be sufficient. The article highlights the claim that this attack could allow the theft of the RSA private key owned by a car, potentially posing a security concern for Tesla and its vehicle security. However, it also mentions that post jailbreak, one could potentially hide their location on Tesla's servers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the issue of software locks and their implications. It argues that building cars in a uniform way for cost-saving purposes is acceptable. It also acknowledges that software unlocks for hardware already owned can be justified. However, the article criticizes the use of software locks to rent-seek on one-time costs, such as heated seats, particularly if the subscription can't be transferred to the secondary market. It warns that this practice can hinder secondary markets by disabling certain features. The article concludes by advocating for an end to this type of practice.

## 10. [The infamous coin toss](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36979190)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of ergodicity breaking in economics and introduces the "Peters coin toss" as an example. In this gamble, a fair coin is tossed, and if it lands on heads, 50% is added to the current wealth, while if it lands on tails, 40% is subtracted. The article explores the implications of averaging wealth over many different systems versus averaging over time and highlights the non-ergodic nature of the gamble. It explains that while wealth averaged over many systems grows at a rate of 5% per round, wealth averaged in one system over a long period of time decreases at roughly 5% per round. The writer emphasizes the significance of ergodicity breaking in understanding economic growth processes, questioning mainstream economic decision theories based on expected value, and addressing conflicts between individual and collective interests. The article also mentions various extensions and applications of the Peters coin toss, such as Kelly betting, optimal leverage, cooperation puzzles, and wealth inequality dynamics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the results of a simulation that examines the distribution of wealth. After running the simulation with 100,000 iterations, it is found that the average net worth increases, but the distribution of wealth is skewed. Only 13,704 individuals have a net worth of more than $1, while 53,935 have a net worth of less than $0.01. The investor who made the most money had a net worth of $1,171,830. The median wealth of all investors was $0.00515378. The article argues that the wild income distribution is caused by the fact that the average log(wealth) decreases over time. The author also mentions that most figures from the simulation are highly variable, and increasing wealth concentration is an inherent aspect of capitalism. The suggested solution to this issue, albeit sarcastically, is to "eat the rich."

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article talks about how the choice of +50%/-40% in a bet is clever because it appears advantageous for the gambler based on the naive expected value. However, if the bet was changed to "double your money" (+100%), it becomes clear that the fair downside would be "halve your money" (-50%). The article explains that in order to balance out increases and decreases in repeated games, the percentage differences need to be much greater than just a 10% difference.
