## 1. [Claude for Chrome](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45030760)

**Total comment counts : 50**

### Summary

 Anthropic is piloting Claude for Chrome to work directly in browsers, starting with 1,000 Max plan users via a controlled test and a waitlist. They view browser-enabled AI as inevitable but require stronger safety safeguards. In red-team tests, prompt injection attacks—where malicious content manipulates actions—showed a 23.6% success rate without mitigations across 123 test cases and 29 scenarios; a malicious email could trigger mass deletion. Defenses include granular permissions, improved system prompts, blocking high-risk sites, and advanced classifiers. With mitigations, attack rate dropped to 11.2% overall and 0% on four browser-specific vectors. The pilot will expand as safety improves.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author describes building a similar extension that supports many models, including Claude, to control a user’s browser with mouse/keyboard input and observation. It’s a useful project for understanding how these systems work. They argue current tech isn’t ready: web pages offer far less information density than documents or code, so better page representations or stronger models are needed for robust results. Projects like Dia, Comet, Browser Use, and Gemini are making progress. Some models are already fine-tuned for web tasks, memorizing selectors (e.g., ".gLFyf"). See the browserbee GitHub repo.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author tests Claude navigating browsers via MCP integrations and Python tests. Claude quickly loses thread during complex browser tasks, with a lot of visual and contextual information vanishing. Forcing new browser context windows between screenshots modestly improves performance, but results remain weak. The author believes real progress would come when Claude can operate in the browser and reliably understand five consecutive radio buttons, though they have not yet seen evidence of such evaluation.

It’s available now through the Gemini API, Google AI Studio for developers, and Vertex AI for enterprise, priced at $30 per 1M output tokens (each image ~1290 tokens, about $0.039). The release adds enhanced build-mode in AI Studio, improved character consistency, and visual template support, plus multi-image fusion and precise local edits. Watermarked with SynthID; preview now, stable soon; partnerships with OpenRouter.ai and fal.ai.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The piece claims a breakthrough moment in image-editing AI, praising Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash) as exceptionally strong. It reports a 171 Elo-point jump in lmarena and urges readers to check Twitter for demonstrations, providing an example tweet link.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 An updated GenAI Image comparison site now includes Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (nano-banana). It solves 8 of 12 prompts and is a significant upgrade over Gemini Flash 2.0, approaching best-in-class Imagen and gpt-image-1. The reigning champ, gpt-image-1, still edges Flash 2.5 on the maze and 9-pointed star, though it’s been top for about six months. Note: gpt-image-1 is poor as an editor, often replacing entire images rather than performing localized edits. A comparison of the three models is available.

## 4. [What happens when ambassadors are summoned by the host country?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45031496)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 An article explains how countries "summon" ambassadors to foreign ministries—a largely ceremonial, theatrical gesture to express displeasure. Usually a formal note invites the representative to a meeting, with the substance of the exchange more important than the label. The BBC interviews depict the ritual: waiting in grand offices, pre-scripted talking points, not a real fight. Examples include the US summoning Japan’s Fujisaki in 2009 (disputed as a "summoning"), the UK in Cairo, and the Christmas 2016 Israel-wide summons. Ambassadors brief their home governments afterward.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author enjoys the theater of international diplomacy, noting it is both humorous and depressing and bears similarities to a schoolyard.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece notes that the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland was almost never summoned, but argues that the new 50% tariffs will likely change that, making such summons more common.

## 5. [Why do people keep writing about the imaginary compound Cr2Gr2Te6?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45030144)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 An author highlights a recurring error: Cr2Ge2Te6 vs Cr2Gr2Te6 in discussions of intrinsic ferromagnetism in 2D magnets since 2017. Cr2Gr2Te6 is incorrect; Gr isn’t an element. The mistake appears across Science and multiple papers, likely from typos or AI propagation, and may have bypassed peer review. The piece urges careful verification of chemical names and terminology (compound vs alloy/telluride) to prevent misinformation from spreading.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article notes that Laurent Bossavit wrote a book examining similar cases in the IT world, titled "The Leprechauns of Software Engineering: How folklore turns into fact and what to do about it."

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece compares the “Gr” in science journals to Van Halen’s brown M&M rider, claiming it signals that reviewers and authors often submit sloppy, copied content. It provocatively suggests established scientists should deliberately include obvious mistakes to see how far such errors propagate through the literature.

## 6. [One universal antiviral to rule them all?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45026792)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Columbia immunologist Dusan Bogunovic linked a rare ISG15 deficiency to a broad, mild antiviral state that can suppress many viruses without severe illness. Building on this, his team developed an mRNA-based therapy in lipid nanoparticles that briefly triggers production of 10 antiviral proteins. In mice and hamsters, intranasal delivery before infection blocked influenza and SARS-CoV-2 replication and reduced disease, with limited inflammation. The approach aims for universal, short-term antiviral protection for pandemics, especially for high-risk groups, though delivery and duration (about 3–4 days) require optimization.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Researchers examined patients’ immune cells and found signatures of exposure to various viruses (flu, measles, mumps, chickenpox) despite no reported illness. The study notes mild persistent inflammation and raises the possibility of asymptomatic but contagious viral carriage. It discusses immunizing healthcare workers in a future pandemic, but warns that vaccines aimed at preventing symptoms rather than infection could inadvertently create a workforce of asymptomatic transmitters akin to Typhoid Mary.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece asks what would happen if humanity could wipe out all viruses. It considers whether viruses help regulate other threats and what unintended, negative consequences might result from their elimination.

## 7. [Undisclosed financial conflicts of interest in DSM-5 (2024)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45029241)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 Intended for healthcare professionals, this cross-sectional study used the Open Payments database (2016–2019) to quantify financial ties to industry among American Psychiatric Association DSM-5-TR panelists and task-force members (n=92 US physicians). Of these, 55 (60%) received industry payments. Panel members collectively received $14.2 million, while 33.3% of task-force members had payments reported. The authors conclude conflicts of interest were prevalent and argue for strict COI safeguards in guideline development, including a rebuttable presumption against industry ties for DSM panel members; industry-affiliated individuals could consult but not influence revisions or additions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author questions whether much of the DSM is built on weak, unreplicated, or fraudulent research, casting doubt on psychiatric diagnoses. They liken our understanding of the brain to our knowledge of mitochondria, noting that mitochondrial findings are frequently reported, suggesting brain science may be similarly uncertain.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author questions whether the DSM-5 revision from DSM-IV was tainted by the authors’ ties to pharma or other industries. They seek concrete examples of DSM-5 being written to harm or help commercial interests, and express that the DSM-5 material is tedious to read.

## 8. [Michigan Supreme Court: Unrestricted phone searches violate Fourth Amendment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45029764)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 Michigan's Supreme Court in People v. Carson ruled that police may not issue broad digital-search warrants. Warrants must be specific, listing exactly what data types or timeframes are being searched and why they’re relevant to the crime. In the case, investigators obtained a warrant allowing access to all data on a suspect’s phone, producing over a thousand pages unrelated to the theft; the court deemed this unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment’s requirement of particularity. Given smartphones’ wealth of private information, digital searches must be precise, with magistrates ensuring a factual basis for access. (Intervenors included EFF and ACLU.)

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 A detective sought a warrant to search a suspect’s phone for evidence of assault on a family member. The affidavit offered essentially no probable cause beyond vague claims about the ubiquity of cell phones. The magistrate denied the warrant, but the author notes this reflects a troubling pattern of law enforcement cutting corners to justify broad searches of cell phones.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Michael Carson is under investigation for allegedly stealing from a neighbor’s safe. A warrant to search his phone allowed investigators to access all data on the device—messages, photos, contacts, and documents—without any time or relevance limits. They collected over a thousand pages of material, much of it unrelated to the accusation, drawing criticism for how broad the search was.

## 9. [Neuralink 'Participant 1' says his life has changed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45002688)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 Fortune writer Jessica Mathews profiles Noland Arbaugh, the first person to receive Neuralink’s brain-chip implant. In January 2024, Arbaugh, a 31-year-old tetraplegic from Yuma, underwent a sub-two-hour surgery at Barrow Neurological Institute to implant a Neuralink device with more than 1,000 electrodes in the motor cortex. The wireless chip records neural activity and translates it into device commands, enabling Arbaugh to control a computer, play Mario Kart, and turn devices on and off. The chip is battery-powered and charges about every five hours via a hat-integrated coil. Since P1, eight more participants have joined trials across several countries.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 A blind person expresses a strong desire to regain sight, preferring to let others go first but eager to experience vision. They want to drive, read body language, and play any video game, showing enthusiastic anticipation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 An extensive YouTube podcast featuring the entire team and Noland (about eight hours) offers perspectives from the chief brain surgeon, hardware and software teams, and Noland himself. It explains what’s possible, the steps needed to reach it, and how this research could positively impact people with severe medical conditions.

## 10. [US Intel](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45024786)

**Total comment counts : 37**

### Summary

 Using steelmanning, the author weighs the proposal for the U.S. to take a 10% stake in Intel. Critics like Lincicome highlight downsides, but the piece argues you must address the strongest counterarguments, given how chip geopolitics tie to Taiwan, China, and AI. Foundries matter; Taiwan’s TSMC and Samsung locations complicate U.S. security. The author previously argued for making China more dependent on U.S. chip firms and TSMC—though not as a policy endorsement here but to preserve AI dominance—yet this risk hinges on China’s choice to act against Taiwan, with waiting potentially increasing China’s advantages.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 An analysis warns Intel’s strategy may fail, while China concerns are real and Intel Foundry needs guarantees of ongoing viability to attract customers. Exiting would leave the U.S. dependent on foreign firms for crucial tech, with long-term, potentially catastrophic consequences. Critics blame a rushed pivot to Asia that neglected domestic capacity, arguing no startup can replace Intel and that outsourcing essential metallurgical strength could threaten national security.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece argues that the main reason for the U.S. to own part of Intel is to ensure Intel Foundry’s continuity. It cautions that recent months show US policy can be deliberate yet unpredictable, reversing decisions. Any push to require selling in the U.S. market would need solid commercial returns, which aren’t currently assured. Moreover, Intel would take years to become a viable foundry with customer products, and there may be higher costs compared with established high-volume foundries, making the investment hard to justify now.
