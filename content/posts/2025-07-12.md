### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the Post Office leadership's misunderstanding of franchise ownership's motivations, perceiving it as an opportunity for theft rather than a means to earn a middle-class income. They failed to grasp that people were essentially "buying a job" that required substantial investment and long hours. This bias led them to incorrectly assume that postmasters were stealing, resulting in a focus on detecting fraud through accounting software. When the software reported significant missing funds, the leaders saw it as validation of their suspicions instead of questioning the software itself.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author criticizes the suggestion of a 1 product manager to 0.5 engineers ratio, expressing disbelief at the idea. They recount their experience with product managers, asserting that most are detrimental to projects and lack practical skills. The author argues that middle managers are inefficient and that replacing experienced developers with them would be a poor decision.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses skepticism towards two main points made by Ng in a video. First, he claims that AI has accelerated fast prototyping for app development, which the author believes has never been a bottleneck in his experience, suggesting that idea validation can be effectively done through wireframing. Second, Ng promotes the idea that everyone in a company should code, a concept the author argues has failed historically, resulting in false confidence and misunderstandings about engineering roles.

## 9. [Repasting a MacBook](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44531569)

**Total comment counts : 30**

### Summary

 An iOS developer reflects on their M1 Pro MacBook Pro, noting its impressive performance and quiet fans in 2021, which have since degraded. Despite interest in upgrading, the laptop still handles demanding tasks well. The author identifies aging thermal paste as the reason for increased fan noise and attempts to replace it, discovering a special compound used by Apple. While replacing the paste, they accidentally damaged a delicate fan cable, requiring a full disassembly for a fan replacement. The process was challenging but ultimately successful, with the author regaining control over CPU thermals.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 For fanless Air models, a common hack involves placing thermal pads between the CPU heatspreader and the case to enhance heat dissipation, allowing longer performance before throttling. However, this makes the bottom of the laptop quite hot to the touch. Using a plastic hardshell can mitigate this issue while also providing protection.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their experience repairing a 2012 MacBook Pro, noting that disassembling and reassembling it, as well as replacing the battery and upgrading components, was straightforward. In contrast, they criticize the 2017 MacBook Pro for its poor quality and difficult repairability. They inquire whether the newer M3 and M4 models have improved in terms of ease of disassembly and battery replacement, referencing a concern about fragile ribbon cables in the M1 model.

## 10. [Preliminary report into Air India crash released](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44536459)

**Total comment counts : 53**

### Summary

 A preliminary report on the Air India crash that killed 260 people revealed that both fuel switches were in the cut-off position before the incident. Cockpit audio indicated confusion between the pilots regarding the switches' status. Families of the victims are demanding answers and justice, amid ongoing investigations by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau and the US National Transportation Safety Board. While the report raises concerns, the aviation minister urges cautious interpretation as the investigation continues, with a final report expected next year. Grieving families express profound loss and a desire for accountability.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the implications of a potential murder-suicide involving a pilot, highlighting the FAA's policy that revokes pilot licenses for seeking mental health treatment. It argues that this policy encourages pilots to conceal mental health issues, which can lead to tragic outcomes. The Pilot Mental Health Campaign is advocating for HR 2591, the "Mental Health in Aviation Act of 2025," which has been approved for a general vote. The author hopes for its passage to encourage reform in mental health policies for pilots worldwide.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a power loss incident caused by fuel cut-off switches that were mistakenly set to "cut-off" but were later restored to "run." Pilot dialogue and telemetry confirm this issue, raising questions about how the pilot recognized the problem amidst various alerts during a critical moment. The author speculates on the likelihood of a pilot noticing the flipped switches, given their training focuses on other emergencies and memory items. Additionally, it questions why the first pilot noticed the cut-off but did not promptly adjust the switches to "run."
