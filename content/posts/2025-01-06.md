### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a unique feature within a game called "Stimulation Clicker" by Neal.fun, which includes a hidden 40-minute parody podcast on true crime with a mermaid theme. This podcast appears to be custom-made for the game as there are no external references to the characters or content online. The podcast can be accessed via a direct link, but the author advises caution regarding bandwidth usage. Additionally, the article mentions a humorous line from the podcast, "Aww, he was all cat 'n tonic when he first saw her," expressing curiosity and appreciation for the creativity behind this hidden gem.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a clicker game that appears to satirize the overwhelming and addictive nature of internet content. Despite initial reactions of the game being an overwhelming or negative reflection of internet culture, it has been popular enough to reach the front page. The game features various content creators in a way that seems to critique the internet's role in fostering addiction, yet it also gives these creators a positive mention, adding to the game's ironic tone. At the game's conclusion, players are shown a serene ocean scene, which contrasts sharply with the preceding chaos of the game, highlighting a human tendency to seek tranquility but often get distracted by trivial pursuits. The author reflects on whether humanity's engagement with such games reveals a refusal to confront deeper issues or simply showcases our preference for engaging, albeit meaningless, activities over serene contemplation.

## 3. [Hitting OKRs vs. Doing Your Job](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607623)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 The article discusses the role of OKRs (Objectives & Key Results) in different departments, specifically contrasting their application in Engineering and Marketing:

1. **Engineering OKRs**: The author critiques the common practice of aligning engineering OKRs too closely with the product roadmap, suggesting this often results in redundancy. Instead, OKRs should highlight what's different or special about the current quarter, focusing on improvements, changes in process, or critical projects like the "Smooth launch of Frontend Observability." This OKR indicates a priority shift, emphasizing responsiveness and support for a key release.

2. **Marketing OKRs**: Here, OKRs serve a clearer purpose by defining new campaigns, audiences, or channels, thus focusing on shifts in strategy or targets. Marketing's core activities like running ads or webinars are ongoing, but OKRs specify what new efforts are being made to improve or alter these activities, avoiding duplication with regular campaign briefs.

3. **Comparison and Insight**: The article points out that while Marketing's projects often fit neatly into quarterly cycles, engineering work is more continuous. Therefore, OKRs in engineering should not merely restate the roadmap but should indicate new goals or changes in focus. The author suggests that when OKRs merely duplicate the roadmap, it might signal a lack of innovation or improvement in the team's approach.

In summary, OKRs should be used to highlight what's unique or changing in the current period, not to restate routine tasks or existing plans, thereby ensuring they drive strategic shifts and focus on innovation or improvement in both marketing and engineering contexts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article reflects on the author's experience transitioning from working at a large corporation like FB (presumably referring to Meta/Facebook) to smaller teams. The author highlights several points:

1. **Relief from Corporate Metrics**: The author appreciates not having to deal with Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), performance reviews, and the associated corporate politics, which they found mentally exhausting. These processes required them to constantly market themselves and their team internally.

2. **Critique of OKRs**: From a systems-thinking perspective, the author criticizes OKRs for not effectively measuring true value, especially in roles that aren't purely mechanistic. They argue that reducing human activities to metrics often distorts the actual goals, leading to unintended consequences.

3. **Perverse Incentives**: An example given is from a hypothetical suicide prevention team at FB. Here, the focus on a specific OKR like "number of suicides averted" could lead to over-flagging of content or misaligned interventions, potentially causing harm or misallocation of resources due to the pressure to meet metrics.

4. **Loss of Connection to Real Problems**: The author suggests that reliance on metrics can detach teams from the actual issues they're meant to address, turning the focus into a game of hitting numbers rather than solving real-world problems.

Overall, the article expresses a preference for working environments free from the constraints and distortions of corporate metric-driven cultures, advocating for a more nuanced understanding and approach to workplace productivity and value.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an anecdote from W. Edwards Deming's book "The Essential Deming" about a company that transports oil using barges. Initially, the operation was unprofitable. A new manager introduced a system where he tracked and displayed performance metrics on each barge without setting specific performance targets or incentives. By simply making the metrics visible to all, the barge captains began to compete informally among themselves to reduce costs and improve efficiency. This self-initiated competition led to significant savings, particularly in sourcing fuel from the cheapest available locations, which varied daily. The key takeaway is that when employees are given relevant information and autonomy, they naturally strive to perform better, demonstrating the effectiveness of transparency and empowerment over micromanagement.

## 4. [Kakizome: Japanese way of new-years resolution](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42576436)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's celebration of the Japanese New Year, highlighting the tradition of **Kakizome**, or the first calligraphy of the year, which involves writing an aspiration or theme for the year ahead. The author explains that instead of setting specific New Year's resolutions, which can be rigid and fail when life's unpredictability intervenes, one might adopt a theme or a guiding principle, akin to using a compass rather than following a set path. This year, the author chose the idiom **温故知新 (onkochishin)**, which translates to developing new ideas based on the study of the past, reflecting their personal journey of revisiting and refining their knowledge in robotics. The practice of Kakizome is not only about setting a theme but also about reflecting at the year's end on how one has lived up to this theme, which provides insights for the next year. The article encourages readers to consider their own themes for past and future years, suggesting that this reflective practice can be both fun and insightful.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the tradition of "元旦开笔" (Yuan Dan Kai Bi), which translates to "The First Writing of the New Year," a ritual practiced by ancient Chinese intellectuals on New Year's Day, dating back about 1,000 years. During the Qing Dynasty, this ceremony was expanded, particularly by the emperor, to include writing blessings with ornate brushes, symbolically turning the calendar pages (with influence from European missionaries who helped refine the Chinese calendar), and drinking from a symbolic golden cup representing the eternal borders of the empire. Interestingly, one of these golden cups was looted by French forces during the Second Opium War.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses several cultural practices in Japan related to "kakizome," which is the first calligraphy of the New Year:

1. **Elementary School Kakizome**: At the end of December, elementary students across Japan participate in writing kakizome. Each grade writes the same phrase or word, and these calligraphies are displayed in school hallways.

2. **Dondoyaki**: Around mid-January, many people participate in a festival called Dondoyaki where they burn their kakizome. This is part of a tradition to cleanse and start anew.

3. **Importance of Writing**: The process of writing kakizome is emphasized, focusing not only on the final product but also on the posture, attention, and care taken during the writing.

4. **Kanji of the Year**: Unrelated to kakizome, the article mentions that Japan's officially chosen kanji for 2024 was "金" (kin), which can mean gold, money, or even Friday, symbolizing various aspects of prosperity and value.

### Summary

 error

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an interesting practice involving U.S. currency. When the Treasury Department began issuing uncut sheets of dollar bills, some individuals would cut these sheets into irregular shapes and sell them as "miscut error" notes. In response, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) modified the serial numbers on these sheets to make them easily identifiable. For $1 bills, serial numbers starting with "99" indicate they are from uncut sheets. The author advises that if you encounter a "miscut dollar error" for sale, checking the serial number can help verify its authenticity; if it starts with "99," it's likely just a cut piece from an uncut sheet rather than a genuine printing error.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, used an unconventional method to distribute tips by purchasing sheets of $2 bills, which he had perforated and turned into pads. He would then tear off individual $2 bills to pay or tip people, often surprising them because many are not familiar with this denomination of currency.
