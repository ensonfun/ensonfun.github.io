**Total comment counts : 85**

### Summary

 Using IP geolocation to determine user language is flawed and leads to poor user experience. It fails to account for diverse linguistic landscapes and individual circumstances, often resulting in incorrect language displays. The Accept-Language header from browsers accurately indicates user preferences and should be prioritized instead of relying on unreliable geolocation data. This practice annoys users, driving some away and complicating their experience. Developers are urged to respect user preferences and avoid making assumptions based on IP location, which can be misleading and ineffective.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author criticizes multilingual websites that fail to accept the Accept-Language header and complicate language-switching by translating buttons and lists into the current language. They commend Wikipedia for its effective approach, which uses a universal icon for language switching and lists languages in their native names. The author emphasizes that assumptions about users' language preferences can lead to confusion and frustration, urging websites to emulate Wikipedia's thoughtful design.

### Top 2 Comment Summary
