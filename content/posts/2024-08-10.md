**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 This article discusses the actions taken by the ICANN Board regarding recommendations from the Competition, Consumer Trust, and Consumer Choice (CCT) Review Team. The Board initially placed 17 recommendations into pending status and committed to taking further action after completing intermediate steps. On different dates, the Board took action on some of these recommendations, including 11 in October 2020 and two in September 2023. The Organizational Effectiveness Committee considered a study commissioned by ICANN org, which examined potential impacts on competition and suggested non-pricing data elements for assessing competition in the domain name market. On July 18, 2024, the Committee recommended rejecting recommendations 2, 3, 4, and 5, an action that was subsequently approved by the Board. The Board also directed the ICANN Interim President and CEO to evaluate and supplement existing metrics with additional data elements that indicate competition and consumer welfare.

 The article discusses frustrations with the use of a private certificate authority (CA) in the ".internal" domain. It highlights the difficulties organizations face in establishing trust for the private CA on all internal systems, especially when incorporating BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) or contractor systems. 

The author suggests using a publicly valid domain, which allows for benefits such as using a free public CA like Lets Encrypt. This approach ensures that every machine will trust internal certificates without any extra effort. To automate this process, the author developed "getlocalcert," a free tool that enables the registration of a subdomain, publishing TXT records for ACME DNS certificate validation, and utilizing an internal DNS server for private use.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses whether it is better to use a top-level domain (TLD) like .internal or a regular generic TLD like .com for private-use applications. The author suggests that using a regular domain name as the root is preferable because it provides flexibility to make the name visible on the internet, even if it is entirely private and internal. Having this flexibility is advantageous for security models like zero-trust and allows for future changes without renaming the system. The author recommends using a publicly owned domain name but only publishing records for the domain on the private network, while still having the option to make them public later. The article cites Amazon's strategy for using a .com domain as the root for all services, even those only reachable from private networks, to simplify naming and certificate management. However, there are tradeoffs, such as the potential disclosure of information through the presence of names in Certificate Transparency logs.

## 4. [Building a highly-available web service without a database](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41206908)

**Total comment counts : 43**

### Summary

 The blog post discusses a new architecture for web development that challenges the traditional approach of using separate databases and web service frameworks. The author suggests using a single server with more RAM and CPU, where the web service and database instance are combined, eliminating the need for serialization of data into SQL queries. In this architecture, data is stored in memory, and in-memory indices are used for efficient data retrieval. Debugging becomes easier, and background jobs can be run as threads within the process. The article also explains how to handle process crashes by periodically taking snapshots of the data in RAM and using transaction logs to recover the state. Additionally, the new architecture allows for the storage of closures in memory, eliminating the need for object serialization across page transitions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that if your data can be stored in one server, it's best to run the database on that server without worrying too much about special architectures or reducing round-trips. If the data can fit entirely in RAM, using a ramdisk for the database and replicating it to permanent storage with standard tools is a simple solution.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article criticizes a strategy of keeping things simple by creating an in-memory database without separate instances of popular databases. The author suggests several complex steps to achieve this, including serializing transactions, writing to disk, orchestrating web servers, synchronizing transaction logs, implementing conflict resolution, sharding web servers, and implementing a load balancing layer. The author concludes that this strategy is not simple as it may seem.

## 6. [A wonderful coincidence or an expected connection: why π² ≈ g](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41208988)

**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

 This article explores the strange relationship between the mathematical constant π and the acceleration due to gravity, g. The author questions why π squared is approximately equal to g and delves into the history of the meter, which is related to π. The article explains that the 17th-century proposal for a "standard-free" definition of the meter involved using a simple pendulum, and the formula for the period of small oscillations of the pendulum includes π. However, the article notes that the equality between π squared and g is only approximate due to changes in the meter over time.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a situation where a certain value loses its significance when expressed in different units. The author argues that this pattern would typically indicate a coincidence, but in this particular case, it does not.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that if the length of a meter was defined as the length of a seconds pendulum, then the acceleration due to gravity, g, would equal exactly π². The equation for the seconds pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g), and by substituting T = 2 seconds and L = 1 meter, the article derives the equation g = π² m/s². This relationship would hold true in any strength of gravity, but it would result in different values for the length of a meter depending on the strength of gravity. The proposal was originally suggested by Talleyrand in 1790.

## 7. [Hal Hickel on Creating Tarkin for Rogue One](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41207417)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article is a blog post by Todd Vaziri, who worked on the digital human team for the creation of Grand Moff Tarkin in the film "Rogue One." The purpose of the article is to provide insight into the process of creating Tarkin and clarify any misconceptions or criticisms about his appearance in the film. Vaziri mentions that many people who saw the movie were unaware that Tarkin was a digital creation and thought he was portrayed by a regular human actor. The article includes a response from Hal Hickel, the animation supervisor for "Rogue One," who explains the process used to create Tarkin. They hired an actor, filmed them in costume, and replaced the actor's head with a CG Tarkin head. In some shots, they opted for full CG replacement of both the head and body. The actor chosen, Guy Henry, had a physical resemblance to the original actor, Peter Cushing, but the intention was not for him to do an exact impression. Henry's voice and facial expressions were recorded simultaneously during filming, and no special makeup or physical alterations were used.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's enjoyment of the movie Rogue One and praises its exploration of a previously unexplored part of the Star Wars universe. It mentions that the character of Takin may have felt a bit off due to CGI, but overall it was a good choice to include him. The author also expresses a desire for more exploration of the "mundane" aspects of Star Wars, as seen in the show Andor. The article also highlights the effectiveness of the Empire and the motivation of one of the characters to join the Rebels. Finally, it mentions a memorable exchange between characters and compares it to a discussion about ethics in Jurassic Park.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author criticizes the animation of the character Tarkin in the film Rogue One, stating that while the rendering may not have been the issue, the movement of the character felt unnatural and hand-animated rather than motion-captured. The article suggests that facial expressions were either captured or recreated by an animator, but it is unclear why the resulting movement was poor. The author also compares the portrayal of a younger Hugh Jackman in the film Logan, which they found impressive, and questions why the Tarkin model in Rogue One was not of higher quality. They mention that later depictions of Luke Skywalker and Carrie Fisher in the Mandalorian and the later Star Wars series were better in comparison.

## 9. [Caltech Develops First Noninvasive Method to Continually Measure Blood Pressure](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41207182)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 A team of researchers from Caltech has developed a noninvasive method to continuously measure blood pressure anywhere on the body. The technique, called resonance sonomanometry, uses sound waves to stimulate resonance in an artery and then uses ultrasound imaging to measure the artery's resonance frequency, providing an accurate measurement of blood pressure. The device, which is currently in prototype form, produces results comparable to those obtained with a blood pressure cuff. It has the potential to enable better vital-sign monitoring at home, in hospitals, and in remote locations with limited resources. The device is able to measure not only systolic and diastolic numbers, but the full waveform of blood pressure, providing more information about a person's blood pressure. The team hopes to first use the device in hospitals, where it would connect to existing monitors. The method has the potential to expand access to high-quality blood pressure monitoring and cardiac health metrics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author, who experienced a hypertensive crisis, is frustrated with how blood pressure is measured incorrectly in doctors' offices and hospitals.
