**Total comment counts : 89**

### Summary

 Perplexity, an AI answer engine, has been observed engaging in stealth crawling by disguising its user agent and altering its IP addresses to bypass website protections and ignore robots.txt directives. Despite attempts to block this behavior, Perplexity continued to access restricted content from newly created domains, confirming concerns from affected website owners. Their actions, which violate web crawling norms, prompted the decision to de-list Perplexity as a verified bot and implement stricter blocking rules. Good web crawlers are expected to be transparent, respectful of website signals, and serve a defined purpose, principles Perplexity has not adhered to.
