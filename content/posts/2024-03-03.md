**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

 The article discusses the company formerly known as ShotSpotter, now called SoundThinking, and their outdoor acoustic gunfire detection system. The system involves installing acoustic sensors throughout a city to detect gunfire and determine its source. The company has been criticized for its secrecy in not disclosing the locations of its sensors and for attempting to suppress research into the civil rights impacts of its product. The article also mentions a leaked spreadsheet of SoundThinking sensors and discusses the author's expedition to find and observe the sensors. It highlights concerns about the possibility of conversations being recorded by the sensors and used as evidence in criminal trials, as well as the larger issue of pervasive surveillance in urban areas. The density of SoundThinking sensors in Albuquerque, where the author conducted their expedition, is also discussed.
