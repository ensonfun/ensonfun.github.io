**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 MIT researchers have made strides in 3D printing active electronic devices without semiconductors, a development that could democratize electronics fabrication globally. During the pandemic, a shortage of semiconductor fabrication contributed to a worldwide electronics crisis. The researchers demonstrated fully 3D-printed resettable fuses, which typically require semiconductor materials. These devices, produced using standard 3D printing equipment and a biodegradable polymer doped with copper nanoparticles, can perform basic switching functions similar to semiconductor-based transistors.

The project originated from attempts to create magnetic coils with a filament showing unexpected resistance behavior under electric current—allowing it to act like a resettable fuse. Despite not yet matching the performance of silicon transistors, these devices could be utilized for basic control tasks, thus enabling smart hardware creation far from traditional manufacturing centers. The research team, led by Luis Fernando Velásquez-García and Jorge Cañada, emphasizes the potential of this technology in advancing 3D printing capabilities and its implications for electronics accessibility. Further research is needed to fully understand the unique properties of the materials used.

### Summary

 Egypt has been declared malaria-free by the World Health Organization (WHO), marking a historic achievement for the nation. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasized that malaria, which has plagued Egypt since ancient times, is now part of its history. The certification comes after nearly 100 years of efforts to combat the disease and requires proof of no transmission for at least three consecutive years. Egypt is the third country in the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region to achieve this status, following the UAE and Morocco. However, the WHO cautioned that this certification marks the beginning of a new phase, advising Egypt to maintain vigilance against the potential return of malaria. Effective prevention strategies have evolved since the 1920s, focusing on minimizing human-mosquito contact, as the disease is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 5. [Memory safety without lifetime parameters](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41899828)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The proposal discusses the creation of a memory-safe reference type in C++ that eliminates the need for lifetime annotations. Unlike the existing "Safe C++" borrow-checking model, which relies on complex lifetime parameters, this new reference type, designated as T%, simplifies the borrow-checking process while ensuring lifetime safety. 

The key aspects of the proposal include:

1. **Elimination of Lifetime Annotations**: The new safe reference type does not require lifetime arguments, as the system determines the lifetime parameters based on function types.

2. **Borrow Checking Mechanism**: This mechanism ensures exclusivity in references—there can be one mutable reference or multiple immutable references but not both simultaneously. This is crucial to maintain soundness throughout the program.

3. **Exclusivity vs. Legacy Types**: Introducing the T% reference type avoids breaking existing code that uses legacy references, which don’t constrain aliasing. By having separate safe and unsafe reference types, the proposal aims to prevent soundness issues that could arise from mutable aliasing.

4. **Examples and Implications**: The article mentions examples demonstrating the risks associated with mutable aliasing in legacy code, highlighting situations where aliasing can lead to undefined behavior. 

Overall, the proposal advocates for a distinct reference type to enhance safety and clarity in managing memory in C++, thereby avoiding the complexities introduced by lifetime parameters.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of examining an entire call tree in programming, suggesting that this approach could reduce the need for extensive annotations while potentially leading to longer compile times. It raises several concerns, including how to manage circular references and the built-in circularity from parent-child relationships in C++ objects. The author wonders about handling interior mutability and mentions the benefits of analyzing the call tree, such as detecting mutex deadlocks. It suggests the possibility of creating an alternative to Rust's RefCell, potentially named "SafeCell," which would perform compile-time checks for overlapping borrow scopes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a proposal that establishes two types of constraint rules for return references in programming. Free functions will limit return references based on the shortest lifetime of their arguments, while non-static member functions will base their constraints on the lifetime of the implicit object. However, the author criticizes this approach as overly restrictive, suggesting that it would prevent practical use cases, such as a regex object returning a reference to a string passed to its match method.

## 8. [Scientists working to decode birdsong](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41900404)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 In a tranquil setting in Grünau im Almtal, Austria, greylag geese engage in social behaviors that highlight their complex communication. Among them, a goose named Edes responds to recorded calls of his life partner, Bon Jovi, showcasing the nuances within their vocalizations. The research at the Konrad Lorenz Research Center reveals that greylag geese have at least ten different types of calls, indicating sophisticated social structures and interactions. 

Director Sonia Kleindorfer highlights the underappreciation of goose communication, noting their ability to convey information through various calls. Bird vocalizations, however, do not neatly align with human terms, as birds utilize a syrinx that allows for more versatile sounds than the human larynx. 

Kleindorfer's research extends beyond geese; she has explored vocalizations in other bird species, challenging traditional views that downplayed female songbirds. Her findings have revealed that females also produce complex songs, furthering our understanding of avian communication. Kleindorfer's career has focused on various aspects of bird behavior, including vocalizations and developmental responses in chicks, contributing valuable insights to the field of ornithology.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential for translating animal languages, expressing surprise at the lack of projects like "Dr. Doolittle." It highlights rats and corvids as fitting candidates for such efforts due to their manageable size and observable behavior. The author mentions a research paper claiming to have decoded Sperm whale language and checks out the CETI project, noting the complexity of obtaining good whale recordings due to environmental challenges. Unlike whales, which communicate over long distances and likely don't use body language, the author believes that in time, humans will teach animals basic concepts like self-awareness, which might affect public attitudes towards eating meat, even from animals traditionally considered less intelligent, such as chickens.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 9. [Making Castro’s Feeds Update Faster the Lazy Way](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41900645)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses improvements being made to the Castro podcast app, particularly its backend performance. Castro has recently achieved new user highs, partially due to a new pumpkin icon. The backend consists of two main components: endpoints for the app and workers that update podcast feeds. Most of the workers' time (about 99%) is spent checking and updating these feeds, but their execution time has increased from around 1 second to approximately 1.3–1.4 seconds. 

The author, familiar with performance optimizations, notices that improvements can likely come from a small portion of the code. Utilizing a Ruby profiling tool called rbspy, they analyze the backend performance and identify that a significant portion of the workers’ time comes from setting up trust stores for network requests, which is inefficient when repeated millions of times daily. This insight highlights an unexpected source of performance issues, suggesting that reusing components in the network stack could enhance efficiency without major changes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses satisfaction with Castro's active development approach, highlighting that the company is demonstrating their progress rather than just communicating it. The mention of a Halloween app icon is cited as an example of this ongoing development.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their experience implementing WebPubSub support for podcast feeds at their podcast hosting job, which allowed for "push" updates instead of relying on an indexer to frequently check the XML file. Despite this innovation, the feature did not gain widespread acceptance, with Google being the only indexer at the time to support it. The author expresses uncertainty about whether this support has continued following Google's shift towards YouTube for podcasts.

## 10. [An amateur historian has discovered a long-lost short story by Bram Stoker](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41905664)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 An amateur historian, Brian Cleary, has discovered a previously unknown short story by Bram Stoker, titled "Gibbet Hill," published in 1890 just before Stoker began writing his famous novel "Dracula." Cleary found the 134-year-old story in the archives of the National Library of Ireland while dealing with sudden hearing loss during a break from work. Stoker biographer Paul Murray notes that the story is important for understanding Stoker’s development as a writer and provides insight into themes of good and evil that are prevalent in his later works. 

"Gibbet Hill" narrates the tale of a sailor killed by criminals, whose bodies are displayed on gallows as a warning. The story will be published alongside artwork by Paul McKinley, with proceeds going to the Charlotte Stoker Fund, which aims to fund research on infant hearing loss. The discovery will also be celebrated during the Bram Stoker festival in Dublin later this month.
