## 8. [Intent to end OCSP service](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41046956)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 Let's Encrypt, the nonprofit certificate authority, has announced its plan to end support for the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) in favor of using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). While both OCSP and CRLs are methods for communicating certificate revocation information, Let's Encrypt believes that CRLs have significant advantages over OCSP, particularly in terms of privacy. OCSP allows Certificate Authorities (CAs) to become aware of the specific websites being visited from visitors' IP addresses, which poses privacy risks. Let's Encrypt also wants to simplify its CA infrastructure and allocate resources more efficiently, as supporting OCSP services consumes considerable resources. The CA/Browser Forum has made providing OCSP services optional for publicly trusted CAs, and once Microsoft Root Program follows suit, Let's Encrypt plans to announce a detailed timeline for shutting down its OCSP services. It is recommended that users relying on OCSP services start transitioning away from that dependence as soon as possible.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article expresses concern about the practice of some certificate authorities (CAs) returning an OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) response of "unknown or unauthorized" for certificates found in CT (Certificate Transparency) logs. This suggests that the CAs may have forgotten that they issued these certificates. The author finds this troubling and suggests that the requirement to include an OCSP URL in certificates should be removed, but that OCSP URLs for every issuer should be disclosed in the CCADB (Certificate Authority Browser & Deployment) to address privacy concerns. This would make OCSP responders more cost-effective while maintaining transparency into the status of certificates. The author also mentions that OCSP Watch is currently reporting several forgotten NETLOCK certificates.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests adding the Must Staple restriction to all certificates unconditionally. It states that this will address privacy concerns and still allow for support from non-browser applications.

## 9. [Give Me the Green Light Part 1: Hacking Traffic Control Systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40995344)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 This article discusses the author's investigation into traffic controllers and their vulnerabilities. The author describes their attempt at responsible disclosure and shares their experience in finding vulnerabilities in traffic controllers. They also discuss the importance and role of traffic signal controllers in managing road traffic. The author then explains how they discovered a vulnerability in a specific traffic controller's web interface, where no authentication was configured, allowing them to access and make changes to the controller without needing to log in. The article concludes by mentioning that further details and attacks will be discussed in future blog posts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of traffic signal controller security. It mentions that the reality is worse than what is described in the article, as most signal controllers support both "standard" and "proprietary" Management Information Bases (MIBs). These MIBs allow users to control various settings like flash lights, timing settings, and green light preemptions. Additionally, the standard suggests using a default SNMP community name of "public," which means that someone can easily change settings on any traffic controller without needing to exploit anything. The author, who works in the industry, expresses concern about the poor security of this infrastructure and the slow progress in addressing such issues.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that in order to prioritize cybersecurity, legal immunity should be granted for unsolicited responsible disclosure. It argues that individuals should not face legal repercussions when attempting to assist and highlight vulnerabilities, rather than being punished under the CFAA.

## 10. [Shape of Motion: 4D Reconstruction from a Single Video](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41018635)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses a method called Shape of Motion that can reconstruct a four-dimensional (4D) scene from a single monocular video. This is a difficult problem because it is highly ill-posed. Previous approaches have limitations such as depending on templates, only working for quasi-static scenes, or not explicitly modeling 3D motion. The Shape of Motion method overcomes these challenges by representing scene motion with a compact set of SE(3) motion bases and utilizing data-driven priors. These priors include monocular depth maps and long-range 2D tracks, which are effectively consolidated to create a globally consistent representation of the dynamic scene. The experiments show that the Shape of Motion method achieves state-of-the-art performance for motion estimation and novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes. However, fast motion and occlusions can still be challenging for this method, and it relies on off-the-shelf methods that may not always be accurate.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of adjusting IPD (interpupillary distance) for individuals in 3D virtual reality videos, as opposed to using a static IPD from the camera setup. It suggests that allowing slight head movement would enhance the immersive experience. Additionally, if the video is already filmed with a static stereo setup, it would be easier to create an accurate 4D video with limited travel distances and minimal errors.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how future generations may find the movie "Blade Runner" strange, not because of the zoom into the picture, but because the main character believes in hallucinated data.
