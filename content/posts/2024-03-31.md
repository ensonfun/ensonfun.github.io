### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an optimal strategy for solving a problem where you cannot see the color but only the answers when you click submit. The current strategy, called hillclimbing, suggests moving to the right until the score drops, and then moving one to the left. This strategy results in around 9 tries per slider and 27 tries per color on average. The article proposes using the difference in score between 0 to 1 as a signal to improve the strategy, indicating the approximate length to move to the right. However, due to rounding, the exact length is not obtained. With an optimal strategy, it is estimated that an average of 4 tries per slider and 12 tries per color would be needed.

 The article highlights how focusing on percentage changes rather than colors can make it easier to guess in a game of Guess My OKLCH. This unintentionally serves as an advertisement for perceptual color spaces.

## 2. [Xz: A microcosm of the interactions in open source projects](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39879710)

**Total comment counts : 38**

### Summary

 This article discusses a vulnerability in the xz/liblzma software and focuses on the initial interactions between the maintainer and the community. The maintainer acknowledges that he is struggling and needs help, but instead receives unhelpful comments from consumers. The maintainer defends himself, citing mental health issues and the fact that the project is an unpaid hobby. The article highlights the lack of support and understanding from the community and concludes with the suggestion of finding a co-maintainer or passing the projects to someone else.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article questions whether developers waste mental energy by trying to be accommodating and understanding towards users and commenters. The author specifically discusses their experience working on side projects such as emulators and game remakes without involving donations or money distribution within the project to avoid complications. They express that the progress of such projects is often limited by the lack of skilled contributors rather than overall interest. The author believes that while it is natural to allow and encourage discussion around a project, some individuals make excessive suggestions or demands, which can negatively impact volunteers' motivation. The author acknowledges that most of these comments come from good intentions but find them draining and demotivating. They express a desire to enjoy coding game remakes rather than dealing with drama in community discussions. However, the author reflects on the expectation of having an open community for all projects and recognizes the potential perception of wanting a closed community of agreement-seeking individuals. They question whether allowing this type of open community is actually beneficial in the long run.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author initially thought it was paranoid to suggest that people on a linked thread might be involved in an attack. However, they came across a message that indicated a possible connection, mentioning ignored patches and the need for a change in maintainer. The author sees this as evidence of a sophisticated and patient supply chain psyops attack.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the filming location of a forest scene in the 2022 movie. Contrary to popular belief, the scene was not filmed in Muir Woods, Marin County. Instead, it was shot in Del Norte County and Humboldt County in California. The filmmakers initially wanted to film in Muir Woods but were rejected due to safety concerns. After the filming, the Del Norte forest was clear-cut, but the area where the speeder chase scene was shot remains preserved within a state park in Humboldt County. The Film Commission has included this location in its "Map of the Movies" for a self-guided tour in the two counties.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concerns regarding Sudden Oak Death syndrome, which is a disease that affects various tree species, including the Coast Redwood. This syndrome, caused by an oomycete similar to the one responsible for the potato famine, is spreading in California and has also been detected in some eastern US states and the UK, causing damage to larch trees.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a feature called RAG (Retrieve and Generate) that can be applied to a character's chat history. The feature is similar to an extension called SillyTavern, but it is suggested that integrating RAG into the existing project that uses Llamaindex would be more convenient.

## 8. [Mathematician who made sense of the universe's randomness wins Abel Prize](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39879496)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Michel Talagrand has been awarded the 2024 Abel Prize for his work on stochastic systems and randomness. His research focuses on modeling and predicting random variables in various systems, such as stock prices, river heights, and bacterial populations. Talagrand's mathematical formulas known as inequalities help characterize the limits of variability in these systems, offering precise estimates and practical applications in fields like physics, chemistry, and ecology. He also provided a proof for a physics problem that was thought to be unsolvable using pure mathematics. Talagrand's personal journey includes overcoming personal struggles and blindness, which shaped his approach to mathematics. The Abel Prize, considered the Nobel Prize of mathematics, comes with a cash prize of $700,000.

Talagrand emphasizes the importance of understanding the simple concepts in detail, regardless of one's intelligence or ability. The article suggests that applying this philosophy can lead to success in various areas of life.

## 9. [Models all the way down](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39877960)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of a large AI training set called LAION-5B, which contains images and text captions harvested from the internet. Researchers from Stanford's Internet Observatory found over 3,000 images categorized as Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) in this training set. LAION-5B is a foundation dataset for generative artificial intelligence models, but its creators explicitly warned against using it for real-world applications. However, it is likely that many commercial models have been trained on this set, including chat bots and image generators. The scale of LAION-5B makes human curation impossible, leading to the presence of CSAM images. Investigating training sets is essential to understanding biases and potential risks in AI models. LAION-5B was built from a larger dataset called Common Crawl, which contains web data from over 3 billion websites. Certain domains such as Pinterest, Shopify, and SlidePlayer are well-represented in LAION-5B due to the abundance of images and the way content is served on these sites. LAION-5B was created by processing Common Crawl and extracting images with ALT attributes, which are intended to improve accessibility.
