 Before undergoing a CAC scan, consider testing for ApoB, Lp(a), hs-CRP, HbA1c, and eGFR. These tests can identify hidden heart disease risks, as many individuals with normal cholesterol may still have abnormal ApoB levels, and Lp(a) is a significant hereditary factor. Inflammation (hs-CRP) and insulin resistance (HbA1c) also raise risk levels, while eGFR assesses kidney function relevant to heart disease models. Notably, most of these risk factors can be modified through lifestyle changes and medication. CAC scans detect calcified plaque, but the mentioned tests help identify earlier signs of soft plaque buildup.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a powerful tool that goes beyond basic partitioning, offering features like RAID, device migration, integrity checking, caching, writable snapshots, and thin provisioning. Instead of layering RAID on top of LVM, it's more effective to utilize LVM's flexibility directly within a single volume group (VG). Individual logical volumes (LVs) can have different RAID levels. However, caution is advised with thin provisioning due to potential performance issues and faults. Overall, LVM enhances storage management significantly compared to traditional methods.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author discusses caching access patterns, highlighting ext4 journals' efficiency due to their small size and high IOPS. For improved performance, they've successfully used external journals on SSDs with slow SMR disks.
