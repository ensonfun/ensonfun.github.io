### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article tells a story about a nurse at a hospital who called tech support because she had a "weather report" window on her screen that she couldn't close because it would go under the screen. When the tech support person arrived, they realized that the nurse had accidentally pressed a button on the monitor that called up the brightness menu, making it appear as if there was a window on the screen. The issue was resolved by pressing the button again, and the tech support person went back to wait for the next call.

 In 1989, the author worked as the sole IT department for a group of ex-academic economists who were using a Digital VAX 11/750 computer for econometric modeling. The computer operated on a multi-user operating system called VMS, with all users having admin rights. Each user believed that increasing their model's process priority would make it run faster. However, this actually disrupted the real-time processes necessary for the computer's effective functioning. The author revoked their privileges and after a system restart, the computer returned to normal operation. The author was appreciated for resolving the issue and making the system work faster.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a significant and permanent decline in website traffic over a few days in May 2022. The number of daily new visits decreased from approximately 1 million to 300,000, daily page views dropped from around 20 million to 14 million, and daily sessions decreased from about 9.4 million to 6.1 million. However, during the same period, there was no corresponding decrease in posts/votes. They remained relatively constant until February 2023 when both experienced a significant decline, potentially due to the rise of LLMs (Large Language Models). The traffic data is sourced from Google Analytics, while post/vote data is computed internally by StackOverflow. The author speculates whether the sudden drop in traffic in May 2022 is an artifact of Google Analytics changing how it tracks traffic/visitors.

They realized that by going through the process of writing a high-quality question with a clear thought process and providing examples of their attempts at solving it, they often found the solution without needing to actually post the question on SO.

## 4. [Google’s nightmare “Web Integrity API” wants a DRM gatekeeper for the web](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36854114)

**Total comment counts : 67**

### Summary

 Google is proposing a new web standard called the "Web Environment Integrity API" that aims to verify the integrity of web browsers and users. The goal is to ensure that users are not robots and that browsers have not been tampered with. This data would be useful for advertisers, social media platforms, game developers, and financial institutions. Google's plan involves a web server requiring users to pass an "environment attestation" test, which involves contacting a third-party attestation server and receiving an "IntegrityToken" if the test is passed. This token would then unlock the desired content. The proposed API is similar to existing attestation signals used by Apple and Android.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that Google's market dominance in areas such as web browsing, advertising, search engine, operating systems, and popular websites gives it the power to do what it wants, regardless of how it affects users. The author argues that this is where the idea of breaking up the company becomes relevant, as Google's immense market power may result in negative consequences that users cannot address.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes a project aimed at collecting user data to improve advertising, counter online bots, protect intellectual property, and prevent cheating in online games. The author expresses displeasure with Google's attempt to gather personal information, arguing that web browsers are meant to serve users, not gather information about them.

## 7. [RNA editing is common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods (2017)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36855236)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that allows for the diversification of proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint. Recent reports suggest that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, such as squids. This editing is enriched in the nervous system and affects molecules related to excitability and neuronal morphology. The process of RNA editing is important for diversifying proteins, particularly those associated with neural function. The large number of editing sites in cephalopods reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms in protein-coding regions, highlighting the trade-off between genome evolution and transcriptome plasticity. Overall, this study suggests that RNA editing plays a significant role in proteome diversity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that allows for the diversification of proteomes in animals. However, it is not frequently used for this purpose. RNA splicing, on the other hand, is a widely used and highly important RNA editing process in eukaryotes. It is so common and conserved that even if a human gene is inserted into a mouse, it would be spliced in the same way. Therefore, RNA editing is not as rare as some might think.

## 8. [Mozilla Standards Positions Opposes Web Integrity API](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36857032)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article discusses a proposal called the "Integrity API" that is currently being relied upon by Chromium's prototype. The author expresses concerns about the lack of vendor-neutrality and the potential for the API to restrict users of other browsers. Mozilla also opposes the proposal, stating that it contradicts their principles and vision for the Web. They argue that mechanisms that restrict user choices are harmful to the openness of the Web ecosystem. Additionally, the proposal's use cases may obstruct existing uses of the Web, such as assistive technologies and automatic testing. Mozilla suggests that the proposal lacks practical progress and has clear downsides. Despite disagreements in the past, the author is grateful for Mozilla's objection to the proposal and donates to the organization.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains how a particular attack works. The attacker creates a device, such as a smartphone, and generates a keypair for it. The device runs the attacker's software and whenever non-attacker software is run with elevated privileges, the device informs the hardware security module (HSM) in a way that cannot be reset. The HSM produces signatures that indicate the device is running the attacker's software. This allows conniving third parties to ensure they are interacting with a device that is under the attacker's control, restricting user behavior as specified by the attacker. The attack is already happening on Android and iOS smartphones and has now been extended to the web.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is urging people to use Firefox as an alternative to Google Chrome. They argue that if everyone uses Chrome, there will be no one left to challenge Google's control over it. Having a competing browser with a significant market share is seen as necessary to prevent Google from doing whatever it wants without any opposition. The author acknowledges that Firefox is not perfect, but believes it is important to have a viable alternative.
