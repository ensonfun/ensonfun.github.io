## 1. [2002: Last.fm and Audioscrobbler Herald the Social Web](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46266875)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 Two early pioneers, Last.fm and Audioscrobbler, independently built music discovery around collaborative filtering before the Web 2.0 era. Last.fm, founded in 2002 by four Austrian/German students in London, let users build listening profiles and share them via a “Map of Music,” using collaborative filtering to recommend songs akin to Amazon’s item-to-item approach. Audioscrobbler, started the same year by Richard Jones at the University of Southampton, coined “audioscrobbler” (scrobbling) to track listening and generate recommendations. Both aimed to create a social listening network; they would soon merge.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Discussion centers on people continuing to scrobble music across Last.fm and open-source or self-hosted alternatives (ListenBrainz, Koito) while sharing data with friends.
- Concern: Potential worries include juggling multiple platforms, privacy and data hosting considerations, and possible fragmentation of scrobbling histories.
- Perspectives: Some users favor open-source/self-hosted solutions for greater data control, while others remain loyal to Last.fm and their long-term scrobbling history.
- Overall sentiment: Positive

## 2. [Hashcards: A plain-text spaced repetition system](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264492)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 Hashcards is a local-first spaced repetition app using FSRS, but it stores flashcards as a directory of Markdown files, not in a database. Cards are content-addressed by a hash of their text, and performance/history is stored in an SQLite database in the same directory. A web interface at localhost:8000 lets you review. The collection can be edited in any editor, versioned in Git, and shared on GitHub; you can generate cards from structured data and manipulate them with Unix tools. It aims for ownership and portability, addressing Anki/Mochi frustrations with friction and openness.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Spaced repetition is powerful for behavior modification beyond flashcards, as illustrated by a personal story, and the discussion weighs how different SRS tools (notably Anki) and new approaches handle features and workflows.
- Concern: There is tension around practical adoption and interoperability, including quality of shared decks, data portability, and the trade-offs between offline vs. web-first experiences.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints vary from strong support for Anki’s flexibility and ecosystem to optimism for new markdown/AI-driven SRS projects and collaboration-focused approaches, tempered by concerns about onboarding and deck quality.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 3. [Ask HN: What Are You Working On? (December 2025)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264491)

**Total comment counts : 184**

### Summary

 This post bundles several tech updates. One project, still in early alpha, aims to a secrets store and keyboard-driven scripts for chat ops. A personal note: moving fully to USB-C and a “dumb” home with physical switches and wall panels. A blaster simulator (blastersim) core is finished; it’s object‑oriented and modular, letting different control volumes/configurations be built, with GUI/docs to come. Anki-like app contrasts: learns from user-imported videos/websites/ebooks and optimizes for vocabulary with audio, images, examples, and definitions. Also, a free, offline speech‑to‑text app built on Whisper (macOS/Windows/Linux/iOS), with cross‑platform support thanks to Whisper projects; feedback welcome.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A wide array of people share progress updates on personal projects and lifestyle experiments, from digital minimalism and smart-home simplification to open-source software, games, and education apps.
- Concern: The main worry across updates is potential project overreach, with technical hurdles, scope creep, and time constraints threatening timely results.
- Perspectives: There are diverse viewpoints, from pursuing hardware-free, offline, privacy-friendly setups to aggressively prototyping indie tools and platforms for developers, creatives, or learners.
- Overall sentiment: Upbeat and pragmatic.

## 5. [Do dyslexia fonts work? (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46266094)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 Specialized dyslexia fonts and related visual aids have surged in popularity, but experts say they rely on the myth that dyslexia is a visual disorder. Originating from Samuel Orton’s idea of directional confusion, dyslexia is now viewed as a language-based processing difference. Studies of OpenDyslexic and Dyslexie show no reading-ability gains and often a preference for standard fonts, with some users reading more slowly. Experts warn these fonts can give false hope and distract from evidence-based phonological interventions.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether dyslexia-friendly fonts help reading, noting that dyslexia exists on a spectrum and fonts do not reliably improve reading in controlled studies, whereas phonics remains the proven method.
- Concern: The main worry is that promoting fonts as a cure could mislead parents and educators and delay adoption of evidence-based interventions.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from personal anecdotes of font-based reading ease to skeptical, science-based critiques that benefits are inconsistent and that phonics is essential.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [JSDoc is TypeScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46266102)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article argues against the TypeScript vs. JSDoc dichotomy, asserting that JSDoc is effectively TypeScript because the TypeScript language service provides IntelliSense and type-checking for JS projects annotated with JSDoc, even without .ts files or a separate build step. It references a 2023 Svelte incident and Rich Harris’s defense but emphasizes that Svelte’s commitment to TS remains strong. The author shares a personal experience rewriting a project with JSDoc typings to show that JSDoc offers the same static analysis as TS, just without a build step.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread argues about the merits and drawbacks of TypeScript, Flow, and JSDoc for typing in JavaScript, including tooling, language features, and build-step implications.
- Concern: The main worry is that choosing a typing approach can hinder tooling accuracy, control over exports, and project complexity, potentially impacting productivity and runtime safety.
- Perspectives: Views differ between TypeScript advocates who applaud strong typing and ecosystem maturity and JSDoc/Flow supporters who prefer lighter-weight typing without a separate language or heavy build steps, plus considerations of developer literacy and professional maturity.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 7. [Developing a food-safe finish for my wooden spoons](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46224303)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 Choosing a wood finish for hand-carved spoons and cups is a trade-off among cure time, safety, odor, and appearance. Pure tung oil becomes a food-safe polymer but cures in 2–4 weeks and looks matte. Polymerized tung oil cures faster but is rare and may need citrus thinning. Linseed oils yellow, cure slowly, or taste oily; stand oil helps but still flavors. Osmo Polyx Oil cures quickly but smells of solvents. Rubio Monocoat hardwax oils cure fast but are hard to mix on small pieces. Blending drying oils with wax is promising; epoxy and edible oils have drawbacks.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread discusses finishing wooden utensils and other food-contact wooden items, weighing safety, durability, practicality, and environmental implications of different finishes.
- Concern: The main worry is whether any finish is truly food-safe and durable enough, while avoiding toxin exposure, allergen reactions (urushiol), or leaching into food or hot liquids.
- Perspectives: Views range from advocating no finish or simple food-safe oils for maximum safety and tactile quality, to using waxes, tung oil, or varnishes for durability, to considering urushi lacquer despite allergy risks, and to weighing environmental impact and practicality.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [In the Beginning was the Command Line (1999)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46189905)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 error

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion questions the origin and accuracy of the OS-history analogy (Windows as a station wagon, Mac as a luxury sedan, Linux as a free tank) and challenges the idea of a visionary Gates/Allen role, suggesting Windows built on earlier work.  
- Concern: There is worry that the history is misrepresented and the analogy is outdated, potentially spreading a misleading narrative about OS development.  
- Perspectives: Some participants appreciate the historical/philosophical discussion of operating systems and the analogy, while others dispute the claim of a Gates/Allen vision, asserting they merely resold an existing OS.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 9. [AI and the ironies of automation – Part 2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46262816)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 Building on Bainbridge’s The Ironies of Automation, the article argues AI-based white-collar automation still needs strong human-in-the-loop safeguards. Unlike high-stakes industrial control, AI work involves quick, stressful decisions with potentially severe consequences if the AI errs. Bainbridge’s key recommendation: in rare but fast-signaling situations, provide artificial assistance (alarm-on-alarm) to aid detection and reduce fatigue. In AI-agent setups, humans supervise fleets (general or specialized), reviewing and approving agent plans to prevent missteps.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread applies Bainbridge's 1983 automation insights to AI agents, focusing on ironies like skill decay, the need for constant expert training, and humans managing increasingly autonomous systems.
- Concern: The main worry is that automation introduces new complexity and hidden failures that erode human expertise and undermine effective oversight.
- Perspectives: Views range from caution about ongoing training needs, observability gaps, and management challenges to skepticism that industry tooling has matured, with real-world examples from aviation and current AI shortcomings.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 10. [Shai-Hulud compromised a dev machine and raided GitHub org access: a post-mortem](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46262021)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 Trigger.dev describes a November 24–25, 2025 incident where the Shai-Hulud 2.0 npm supply-chain worm compromised hundreds of packages and thousands of repositories across the JavaScript ecosystem, affecting PostHog, Zapier, AsyncAPI, Postman, and ENS. Trigger.dev’s own packages stayed safe; the breach came from an engineer’s compromised machine that allowed 17 hours of unauthorized GitHub access and credential theft. The attacker cloned 669 repos, created credential storage repos, and automated destructive PR closures in seconds, with malicious commits attributed to 'Linus Torvalds.' The incident prompted security changes to prevent future intrusions.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on security risks in package ecosystems, particularly that package managers can run arbitrary code via dependencies and post-install scripts, enabling silent credential theft and supply‑chain attacks.
- Concern: The main worry is that attackers can silently compromise development environments through third-party packages, exfiltrate credentials, and gain access to sensitive systems even when the initial infection looks ordinary.
- Perspectives: Opinions span defending npm/package ecosystems and blaming them for lack of oversight, calling for stronger controls (EDR, egress filtering, restricted lifecycle scripts), and emphasizing the importance of transparent post-mortems and secure dev practices.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
