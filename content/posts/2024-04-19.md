### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article explains the history of the Seamonkey browser, which was originally known as "Mozilla" or "Mozilla Application Suite." Seamonkey was the original browser developed by Mozilla, but the code was later spun off into the Phoenix and Thunderbird projects. Originally, Mozilla was intended for developers while consumers were expected to use Netscape. However, when AOL laid off Netscape developers in 2003, the focus shifted to Phoenix, later called Firebird, which eventually became known as Firefox in 2004. As Firefox gained popularity over the Mozilla Application Suite, Seamonkey was created as a separate project using the original browser's codename. While Seamonkey has not kept up with Firefox's modern rendering engine, it remains an interesting historical browser with a user interface that has remained largely unchanged since the 2000s.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article has a problem with the inclusion of "import std;" as the first line of code in a beginner's C++ programming book. They argue that this statement is not supported by most compilers, including MSVC. The author attempted to use "g++ --std=c++23 -fmodules-ts" on a Debian machine, but it did not work. They also mention that according to the documentation, this feature is partially supported by clang++ 17 but encountered an error with "module 'std' not found." The author finds it problematic that a beginner's book includes a feature that is not widely supported and questions how a beginner would react to it. They mention facing the same issue while reading "Tour of C++" a year or two ago.
