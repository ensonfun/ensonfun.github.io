## 7. [Farms that create habitat key to food security and biodiversity](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37386661)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 This article discusses a study conducted by Stanford researchers in Costa Rica on the impact of diversified farming on bird populations. The researchers found that smaller farms with varying crops and patches of forest habitat sustained many forest-dependent bird species, while bird populations declined in forests and intensive agriculture areas. The study highlights the importance of maintaining tree cover in farming areas to provide essential habitats for wildlife. The researchers suggest that diversified farming is crucial for biodiversity and food security, as different bird species play a role in pest control and pollination. The findings also challenge the assumption that farmland cannot support significant biodiversity. The article mentions that Costa Rica has successfully reversed deforestation through a payment for ecosystem services program, and the government is now working on a new program to encourage farmers to adopt best management practices.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that our heavily subsidized and centralized food production system in the US, and likely in other Western countries as well, makes it difficult for those focused on biodiversity, sustainability, or animal welfare to compete economically. The solution proposed is a more localized food system, as large-scale ranching and farming rely heavily on monoculture and government subsidies. The author uses the example of raising a small herd of grass-fed cattle without the use of pesticides, herbicides, or antibiotics. They explain that it is not economically viable to sell meat or dairy at prices comparable to grocery stores, and scaling up production would not solve the financial challenge due to the additional inputs required. The article suggests that using fertilizers, antibiotics, and pesticides in industrial cattle production is a temporary solution that poses risks and increases workload and stress.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author has recently joined a farming co-op in the Netherlands that focuses on sustainable food production and increasing biodiversity. The co-op leases about 30 hectares of land that was previously used for growing corn to feed cows. The author enjoys helping with weeding. There are about 18 similar farming co-ops in the country.
