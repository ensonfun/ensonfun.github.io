**Total comment counts : 92**

### Summary

 Thousands of AT&T users experienced a cellular outage in the United States, disrupting calls, text messages, and emergency services. The outage affected major cities, including San Francisco. AT&T restored service to all affected customers by 3 p.m. ET. The cause of the outage is unknown, and the company did not disclose the number of affected customers. The FCC is investigating the incident. Shares of AT&T closed 2.41% lower on the day. The outage prevented users from reaching emergency services by dialing 911, and some users saw zero service bars or the letters SOS on their phones. AT&T customers were still able to make calls using Wi-Fi calling. Other carriers, such as Verizon and T-Mobile, reported a few thousand outages each.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential cascading effects of a recent internet outage, specifically focusing on its impact on drivers. While people in buildings were able to fallback to wifi, drivers could face significant challenges. Some of the potential consequences mentioned include delayed packages for drivers relying on mapping apps for deliveries, ride-share drivers unable to get directions to pickups or drop-offs, and worsened traffic due to drivers being unable to optimize their routes. The article also raises questions about whether larger companies have their own infrastructure or redundancy in place to mitigate these issues. Additionally, it mentions the higher risk of not receiving timely emergency treatment due to the inability to make calls during the outage.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights a major architectural flaw in the Bell System's electromechanical switching. It mentions that throughout its history, no central office was ever out of service for more than 30 minutes except for natural disasters or one major fire in NYC. The AT&T Long Lines system had ten independent and interconnected regional centers in the 1960s and 1970s. Although there was a control center in Bedminster, NJ, it only monitored and sent routing updates every 15 minutes. In case of heavy load, switches could revert to default routing, resulting in some calls not getting through. However, most calls still functioned properly.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The Hungarian word for trash cans, "kuka", originated from the names of German industrialists Johann Josef Keller and Jakob Knappich. They founded a factory in Augsburg, Bavaria called Keller und Knappich Augsburg (KUKA), which expanded into manufacturing various products, including hoppers for Hungarian garbage trucks. The trucks were colloquially referred to as "kukás auto" or "car with KUKA written on it", leading to the term "kuka" being used for trash cans. It is worth noting that the Hungarian word "kuka" already existed, but with a different meaning unrelated to garbage.

The article also mentions that the term "aberration" is not named after Ernst Abbe, an optics scientist, but derives from a Latin root.

## 5. [Google to pause Gemini image generation of people after issues](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39465250)

**Total comment counts : 120**

### Summary

 Google has issued an apology for the "inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions" created by its Gemini AI tool. The tool, which generates images, has come under fire for depicting white figures and historical groups as people of color, potentially as an overcorrection to address racial bias issues in AI. Social media posts have criticized the tool for failing to produce historically accurate results. Google acknowledged the errors and stated that they are working to improve these depictions. The controversy has largely been promoted by right-wing figures, who accuse Google of a conspiracy to avoid depicting white people. Gemini's attempt to boost diversity may be due to the chronic lack of diversity in generative AI. The tool is refusing some image generation tasks, but some historical requests still result in factual misrepresentations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author is expressing their desire for Google to face repercussions for its actions. They claim that Google has been financially supported without consequence despite its failing projects. The author also suggests that Google is resistant to feedback, as its billions of users are not seen as customers.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights concerns about institutional rot within Google, where prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has overshadowed a focus on quality results. The author suggests that investors should question whether this shift in focus indicates a company on the rise or decline. If Google's technology emphasizes identity over reality, it may eventually be overtaken by competitors.

## 10. [My Favorite Statistical Measure: Hoeffding's D](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39447125)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the importance of feedback and states that all feedback is taken seriously. It also mentions a statistical measure called Hoeffding's D and provides a detailed introduction to it.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the misconceptions surrounding Hoeffding's D, which is a statistic used in nonparametric tests for independence. It clarifies that Hoeffding's D is not intended to measure the strength or direction of a relationship between variables. The scale of Hoeffding's D is mostly meaningless, except that values close to 0 indicate independence and values close to 1 indicate some kind of strong relationship. The article also explains that Hoeffding's D is blind to certain deviations from independence and can be 0 even with clear dependence. The author suggests using the distance correlation for measuring the strength of the relationship between variables instead.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the need to compare two sequences of numbers in order to measure their level of correlation or dependency. Although the article provides 20 additional sentences explaining why one might have two sequences of numbers and what they could look like, the reader suggests that the first sentence is sufficient for anyone interested in the topic.
