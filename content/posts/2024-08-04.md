### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests a method called "Feynman's Trick" for finding the sum of a certain function. The function is represented by a summation and has the form f(x) = Sum_{n=1}^\infty c^(-xn). By differentiating this function multiple times, and applying some calculations, the article explains how the sum can be related to the kth derivative of the function. The function can be evaluated explicitly since it is a geometric series, and by calculating the derivatives and evaluating at a specific value, the desired sum can be found. Although the process is labor intensive, it is considered less mysterious than other approaches.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how generating functions can be used to derive a sequence of operations. It explains that starting with the generating function G(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + ..., which can be expressed as 1/(1-x), the coefficients of this polynomial represent the sequence (0^0, 1^0, 2^0, ...). Taking the derivative of G(x) and multiplying by x, the resulting polynomial has coefficients that represent the sequence (0^1, 1^1, 2^1, ...). This process can be repeated to obtain polynomials with coefficients representing (0^2, 1^2, 2^2, ...) and so on, with N iterations resulting in a polynomial with coefficients (0^N, 1^N, 2^N, ...). The infinite sum converges for -1 < x < 1, and by setting x=1/c, where c is a constant, the infinite sum can be solved. Therefore, any infinite sum of this form can be solved by taking the derivative of 1/(1-x) N times while multiplying by x each time, and then plugging in x=1/c at the end.

## 8. [Techniques used by developers to bypass App Store review](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41146779)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses how pirate streaming apps for iOS are able to trick the App Store review process and get approved. These apps use techniques such as geofencing and shared code bases to hide their true capabilities. They are built on React Native and use Microsoft's CodePush SDK, which allows developers to update parts of the app without submitting a new build. The apps also use specific APIs to check the device's location based on the IP address. During the review process, the hidden features of the app are not revealed, but after approval, developers use CodePush to update the app with additional functionalities. The article suggests that Apple should implement additional tests and be more proactive in removing scam apps from the App Store. The company has not provided details about measures to prevent similar apps from getting approved in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Apple's attempts to defeat a geofencing trick can be easily bypassed by hiding certain behaviors. This can be achieved by making an API call to a server with the app's build number, and having the API response control the availability of certain "secret" features. These features can be enabled only after the app has passed review. The author suggests that due to the various possible variations of this method, it is likely impossible to determine whether a particular app will behave in a certain way, making it an undecidable problem. Overall, the article highlights the ease with which certain behaviors can be hidden in apps, even if Apple tries to prevent them.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains how the author used a time-based trick to bypass Apple's restrictions. After submitting their app, they discovered that one of the buttons on the app had changed its behavior. The change allowed a "File Open" dialog to directly access the user's root directory.
