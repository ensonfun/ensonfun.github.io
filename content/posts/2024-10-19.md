**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 On October 12, 2024, a GIMPS computer reported a successful Fermat probable prime test, marking the potential discovery of a new Mersenne prime, the first in nearly six years, pending further verification through Lucas-Lehmer tests. GIMPS recently released version 30.19 of its software, improving the speed of certain computational stages. Significant updates, including the introduction of PRP proofs that allow for verification with minimal additional work, were highlighted, potentially increasing GIMPS' efficiency moving forward.

The project has validated all smaller Mersenne numbers from M(57885161), which was discovered eight and a half years ago, and it will no longer assign first-time tests without upgraded software. They also announced a collaboration with SRBase for trial factoring of large Mersenne numbers, although individual credit for that work will go to GIMPS. 

The article reflects on GIMPS' history, including its record of finding primes and mentions the largest known prime M(82589933), discovered in December 2018. The community-driven model encourages participation, demonstrating that anyone can contribute to discovering new Mersenne primes.

## 3. [The long road to lazy preemption in the Linux CPU scheduler](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41886256)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 The article discusses advancements in the Linux kernel's CPU scheduling, specifically the introduction of "lazy preemption" by developer Peter Zijlstra. This concept aims to simplify scheduling while improving performance. Currently, the kernel operates with four preemption modes—from minimal preemption (PREEMPT_NONE) to the more aggressive PREEMPT_RT mode, which enhances responsiveness but can impede system throughput. The existing approach uses the cond_resched() function to manage preemption, spread throughout the kernel, which can be seen as an inefficient workaround. The lazy preemption patches introduce a new flag, TIF_NEED_RESCHED_LAZY, which indicates when rescheduling is needed, allowing for a more streamlined and effective scheduling process. Despite the promising implementation, further work is required before it can be fully adopted.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses improvements in lazy-preemption work aimed at creating a smaller and simpler kernel that provides predictable latencies without extensive scheduler-related calls in the code. Although there is still a lot of work to be done, the outcome is expected to be beneficial, similar to the improvements made by EEVDF, which also simplifies and enhances the current system.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of preemption in systems, highlighting that higher preemption levels allow for quicker responses to events, which is often beneficial. However, this can negatively impact overall system throughput, particularly for workloads involving long-running, CPU-intensive tasks that are better off with minimal interruptions. Additionally, increased preemption may lead to higher lock contention. The article notes that there are various preemption modes suited for different workloads, and questions why preemption levels are not event-specific, as some events require faster response times than others.

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article explores the cultural significance and scientific interest in tattoos, specifically focusing on the Japanese tradition of irezumi. Dr. Fukushi Masaichi, a Japanese pathologist, saw tattoos as more than art; he was fascinated by their potential medical applications, particularly their ability to prevent scarring from diseases like syphilis. Beginning in 1907, he undertook the unusual task of preserving tattooed skin after the death of their owners, paying willing participants and creating a unique collection of 2,000 tattooed "pelts" and over 3,000 photographs documenting them. His preservation methods, both wet and dry, ensured the tattoos' designs remained intact.

Despite his success and respect within the tattoo community, much of his collection was lost due to air raids during World War II and the theft of a suitcase containing prized specimens during a trip to the U.S. After his death, his son, Dr. Fukushi Katsunari, continued his work. Although only 105 pieces of the collection are known to remain, they are housed in the Medical Pathology Museum of Tokyo University but are not publicly displayed.

## 8. [Knocker uppers: Waking up the workers in industrial Britain (2016)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41886956)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Before alarm clocks were prevalent, "knocker uppers" were employed to wake workers, especially in northern British mill towns and London. These individuals used long sticks to tap on bedroom windows, ensuring that shift workers rose on time. This trade flourished in areas where many could not afford watches and was particularly vital for dock workers whose schedules depended on the tides.

Knocker uppers, who often worked nights and slept during the day, faced challenges, such as waking paying clients without disturbing their neighbors. They adapted by using soft tapping methods. Cultural references to knocker uppers appear in works like Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations" and during notable events like the Jack the Ripper murders.

These figures, such as Mary Smith in East London and Granny Cousins in Dorset, operated into the early 20th century, illustrating a bygone practice of managing time before modern technology changed the way people approached getting up for work.

## 9. [Teaching old assert() new Tricks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41856815)

**Total comment counts : 2**

### Summary

 The article discusses the implementation and features of the assert() function in the Next Generation Shell (NGS), highlighting its consistency with the language's overall design. Key points include:

1. **Enhanced Functionality**: NGS assert() allows assert(EXPR, PATTERN) which follows the Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS), emphasizing pattern matching rather than predicate callbacks. This adjustment aligns with NGS’s broader use of pattern arguments across methods.

2. **Fluent Interface**: The assert function integrates smoothly into code, allowing chaining of conditions without cluttering with class methods, as methods exist outside of classes.

3. **Exception Handling**: NGS introduces assert() for callable expressions that can catch specific exceptions. This supports a variety of argument types, adhering to the "filling-the-matrix" principle, which aims for broad usability.

4. **Multiple Dispatch**: NGS utilizes multiple dispatch with methods evaluated in a bottom-up manner, using guards for method specificity.

5. **Domain-Specific Needs**: Additional facilities in NGS, like the retry() function, are designed relative to its “DevOps” focus, leading to the creation of retry_assert() for better error handling without overlapping concerns.

The article highlights how assert() serves as both a powerful and flexible tool in NGS and illustrates the language's design principles emphasizing usability and domain-specific functionalities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes a conversation with a senior developer who claims to use assert statements for critical security checks, including input validation and buffer size verification, asserting that his code is secure because of it. However, the author questions the effectiveness of this approach by asking if the compiler retains the assert statements when the code is compiled in non-debug mode, implying that asserts might not be reliable for security in production environments.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on their changing perspective regarding the use of assertions in code. Initially, they used to attach explanatory strings to their assertions for clarity. However, they now believe that assertions should indicate errors that require code changes and are thus not recoverable during runtime. The author argues that a simple assert, potentially accompanied by a comment explaining why it should never fail, is sufficient since the focus should be on the code itself when investigating issues. They acknowledge that while explanatory strings can be helpful, they now prefer straightforward assertions, sometimes supplemented by comments for clarity.

## 10. [Cross-Process Spectre Exploitation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41881487)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 In this article, Johannes Wikner discusses a cross-process Spectre attack he developed during his internship at Open Source Security, Inc. This exploit highlights flaws in the Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier (IBPB) for Intel's Golden Cove and Raptor Cove architectures, specifically how some return target predictions can persist across IBPBs due to buggy microcode. The article emphasizes that while IBPB is intended to protect against such vulnerabilities, certain user programs remain unprotected despite potential implementations of IBPB. It aims to persuade software developers to adopt IBPB while noting that even with IBPB, vulnerabilities remain.

Wikner outlines the mechanics of Spectre attacks, which leverage mispredictions in branch control flow to leak sensitive data through side-channel methods. The text explains the role of Branch Target Buffers (BTBs) in storing branch predictions and the importance of understanding how these predictions operate in the specter of security vulnerabilities. Additionally, he mentions Intel's recent patch addressing the IBPB issue, indicating improved safety for systems using updated microcode. Overall, the write-up serves to inform and advocate for stronger mitigations against Spectre-type attacks, particularly in user-level software.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the lack of concern among most software authors regarding cross-process Spectre attacks, noting that very few enable Indirect Branch Predictors Barrier (IBPB) protection. Google Chrome is highlighted as an exception, as Google takes extra measures to enhance user safety.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the shortcomings of microcode in fully flushing indirect branch predictions, which enables certain cross-process attack techniques to remain effective. The author expresses a lack of surprise at this oversight, noting that attention to side channel attacks has waned since the initial crises. Mitigating these attacks is complicated by testing challenges related to noise, which could have contributed to this oversight.

The piece highlights a common tension between performance and security, suggesting that many users mistakenly believe trusted applications do not require additional security measures. The author argues against this notion, especially in multi-user environments where unauthorized access to other processes' data is a risk. Comments on the Linux kernel indicate that developers prioritize performance, a mindset that has led to vulnerabilities in the past.
