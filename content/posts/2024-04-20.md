## 5. [The Basics of Legibility: A Short Guide for Non-Typographers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40085437)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article is about legibility in typography, specifically focusing on the shapes of letters and how they affect legibility. The author discusses the concept of familiarity and how people read best what they are familiar with. They provide an example comparing two different typefaces, illustrating that readers had an easier time reading the familiar typeface. 

The author then addresses a reader's comment about Apple's "San Francisco" typeface and why it is not the best choice for a user interface. They compare it to the "Japanese Sword Fallacy," explaining that while technically well-designed, San Francisco lacks personality and purpose. The author believes that typefaces like "Helvetica" and "Univers" are more suitable as UI typefaces due to their minimalistic nature and unique characteristics.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of functionality over aesthetics in user experience (UX) design. The author mentions an experience with a promotional code that had a visually appealing design but was difficult to enter due to the similarity between certain letters and numbers. The article emphasizes that while it is desirable to have both functionality and beauty in a user interface (UI), without functionality, a visually pleasing UI becomes pointless.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article questions the importance of font choice and argues that it is mainly subjective. While certain fonts, such as DIN, are more legible and less ambiguous in specific contexts like airport navigation, the difference between fonts like Fraktur and SF Pro is much larger. The author mentions the difference between font types in Chinese as well. They inquire about research on the legibility of fonts and where the point of diminishing returns might be for different activities. The author concludes that, while they appreciate a good programming font, most differences in font choice are based on personal preference and have little impact on functionality. They also mention a cultural difference in how digits are written, noting that handwritten notes often differ from computer fonts in the representation of certain numbers.

## 6. [U-M finds students with alphabetically lower-ranked names receive lower grades](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40097375)

**Total comment counts : 53**

### Summary

 A study conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan found that students with last names starting with letters towards the beginning of the alphabet receive lower grades compared to students with last names towards the end of the alphabet. The researchers analyzed over 30 million grading records from the university's online learning management system and discovered that the default ordering of students' submissions based on alphabetical rank contributes to this bias. Additionally, students with earlier alphabetically ranked last names received more negative and less polite comments from graders and had lower grading quality overall. The researchers suggest implementing random order grading as the default setting to address this issue and recommend hiring more graders or distributing the grading workload to mitigate bias. The study highlights the potential social impact of this unconscious bias on students' academic and career opportunities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses the order in which exams are graded in academia. They explain that the exams are shuffled randomly, with individuals picking up stacks and grading a specific exercise. However, when it comes to grading weekly exercise sheets, the order is shuffled for fairness. The author notes several effects that come into play, such as being less tired at the beginning and having a better mood towards the end. They also mention an alphabetic effect where being the first name on a list in elementary school resulted in being assigned special tasks, which annoyed them as a shy child.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author recalls their experience in K-12 school in the 80s and 90s, where students were seated in class based on their last names. Those with last names starting with A-D were seated in the front, while those with last names starting with U-Z were seated in the back. The author vaguely remembers that in high school, there were more high-achieving students with A-D last names and more troublemakers with U-Z last names. However, there is no way to determine if this seating arrangement directly caused these differences as there was no control group or experiment conducted.

## 7. [6th generation x86 CPU Comparisons](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40051972)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 This article is a comparative analysis of three 6th generation x86 CPUs: Intel P-II (Klamath, P6), AMD K6 (NX686), and Cyrix 6x86MX (M2). The author discusses the architectural differences and advantages of each CPU. The AMD K6, for example, combines elements from both the P-II and 6x86MX architectures, prioritizing short latencies and translating x86 instructions into queued RISC operations. The K6 has a short and efficient pipeline, with most stages performing complex tasks. However, it can only execute a maximum of two x86 instructions per clock, limiting its performance compared to the P-II, which can decode and execute three instructions simultaneously.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a video that compares the performance of Quake's software renderer on the Pentium MMX and the AMD K6 processors. It highlights how the Pentium MMX manages to outperform the AMD K6 due to a pipeline quirk in the FDIV instruction, despite being a previous generation, in-order design compared to the AMD K6's next generation, out-of-order design. The video provides in-depth analysis at the micro-architecture level.

## 9. [Dehydrated: Letsencrypt/acme client implemented as a shell-script](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40095325)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The article discusses Dehydrated, a shell-script client for signing certificates with an ACME-server such as Let's Encrypt. The client supports both ACME v1 and ACME v2, including wildcard certificates. It relies on the openssl utility for handling keys and certificates, and has dependencies such as cURL, sed, grep, awk, and mktemp. The software, ACME-protocol, and CA servers are relatively young, so there may be some issues. The article provides resources for getting started and troubleshooting, and mentions the availability of a configuration file and an IRC channel for discussion and suggestions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author used a tool called Certbot to implement SSL for multiple customer vanity domains. Certbot is a declarative tool where domains are specified in a text file and it automatically manages the certificates. However, it requires discrete commands to add, remove, or modify certificates, so the author had to keep track of the state. They used a management UI and wrote the domain file based on database configuration changes. If no changes or renewals were needed, nothing happened. The article also mentions that Certbot has great hooks, including a pre-check for http-01 validation to avoid failures. The author used S3 to store the validation files, making it work across a pool of load balancers. The author concludes that Certbot's focus on simplicity, configuration, hooks, and storage makes it an easy-to-use and powerful system.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the project Dehydrated has recently sold it to a company called apilayer. Despite the acquisition, the project will remain open source, and the author, Lukas, will continue to maintain it.
