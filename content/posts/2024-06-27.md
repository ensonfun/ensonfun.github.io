## 2. [Eplot: A new package for making charts in Emacs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40807923)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's search for an easy way to create simple plots. They explore various tools, including chart.el in Emacs and Google Finance's charts.

 This article discusses the recent discovery as to why there were no recent updates on the progress of fixing 10% of bugs in Emacs. It turns out that one person was solely dedicated to working on fixing these bugs, which is seen as an impressive accomplishment.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests using Emacs' feature of file- and directory-local variables for the chart configuration to improve user experience. This allows for more flexibility, such as generating data files without the need for manual modification before charting or easily plotting multiple data files without applying a header manually to each one.

## 3. [Google Sheets ported its calculation worker from JavaScript to WasmGC](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40808820)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The article discusses how Google Sheets, a product at Google, has started using WasmGC (WebAssembly Garbage Collection) on Chrome. The move, announced in 2022, involved the collaboration between the Google Sheets and Chrome teams to make optimizations and improvements. The Google Sheets calculation engine, originally written in Java and launched in 2006, transitioned to running in the browser using JavaScript in 2013. The migration process from the server to JavaScript required careful validation to ensure accuracy. The Sheets team developed an internal validation mechanism to compare results between different versions of the calculation engine. It was discovered that the JavaScript version was more than three times slower than the Java version. WasmGC, an extension of the WebAssembly specification, aims to bring garbage collected languages, such as Java, to the web at near-native speed. Google believes WasmGC has significant potential due to the popularity of garbage collected languages. The WasmGC MVP draft specification was published in 2019, and Google Workspace and Chrome partnered to evaluate WasmGC using the Sheets calculation engine. By mid-2021, a Java to WasmGC compiler was developed, and by the end of the year, a prototype version of Google Sheets running on WasmGC was created. Challenges were faced during the process, including the need to build tooling for profiling and heap dumps and finding or creating replacements for JavaScript libraries used in the existing implementation. Initial performance data showed that Sheets WasmGC was approximately two times slower than JavaScript, but optimization efforts were made to improve this. The Sheets team focused on replicating existing optimizations from other toolchains and continuously improving the performance of WasmGC.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the introduction of WasmGC, a garbage collector for WebAssembly, and its potential benefits. It highlights the possibility of GC-ed languages having smaller binary sizes compared to languages that manage memory, like Java. The article also mentions that if WasmGC becomes widely adopted, languages such as Clojure and Dart might start targeting WebAssembly instead of JavaScript. Additionally, it suggests that WasmGC could impact edge computing in the future.

It suggests that CSS anchor positioning may require complex workarounds and proposes that CSS features like container queries could solve this issue. The article also highlights the underlying issue of HTML and CSS not being orthogonal in terms of layout, and suggests that representing layouts as graphs or matrices instead of trees could be more beneficial.

## 5. [Federal whistleblowers are entitled to damages of missed future pay, court rules](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40804489)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in the case of Perlick v. Veterans Affairs Department that federal whistleblowers can receive compensatory damages if their firing causes harm to their future earnings. This ruling establishes that federal employees who face retaliation after reporting wrongdoing at their agencies are entitled not only to back pay but also financial compensation for the loss of potential future wages. The court specified that whistleblowers do not have to prove they had guaranteed jobs lined up but instead can show that the reprisal they faced caused defamation that harmed their chances at future employment. The case involved Deborah Perlick, who was fired by the VA in 2017 after reporting missing funds from a study on traumatic brain injury. Perlick argued that whistleblower protection laws entitled her to compensation for future lost earnings, in addition to back pay. The court found that federal whistleblowers can receive compensatory damages for future lost earnings, stating that Congress intended to provide "make-whole relief" to employees. The court remanded Perlick's case back to the Merit Systems Protection Board for a final decision. This ruling is seen as an important victory for federal whistleblowers who have been retaliated against for reporting misconduct.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 6. [25 years of video clips gone as Paramount axes Comedy Central wesbite](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40807032)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 ComedyCentral.com, one of the largest repositories of late-night videos, has removed clips from every episode of The Daily Show since 1999 and The Colbert Report, as well as other shows like The Opposition with Jordan Klepper and Lights Out with David Spade. The closure of ComedyCentral.com is part of Paramount's belt-tightening measures due to its significant debt. Fans can still find some clips on YouTube, but the complete collection is no longer available. Paramount is directing viewers to sign up for Paramount+ to watch Comedy Central shows, although older episodes of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report are not available on the streaming platform. The move has frustrated fans who suggest that Paramount should monetize the clips on platforms like YouTube to generate ad revenue. The removal of content from Comedy Central's website comes after other Paramount-owned sites, including MTV.com and CMT.com, also went dark.

 The author finds it interesting that studios who ran TV channels for many years struggled to transition to streaming. They believe that platforms like Paramount+, Disney+, and Peacock should have had an easier time gaining traction since they offer popular shows. The author suggests that the technology behind streaming has become standardized and affordable, and these studios already have the content, so setting up a basic ad-supported platform should have been profitable. They question why studios like Paramount would accumulate significant debt while trying to promote their streaming service, speculating whether it is because of the nature of their business or a lack of understanding of technology.
