**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses the work of mathematicians Akshay Venkatesh, Yiannis Sakellaridis, and David Ben-Zvi on the relationship between periods and L-functions in number theory. They sought to understand the connection between these two types of mathematical expressions, which had been a longstanding mystery. Through their collaborative efforts, they were able to create a two-way translation between periods and L-functions by representing them in terms of geometric spaces. This breakthrough contributes to the Langlands program, a research initiative that aims to link different areas of mathematics. The mathematicians' work provides a conceptual framework that unifies various mathematical connections and offers new insights into the relationship between arithmetic and geometry. However, their current findings apply to number systems that arise in geometry called function fields, and further work is needed to extend it to number fields, such as the real numbers. Overall, this research brings order and understanding to a previously perplexing relationship between periods and L-functions in number theory.

## 6. [Mathematician warns US spies may be weakening next-gen encryption](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37866421)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 A cryptography expert has claimed that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is deliberately weakening new encryption standards for post-quantum cryptography, which are designed to protect against attacks from powerful quantum computers. The expert, Daniel Bernstein, alleges that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is obscuring the NSA's involvement in developing the new encryption standards and has made errors in calculations regarding their security. NIST denies these claims. Bernstein believes that NIST's standards, which are used globally, could have significant flaws if the NSA is secretly inserting weaknesses into them. NIST is currently in the process of finalizing the standards for post-quantum cryptography algorithms.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) needs to be more transparent in its decision-making processes. The author suggests that if NIST cannot provide enough transparency for the public to verify their decisions, then the organization should be disbanded and replaced with something that better serves the public. The article also criticizes the use of technology for surveillance and the scrutiny of private citizens, emphasizing that those who serve in public roles should be the ones to give up some of their privacy. The author concludes by stating that simply telling people is not enough; NIST needs to be able to prove its transparency or step aside for better leadership.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses criticisms made by security researcher Berstein about the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and its selection process for new Post-Quantum-Crypto algorithms. Berstein argues that NIST is not properly evaluating the security thresholds of algorithms like NTRU and Kyber, and suggests that NIST may be favoring one algorithm over the other. He points out potential mistakes made by NIST and questions the transparency of the process. The article also mentions a lawsuit by Berstein seeking more information about the internal NIST process. While some may view Berstein as biased due to his involvement with NTRU, his reputation adds weight to his arguments.

## 10. [Making Rust supply chain attacks harder with Cackle](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37869597)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses a supply-chain attack in the context of a software engineer named Alex who built a tool using Rust. Alex's tool has multiple dependencies, one of which is a crate named foobar. The foobar crate was maintained by someone named Chris, but Bob, an enthusiastic contributor, was added as an owner. After updating her tool and releasing a new version, Alex discovers that foobar has introduced code that sends data to an unknown address on the internet, resulting in a security breach for her client. The article introduces Cackle, a code ACL checker that helps prevent supply-chain attacks. It explains how Cackle can be configured to define classes of APIs and restrict their usage to specific crates. The article also discusses the use of a sandbox and the integration of Cackle into the continuous integration (CI) process. It covers the analysis and resolution of problems detected by Cackle and notes that the tool currently only supports Linux. The article concludes by emphasizing that while Cackle can make it harder for attackers to introduce malicious code, it cannot completely eliminate the risk of supply-chain attacks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of using the "unsafe" permission in coding, which grants access to various functionalities such as file I/O, network access, and others. The author emphasizes that the problem with the "unsafe" permission is that it implies all other permissions and can lead to memory and thread safety vulnerabilities. While some argue that restricting the use of "unsafe" in most cases can mitigate risks, others point out that it is still relatively straightforward for attackers to perform network access using alternative methods. The author suggests that even though using Rust's std::net APIs may provide some level of protection, it is still not completely secure.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the limitations of using tools to detect supply chain attacks at the end-developer level. The author argues that developers typically do not care enough to use such tooling effectively. Additionally, the author points out the challenge of keeping track of changes in the standard library API. The article suggests that funding is needed to address systemic problems in languages and repositories. The author mentions personal experience with various methods and tools to tackle this issue but concludes that informing developers and allowing them to make decisions is not effective. While the article acknowledges that there is no foolproof defense and emphasizes the importance of layered security, it criticizes the current approaches as being inadequate.
