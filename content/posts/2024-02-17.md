 The author switched to buying Lenovo mini PCs, which are small in size (18cm x 18cm x 3cm) and affordable. They have proper casing and cooling. The author currently owns an i5-8500T with 32GB RAM and 2x SSDs. The PC consumes only 5W at idle with the help of auto-tuning using powertop.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article recommends several tips for ensuring the stability and reliability of a file system. 

1. Enable journaling mode on the file system.
2. Mount the file system in read-only mode and keep the "/var" directory in memory to prevent data corruption in case of power loss.
3. Forward all logs to a separate device with a proper uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to mitigate the impact of power loss.
4. Consider using multiple Raspberry Pis distributed around the house for added redundancy.
5. Implement an A/B partition system and perform system upgrades by completely rewriting the inactive partition. This ensures that there is always a functioning system partition in case of bugs in the new version.

The author has been using this approach with various small single-board computers for over 20 years and claims to have had great success.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their experience at an insurance company where management set a goal of 80% test coverage for the codebase. In order to meet this goal, developers began writing unnecessary unit tests for getters and setters in Java Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). The author reflects that this focus on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can lead to behaviors that do not align with the intended goals. They suggest that a few carefully designed end-to-end test scenarios would have had a better impact on software quality.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the results of TestGen-LLM, a testing tool. It states that 75% of the test cases built by TestGen-LLM were correct, 57% passed reliably, and 25% increased coverage. The author expresses concern about using TestGen-LLM due to the possibility of ratifying buggy behavior, especially if the code-base already has low test coverage. The author suggests segregating the generated tests in a special folder and treating them with suspicion.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the loss of technology, particularly in relation to crops, led to a decline in a society, similar to what happened in Tasmania. These losses were permanent and occurred either gradually through small populations or suddenly due to environmental or social shocks. The author also suggests that the relationship between population size and progress is a crucial aspect of human history and explains why technological development has only occurred relatively recently.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses various interesting aspects of the Canary Islands. It mentions that the islands have a favorable climate with some places being dry while others have a spring-like climate year-round. The article also states that the canaries originally arrived on the islands by boat but lost the ability to build or travel between islands. It suggests that the cultural attachment to the islands may be why people believe it is the best place in the world without exploring elsewhere. The presence of head injuries on old buried bodies indicates that the islands may not have been a paradise in the past or even today. The article mentions the presence of hippies living in caves and consuming wild figs and almonds. It also discusses the invention of a whistling language in La Gomera due to the presence of deep canyons on the islands.

## 5. [From engineer to manager: what I love, what I hate](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39406804)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The author discusses their experience transitioning from a front-end developer to an engineering manager. They highlight the positive aspects of a management position, such as the power to improve the product and team well-being, and the career opportunities it presents. They also mention the broader usefulness of management skills and the flexibility it provides in terms of future career paths. The author emphasizes that management can provide relief from keeping up with rapidly changing technologies and that it offers new challenges without a decrease in salary. However, they also acknowledge the downsides, including dealing with corporate bureaucracy and enforcing practices they may not believe in. Overall, the author presents management as a rewarding but challenging role.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article disagrees with some of the points made by the author. They believe that most engineering managers (EMs) are clustered at a certain level and promotions to higher positions are rare. They also mention that pure EMs who have been laid off struggle to find work, while those who are happy to return to individual contributor (IC) roles have no trouble finding employment. The author also finds it crazy to think that 5 years of experience is enough to solve most problems, as they still continue to learn and improve even after 18 years in the industry. However, they do agree that being a manager allows for more involvement in future planning and the opportunity to interact with high-level executives. The author also mentions that one common challenge of being a manager is witnessing the workings of senior management, which can be reminiscent of a high school clique.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author states that they have always identified with the role of an architect, but it seems to be disappearing as a job title. However, they believe that the need for the work still exists. They also mention that they have worked in other roles such as team lead/manager, Scrum Master, and product manager without the official title. The author suggests that being a good manager requires a different skill set from being an engineer, particularly having low neuroticism and the ability to remain calm and rational under stress. They argue that many lower-level managers lack these attributes and end up damaging the team and company. The author advises individuals who want to be managers to honestly assess their response to stress and how they handle it. They believe that the real differences between effective managers and everyone else lie in their ability to respond to stress, make decisions, and take responsibility.

## 6. [Big Pharma spends billions more on executives and stockholders than on R&D](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39405547)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 In a hearing held by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, chaired by Senator Bernie Sanders, it was revealed that pharmaceutical companies in the US are spending more money on executive compensation, dividends, and stock buyouts than on research and development for new drugs. While pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) do contribute to high drug pricing, their impact is smaller compared to pharmaceutical profits. The heart of the problem lies in pharmaceutical greed, patent gaming that extends monopolies, and powerful lobbying. The US spends significantly more for prescription drugs than other wealthy countries, with prices nearly three times higher. The report examined the launch prices of new drugs from three pharmaceutical companies and found that they have skyrocketed over the past two decades. For example, Merck's cancer drug Keytruda costs $191,000 in the US, but much less in other countries. The pharmaceutical trade group PhRMA argued that comparing US drug prices to prices in other countries harms patients and that Americans have broader and faster access to drugs.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Big Pharma's profits are influenced by taxpayer-funded research conducted by institutions like the NIH for drug discovery. It also mentions that Big Pharma has a strong lobbying arm that opposes Medicare negotiating lower drug prices.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the phrase "spending billions on stockholders" and argues that it is misleading because it misrepresents how businesses operate. It explains that giving profits to shareholders through stock buybacks is a way of returning value to them, rather than an expense. The analogy of a small business owner transferring money from the company account to her personal checking account is used to illustrate this concept.

## 7. [The Ute Tribe will construct one of the largest solar farms in the US](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39409653)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The Ute Mountain Ute Reservation plans to build a solar farm called the Sun Bear Solar Farm, in collaboration with the Canigou Group. The farm will consist of 2.2 million solar panels and span eight miles in length and one mile in width. The project aims to create over 500 local jobs and is scheduled to begin construction in 2024, with electricity production expected to start in 2026. The estimated annual capacity of the farm is 756 megawatts, and the project is projected to cost over $1 billion. The electricity generated will likely be connected to the Western Area Power Administration power line, although it is uncertain which regional entities the energy will be sold to. The Ute Mountain Ute tribe sees this venture as an opportunity to transition into renewable energy and create employment opportunities for tribal members.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses whether Native American tribes have the autonomy to efficiently build transmission lines. It suggests that the Navajo Nation alone has the potential to construct solar/wind energy systems and transmission lines within their reservation, which could connect to grids in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona. It also highlights the slow pace of transmission line construction in the US, taking decades. The article proposes that if the tribes have the freedom to import cheaper Chinese panels, a network of these nations could provide renewable energy coverage for the entire country.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article raises concerns about a billion dollar project that is expected to generate a large amount of power, but the company involved has made a vague statement about the possibility of consuming all of it within Colorado. The author expected the company to provide more specific details, such as production and consumption estimates, as well as a percentage figure, even if it was uncertain.

 The article is about a video where two individuals visit the site where an antenna used to be. The overgrowth of vegetation suggests that it has been at least one growing season since the antenna was removed. It appears that the antenna was not operational well before its removal.

## 9. [Juvenile great apes love to tease and annoy their elders, study finds](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39368792)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 Footage of great apes, including chimps, orangutans, bonobos, and gorillas, has shown that these animals engage in playful and sometimes aggressive teasing behaviors just like humans. The footage, taken at San Diego and Leipzig zoos, captured instances of apes poking, prodding, offering and pulling objects, body-slamming, sticking their faces in others' faces, pulling hair, tickling, and dangling things in front of each other. Researchers documented 142 clear instances of teasing in the footage, with most initiated by juveniles aged three to five years old. The teasing behaviors were provocative, intentional, and typically one-sided, with apes repeating their chosen moves or escalating the situation if the target didn't respond. The study also found similarities between juvenile ape teasing and human infant teasing, suggesting that teasing may help test social boundaries and strengthen relationships. The behavior of teasing may trace back 13 million years to the last common ancestor humans share with modern apes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The writer is expressing frustration with their children's behavior, describing them as annoying when they were younger and now as teenagers who communicate in grunts. The writer is making efforts not to react and hopes that their children will become understanding and considerate once they mature mentally. They are seeking confirmation and support in their struggle.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Scientists studied 75 hours of footage from San Diego and Leipzig zoos and observed 142 cases of great apes teasing each other. The teasing occurred at a rate of less than 2 instances per hour.

## 10. [Hyrum's Law](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39401973)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 The author discusses the differences between an interface and its implementations in software systems. They explain that while interfaces are meant to provide a clear separation between consumers and implementers, in practice, this theory breaks down as users start relying on implementation details. This leads to the creation of an implicit interface, where consumers expect certain behaviors from the implementation. Changes to the implementation must then conform to both the explicitly documented interface and the implicit interface to avoid violating consumer expectations. The author emphasizes the importance of considering this phenomenon when building and maintaining complex systems.
