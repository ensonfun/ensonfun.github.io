It provides the final code for creating the window and initializing the OpenGL context. The article focuses on the use of vertex buffer objects (VBO) and does not use vertex array objects (VAO). It explains how to bind the vertex and color data to the VBO and define the structure of the data using glVertexAttribPointer. The article also covers the implementation of the vertex and fragment shaders, and how to compile and link them into a program. Overall, the article provides a step-by-step guide for creating a window with modern OpenGL using shaders.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that it might be more practical to focus on XCB, a modern X11 client library replacement, rather than Xlib. Xlib has been a compatibility wrapper around XCB for about 15 years. The only situation where Xlib is necessary is for specific Vulkan-related tasks that do not have an XCB equivalent.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The user expressed disappointment that the article was not about implementing OpenGL functionalities by directly interacting with the GPU and X.

## 9. [Garbage Collection for Systems Programmers (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39873692)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses a method called Read-Copy-Update (RCU) for locklessly sharing data between threads in an operating system. RCU is used when data is read constantly but written rarely, and it allows the writer to make changes without blocking any readers. The article explains the process of using RCU and how it resembles a generational garbage collector for immutable data structures. RCU is utilized in various platforms like Linux, Facebook's Folly C++ library, and Rust's concurrency libraries. The article argues against the common belief that garbage collection is slower and less efficient than manual memory management, highlighting that general-purpose memory allocators have their own overhead and contention between threads.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two modern and parallel garbage collection (GC) techniques called MPL and MaPLe. These techniques propose provably efficient parallel GC based on disentanglement and provably efficient automatic granularity control. MaPLe (MPL) can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/MPLLang/mpl, and more information about Automatic Parallelism Management can be found at https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3632880. These techniques have received recognition, including a distinguished paper award in POPL 2024 and the ACM SIGPLAN dissertation award in 2023.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of garbage collectors (GCs) in memory management and argues that bespoke memory management solutions may offer better performance. The author believes that calling `free()` gives the memory back to the allocator, not the operating system, which is preferable due to slower system calls. The author performs a benchmark test comparing different memory management approaches and finds that a garbage collector results in a large number of unique pointers, which negatively impacts performance. The author concludes that GCs are more complex than alternatives like Rust's borrow checker and suggests that bespoke solutions, such as RAII with static lifetimes, may be more appropriate for certain scenarios.

## 10. [Some notes on Firefox’s media autoplay settings in practice as of Firefox 124](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39873169)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The author mentions their experience with streaming music on a digital music platform using Mozilla Firefox. They noticed that their Firefox instance at work seamlessly transitioned from one track to the next, while their home Firefox would pause between tracks. After investigating the settings, they discovered a difference in the media autoplay blocking policy. Their work Firefox had the default setting of allowing autoplay after interacting with the tab, while their home Firefox had a setting to require manual clicking to start the next track. The author explains that they originally set this to prevent YouTube from autoplaying a second video, but YouTube now has a disable autoplay setting. Since they listen to multi-track albums more often than YouTube videos, they decided to change the setting to allow autoplay on both instances of Firefox. They mention that they could avoid this issue by setting up a custom profile for the music source but haven't done so yet. Finally, they mention that they may go back to the previous 'stop after one track' behavior if they find themselves unintentionally listening to too many albums.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues for the need to implement stricter settings for autoplay, not just for video and audio but also for large GIF files. The author suggests categorizing these settings under "energy-saving" to benefit both the server and reduce CPU usage on the client side. The article also suggests reviewing the triggers for autoplay activation, as some websites start autoplaying media when users scroll down using the main scrollbar. The author believes that the scrollbar should not provide any hints to the website, particularly regarding media autoplay.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Firefox's default policy of allowing autoplay after interaction does not effectively stop autoplay on single-page applications (SPAs). While autoplay is initially blocked on the first page of SPAs like ESPN, it is enabled when navigating to subsequent pages as link clicks are intercepted and controlled by JavaScript. The author suggests that browsers should adopt a policy where click handlers for <a> elements are ignored on non-whitelisted sites to address this issue.
