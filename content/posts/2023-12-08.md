## 3. [Electric eel’s zap can transfer genes to nearby animals](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38555655)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 A research group from Nagoya University in Japan has made a startling discovery that electric eels can release enough electricity to genetically modify nearby organisms. The study found that electric eels, which can produce up to 860 volts of electricity, can transfer genetic material to small fish larvae, altering their DNA. This finding builds on the existing technique of electroporation, which creates temporary pores in cell membranes using an electric field to facilitate the delivery of molecules like DNA or proteins into target cells. The researchers exposed young fish to a DNA solution and observed markers indicating gene transfer in 5% of the larvae after prompting the electric eel to discharge electricity. This research suggests that organisms capable of generating electricity, like electric eels, could have a significant impact on genetic modification in nature. Previous studies have also shown a similar phenomenon occurring with naturally occurring electric fields, such as lightning affecting nematodes and soil bacteria. The researchers believe that further exploration into electric field research can uncover new biological phenomena and lead to breakthroughs in understanding living organisms.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the idea that electric eels in the Amazon River could serve as a power source and trigger genetic recombination in surrounding organisms due to their electric discharge. The author wonders if this process could potentially catalyze evolution. The article suggests that genetic recombination, by itself, does not drive evolution, but rather nature selects for or against certain traits.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses electroporation, a method used to introduce nucleic acids into cells without viral infection. It explains that cells can be squeezed or exposed to higher hydrostatic pressure to achieve this. The article also mentions knowledge of an internal project name for something.

## 4. [A genetically modified bacterium that outcompetes bacteria causing tooth decay](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38562939)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 Lantern Bioworks has developed a cure for tooth decay called BCS3-L1, or Lumina. Lumina is a genetically modified strain of the bacteria streptococcus mutans, which causes tooth decay. The modified strain produces an antibiotic that kills competing oral bacteria, metabolizes sugar into alcohol instead of lactic acid (which prevents tooth decay), and lacks a peptide that facilitates gene transfers with other bacteria. Lumina is applied by brushing teeth with a pumice-based product to remove existing bacteria and then swabbing Lumina on with a q-tip. There is minimal risk of Lumina spreading exponentially or causing a weird pandemic since similar strains are naturally occurring and existing mouth bacteria have a competitive advantage. However, accidental spread through kissing is possible, albeit at a slow rate. The transmission of Lumina to newborn babies through kissing is also a possibility.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that the claims about a particular strain outcompeting the same S mutans in causing cavities are weak and border on fraud. It points out that the strain would need to create and tolerate low pH environments, which would also cause cavities. Additionally, the article states that single applications of oral probiotics are not enough to cause persistent colonization, and that the existing microbiome in the mouth is difficult to outcompete. Furthermore, it mentions that there are other species besides S mutans that also cause cavities. The source of the article is a cofounder at Bristle Health, an oral microbiome company.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The FDA requested a study with 100 subjects who are young adults with removable dentures, living alone and far from school zones. However, the researcher felt it was nearly impossible to find 100 young people with dentures and eventually gave up on the project. The author finds it intriguing that the FDA has the power to request such specific requirements, suggesting it may be a way to hinder disruptive products that larger companies may not approve of.

## 8. [We investigated France's mass profiling machine](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38564808)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 This article discusses the use of predictive risk assessments in welfare systems across Europe, focusing on an algorithm deployed by France's social security agency. The algorithm attempts to predict benefit recipients who are committing fraud and assigns a risk score to over 13 million households. The article highlights evidence of discrimination, privacy invasions, and design flaws in these systems. Through analysis of the algorithm's source code and interviews with insiders and recipients, it is revealed that the algorithm targets vulnerable individuals while making it difficult for those in better situations to be investigated. The consequences for those flagged as high risk include invasive investigations and the potential loss of benefits. The analysis also found that the algorithm assigns higher scores to single parents, those struggling to pay bills, and individuals receiving disability benefits. Digital rights groups have advocated for greater transparency in algorithms deployed in the public sector. The article concludes by noting that the CNAF's models are constructed using logistic regression, a relatively simple machine learning algorithm, and trained on a representative dataset.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a problem with the algorithm implementation used by the CNAF (French National Family Allowance Fund). The issue is that the CNAF targets small unintentional errors rather than large-scale intentional fraud because fraud is more difficult to detect and prove. As a result, smaller and poorer families are disproportionately affected by these controls, as the algorithm was designed to do so. The article argues that no computational adjustment can fix this problem because it stems from the initial intent of the algorithm.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author questions the validity of studies that identify certain groups, such as male drivers aged 18-25 leaving clubs at night, as more likely to be flagged in police DUI checks. They argue that it is insufficient to simply identify these groups without assessing whether the targeting is correct or justified.

## 9. [How Many Hobbits? A Demographic Analysis of Middle Earth](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38562558)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The author of the article, who is a demographer and a fan of fantasy, attempts to estimate the population of Middle Earth based on demographic and agricultural rules similar to those of 1200 AD. Since Tolkien's writings do not provide specific population estimates, previous attempts have extrapolated population figures from army sizes. The author takes a different approach, dividing Middle Earth into regions and assigning population densities based on terrain mixes. Using these assumptions, the author creates a graph showing the population densities of different regions, with Lossarnach around Pelargir being the most densely settled area. Some surprising contenders for high population densities include the Anduin Vale, the Enedwaith, the western reaches of Eriador, and Minhiriath.

The reader provides further details about the correct location of Deadmen's Dike and its connection to the Greenway, which intersects the East Road near the West gate of Bree.

## 10. [Goodbye, clean code (2020)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38566235)

**Total comment counts : 93**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with refactoring code to remove duplication and achieve "clean code." They explain how they grouped similar code sections and created abstractions to eliminate repetition. However, their boss asked them to revert the changes, highlighting the importance of collaboration and considering the trade-offs of code refactoring. The author reflects on the obsession with clean code and how it can affect team dynamics. They encourage developers to think deeply about what they mean by "clean" or "dirty" code and consider the concrete engineering outcomes. Ultimately, they emphasize the importance of balancing code aesthetics with practicality and collaboration.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that the concept of "clean code" needs a re-brand because it is often met with resistance in the software development industry. The reasons for this push back include the belief that abstractions and design patterns make code more complex, time constraints preventing developers from writing clean code, and the perception that clean code is subjective and based on individual preferences. The author contends that the purpose of clean code is to simplify and make code easier to maintain as requirements change. They argue that the value of software lies in its ability to adapt over time and that clean code should support this. The author also mentions that if a refactor does not achieve these goals and instead makes it harder to maintain code in the future, then it cannot be considered "clean" code. The article concludes by stating that discussions about clean code should not be conflated with issues of process and etiquette, and that clean code itself is valuable regardless of individual behavior.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of code duplication and its relationship to clean code. It argues that code duplication can sometimes be beneficial, but it does not mean that clean code is unnecessary. The author criticizes a fellow developer for not refactoring repetitive code into a function and suggests that rejecting the pull request (PR) would have been a better approach instead of rewriting it entirely. The author warns against dismissing clean code and emphasizes the importance of code standards to maintain a functional codebase. They advise better communication and tact as the key takeaway from the experience, rather than disregarding clean code principles.
