## 1. [Affinity Studio now free](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45761445)

**Total comment counts : 90**

### Summary

 It warns that the user is on an old or unsupported browser and directs them to update to a recent version of a supported browser to continue using the product.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The Affinity suite, originally three standalone one-time-purchase apps by Serif, was acquired by Canva and relaunched as a single freemium app with AI features, marking a shift away from the old pay-once model.
- Concern: This transition risks degrading the classic experience by pushing a subscription funnel, limiting updates to older versions, and raising worries about data use and AI integration.
- Perspectives: Views range from seeing the change as a fair way to fund AI and ongoing development to lamenting the loss of a perpetual-license model and fearing creeping monetization, with calls for open-source alternatives.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 2. [The ear does not do a Fourier transform](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45762259)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 Sound vibrates the eardrum, and middle-ear bones boost the signal into the fluid-filled cochlea. There, the basilar membrane performs frequency separation: the stiff base handles highs, the flexible apex handles lows, with a logarithmic spatial mapping. Hair cells transduce motion into electrical signals via mechanically gated channels (“trapdoors”). Cochlear filtering sits between wavelet-like and Gabor-like tiling, trading temporal vs. spectral precision across frequencies. This likely reduces redundancy in natural sounds (per Lewicki’s ICA work) and reflects ecologically-driven efficient coding. Speech may occupy a distinct time-frequency space. The brain’s tonotopic organization links pitch logarithmically to frequency. A short-time Fourier view misses temporal detail.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The ear does not perform a pure Fourier transform but uses a time-localized frequency analysis intermediate between Fourier-like and wavelet/Gabor representations, discussed in relation to speech-evolution ideas and hearing models like CARFAC.
- Concern: There is potential mischaracterization and confusing terminology (Fourier Transform vs Fourier Series, and Gabor/wavelet labels) that could mislead readers about auditory processing.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic support for the reframing and related models (e.g., CARFAC) to critical objections about terminology and the appropriateness of the Fourier versus Fourier-series framing.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 4. [TruthWave – A platform for corporate whistleblowers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45763858)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 TruthWave aims to transform corporate culture by financially rewarding whistleblowers and building a global, justice-minded community. The platform lets individuals securely and anonymously share information about corporate wrongdoing, enabling tips that help hold the responsible parties to account. It invites revelations on the next major case.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion questions whether anonymous whistleblowing platforms can be trusted and how transparency, insider protection, and funding models affect credibility. 
- Concern: Anonymity and opaque leadership may erode trust and put whistleblowers at risk, and the revenue model (donations/large payouts) could reflect misaligned incentives or rent-seeking intermediaries. 
- Perspectives: Some view anonymity as necessary but harmful to credibility, others insist on named teams to build trust, and there is skepticism about TruthWave’s payout-driven approach while noting that platforms like Nostr enable direct tipping without intermediaries. 
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 5. [Minecraft HDL, an HDL for Redstone](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45763877)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 Minecraft HDL is a Verilog-based synthesis flow that maps digital circuits to Minecraft redstone. It demonstrates a 6-input multiplexer (a, b, c, d, x, y) and the resulting Minecraft circuit. Created by three McGill University undergraduates (Electrical, Computer & Software Engineering) under supervisor Brett H. Meyer, it aims to illustrate digital design concepts with Minecraft. It’s educational, not production-ready: it’s imperfect, cannot synthesize sequential circuits (no memory/state), and simple designs are required due to Minecraft’s block limits. It can generate many Verilog circuits, and includes a 2-bit adder example.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A Verilog-to-Minecraft Redstone synthesizer project is being discussed, including interest in optimizing passes and how to model flip-flops in Minecraft, along with a note on Minecraft’s limitation regarding feedback.
- Concern: The main worry is that Minecraft circuits cannot have feedback, which would impede realistic digital designs.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic appreciation for a fun, seemingly useful project to disappointment about the lack of feedback support in Minecraft circuits.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [987654321 / 123456789](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45712620)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 Let denom(b) be the base-b number formed by digits in ascending order and num(b) the one formed by digits in descending order. Then num(b)/denom(b) is very near the integer b−2, with a fractional part about (b−1)^3/(b^b−b^2+b−1). In fact num(b)−(b−2)denom(b)=b−1, so num(b)/denom(b)=(b−2)+(b−1)^3/(b^b−b^2+b−1). Examples: base 16 ≈ 14 + 16^-14; base 9 ≈ 7.000000628; base 8 ≈ 6.00000527. Formulas: num(b)=((b^b)(b−2)+1)/(b−1)^2 and denom(b)=(b^b−b^2+b−1)/(b−1)^2 (OEIS A051846, A023811).

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread is a playful investigation of numerical patterns, calculator quirks, and base-dependent relationships, tying them to series, fractions, and proofs.  
- Concern: A key worry is that computational demonstrations or scripts can introduce bugs and are not a substitute for rigorous, constructive proofs.  
- Perspectives: Some participants celebrate the interplay between computation and math and share many examples, while others caution against relying on scripts as proofs and emphasize mathematical rigor.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 7. [Springs and bounces in native CSS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45736461)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 Historically, CSS transitions used Bézier curves, which can’t mimic springs or bounces without JavaScript. The new linear() timing function lets you model motion by drawing straight-line segments between user-specified points (0 to 1). This non-Bézier approach can produce springy, overshooting motions beyond the target when you supply more points. Hand-picking values yields choppy results; using many points (e.g., 50) looks much smoother. Developers should use tools like Linear() Easing Generator to compute these datasets automatically. Browser support is about 88% as of Oct 2025, with fallbacks for older browsers.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A Chrome for Android bug causes background audio to drop by about 50% when scrolling a CSS demo page, later identified as caused by autoplay of Easing Wizard's video.
- Concern: The concern is that autoplaying video is causing unintended audio level changes, leading to a degraded user experience.
- Perspectives: Perspectives range from a user reporting the issue and seeking help to a clarification that the culprit is the video's autoplay, along with praise for the page design.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [Launch HN: Propolis (YC X25) – Browser agents that QA your web app autonomously](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45762012)

### Summary

 error

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on AI-driven testing agents and their ability to automate UI testing, onboarding flows, abuse/fraud scenarios, and deployment strategies, including questions about cross-agent testing, outputs (e.g., Playwright scripts), and mobile support.
- Concern: The main worry is whether automated testing can reliably catch subtle UI issues and realistic abuse scenarios while safely handling deployment and test data (e.g., canary rollouts, long-lived test identities, privacy/resource needs).
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic interest in broader automation (testing other agents, onboarding automation, canary analysis, and script output) to skepticism about AI reliably understanding UI and simulating real-world abuse, with requests for features like mobile support and end-to-end automation.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 9. [Show HN: I made a heatmap diff viewer for code reviews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45760321)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The heatmap tool color-codes each diff line or token by the amount of human attention it likely needs, aiming to flag items worth a second look—not just bugs. Examples include hard-coded secrets, odd crypto modes, and gnarly logic. To try it, replace github.com with 0github.com in a PR URL. It clones the repo into a VM, runs gpt-5-codex on every diff, and outputs a JSON structure parsed into a colored heatmap. The project is open source.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on a code-review heatmap tool (cmux-agent) that integrates with GitHub and weighs its usefulness against privacy and policy concerns, including opt-out options.
- Concern: The main worry is privacy and control risks from granting broad GitHub permissions, potential TOS issues, and unclear opt-out or enforcement mechanisms.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from optimistic about the tool’s benefits for reviewers and large PRs to skeptical about its cost, AI reliability, and privacy implications, with calls for better UX and opt-out controls.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 10. [Free software scares normal people](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45760878)

**Total comment counts : 64**

### Summary

 Normal people struggle with video conversion because free software often has power-user UIs like Handbrake. The author built Magicbrake, a simple frontend that hides Handbrake’s complexity and does one thing: convert tricky videos into a small, universally playable MP4 with a single button. If users need more features, they can use Handbrake directly. The broader point: apps should hide seldom-used functions to boost productivity, a principle that can improve other tools (media servers, audio editors, network monitors) by applying the 80/20 rule.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread discusses balancing simple, focused UIs with powerful, configurable features by using progressive disclosure and user profiling to accommodate diverse users, especially in free/open-source software.
- Concern: The main worry is that UI simplification can alienate power users or create unstable, bloated interfaces, and that free software often lacks resources for strong UX.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from defending a single-use-case UI with strict scope, to designing for the median user with optional advanced modes, to applying UX principles like progressive disclosure and iterative testing to reconcile differing needs.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
