## 1. [Supabase MCP can leak your entire SQL database](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44502318)

**Total comment counts : 71**

### Summary

 The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables LLMs to interface with external tools but introduces risks, as demonstrated by an attack on Supabase. An attacker can exploit the integration to leak sensitive SQL data by submitting a crafted message that the AI assistant mistakenly interprets as a command, bypassing Row-Level Security (RLS). The AI assistant, holding elevated privileges, can execute SQL queries that reveal private information when a developer reviews support tickets. The attack highlights flaws in overprivileged access and trusting user input. Precautions, such as readonly access during agent initialization, can mitigate this risk.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 A Supabase engineer reported recent mitigations against prompt injection attacks, including promoting read-only access, wrapping SQL responses to deter malicious commands, and implementing E2E tests to protect less capable models. These measures have effectively reduced attack success rates, although prompt injection remains an ongoing challenge. Future plans involve refining token-level permissions, enhancing documentation to inform users about security risks, and developing detection models for prompt injection attempts. The engineer noted issues with General Analysis not adhering to responsible disclosure protocols.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses security vulnerabilities in admin apps, specifically relating to XSS attacks and their adaptation to LLMs. It describes how untrusted user-generated content can compromise admin applications like "Cursor and the Supabase MCP." In traditional XSS, malicious HTML and JavaScript submitted in support tickets can hijack an admin's session. The article highlights that the same principle applies here, substituting HTML with LLM instructions, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems.

## 2. [Breaking Git with a carriage return and cloning RCE](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44502330)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 Using `git clone --recursive` on untrusted repositories can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities in Git on Unix-like platforms. The issue arises from how Git's configuration handling processes line endings, specifically in the `.gitmodules` file, which can be exploited to manipulate file paths during submodule checkouts. This manipulation can result in writing files to unintended directory paths, posing a security risk. Users are urged to update to fixed versions of Git and related software to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a security vulnerability (CVE-2024-32002) in Git where submodule clones can be manipulated to write files into a `.git` directory rather than the intended submodule worktree. This allows the execution of malicious git hooks during the cloning process, posing a risk of remote code execution without user inspection. The exploit involves a trivial modification of existing methods, highlighting the seriousness of the issue, as it enables malicious code to run seamlessly during a legitimate operation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Using ad-hoc Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for configuration poses significant issues due to the lack of formal grammar specifications, leading to inconsistent parsing and serialization implementations. If the parser and writer become out of sync, it creates potential errors. The key takeaway is to maintain a single source of truth and generate all related components from it to avoid discrepancies.

## 5. [Epanet-JS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44464628)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 epanet-js is a web application that integrates EPANET's hydraulic simulation algorithm with modern mapping for water utility system planning. Developed by Luke Butler and Sam Payá from Iterating, it offers a significant improvement over traditional, expensive software. The tool runs in browsers using a WASM-based engine, attracting interest for its open-source roots, stemming from the author's previous project, Placemark. The core library is open-sourced under the Functional Source License, allowing community contributions. Overall, epanet-js is a promising resource for hydraulic simulation, appealing to both professionals and enthusiasts in the field.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Autodesk and Bentley dominate the hydraulic modeling software market, having developed proprietary versions of the EPANET engine without contributing to its open-source foundation. While these commercial tools integrate GIS and facilitate model scenario analysis, they are complex and costly, with Autodesk charging about $10,000 per year per user and Bentley $16,000. The US EPA offers a simpler, free tool that lacks GIS integration. A new software aiming to balance these offerings is being launched with an affordable pricing model, allowing users the option to host their own version. Additional resources and context are available through linked websites.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 epanet-js is a browser-based tool that offers full simulations using a WASM-based engine, providing a free alternative to costly traditional software priced at $16,000 annually and limited to Windows. It utilizes the same EPANET engine but offers significant improvements. Though the author has no personal use for epanet-js, they praise it as an exemplary model of what free software should achieve.

## 9. [Brut: A New Web Framework for Ruby](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44502463)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 Brut is a user-friendly web framework for Ruby, distinct from others as it lacks controllers, verbs, or resources. It focuses on building pages and single-action handlers using server-generated HTML, while allowing full use of JavaScript and CSS. Brut includes features like OpenTelemetry instrumentation and a Sequel-powered data layer, enabling rapid app development without needing Ruby installation. It emphasizes simplicity, reducing boilerplate compared to Rails and avoiding complex architectural debates. The goal is to create enjoyable web applications, leveraging the capabilities of modern browsers and Ruby 3.4.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author prefers an approach focused on forms and pages in app development, where interactions are driven by forms and links. JavaScript enhancements simply trigger existing forms, ensuring clear visibility of the interaction routes through HTML inspection. The author argues that controllers are overused, advocating instead for a structure centered on forms, backend models, and views, suggesting that much of the validation typically handled by controllers can be managed more elegantly by the framework.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article expresses enthusiasm for using advanced programming concepts like monads, functors, and algebraic data types in projects, particularly for side projects or those involving a small, experienced team. The author encourages developers to integrate these ideas into their business logic if they desire, emphasizing flexibility and personal preference in acquiring and applying complex programming knowledge.
