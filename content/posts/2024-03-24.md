 This article discusses a failed package installation due to unresolved repositories and a potential solution using the cloud. The author suggests that instead of trying to fix the issue, it is better to kill the machine or remove it from the pool and get a new one. By doing so, the machine and the application are likely to come up clean, resolving the incident.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of containerizing servers and the issues that arise with security scanning tools. Many tools in docker images can be flagged as unnecessary and potentially aiding attackers. To address this, the article suggests keeping such tools in a separate volume as static binaries or installing them with the mount path as the install prefix. If debugging is required, the volume can be temporarily mounted as read-only. Another challenge discussed is the impact of enabling specific kernel features for debug tools on other containers running on the same host.

## 4. [The Super Mario Maker community faces its final boss](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39754943)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 A group of players called "Team 0%" has spent years clearing levels in the original Wii U Super Mario Maker that had never been beaten by anyone except for their original uploaders. They have narrowed the list of uncleared levels to one final level named "Trimming the Herbs." However, they face a deadline as Nintendo plans to shut down the Wii U's gameplay servers on April 8. The team is aiming to completely beat the game before that date. The effort started in 2017 when a player created a definitive list of uncleared levels. Team 0% was able to clear all the 2015 levels, but they had to contend with thousands of newer uncleared levels. In March 2021, Nintendo stopped allowing new uploads, which made the goal of fully beating the game more achievable. The team has gained attention from popular streamers, attracting more participants.

## 7. [Speaking without vocal cords, thanks to a new AI-assisted wearable device](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39804138)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 A team of engineers at UCLA has developed a small device that can help people with dysfunctional vocal cords regain their voice function. The device, measuring just over 1 square inch, is attached to the skin outside the throat and uses machine-learning technology to detect movement in the larynx muscles and translate those signals into audible speech with nearly 95% accuracy. The bioelectric system is made up of two components: a sensing component that detects and converts muscle movement signals, and an actuation component that turns those signals into voice expression. The device is non-invasive, lightweight, and can be easily adhered to an individual's throat. It has the potential to provide a wearable, non-invasive option for those with voice disorders, who currently may have to undergo surgical interventions or voice therapy for recovery. The researchers plan to further develop the device and test it in people with speech disorders.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a device that decodes silent speech using the larynx. However, the decoding capability is limited to five different sentences. The media has exaggerated the device's abilities as the larynx alone does not provide enough information for accurate decoding. The article suggests that decoding becomes more accurate when the device also detects movements of the lips, tongue, and jaw. The article refers to additional research that demonstrates high accuracy in decoding general English with these additional factors considered. The author also mentions conducting experiments using only the larynx recording, which resulted in poor performance even with a small vocabulary. This explains why the device was limited to a task involving five sentences.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article critiques a hyperbole called "Speaking," which claims to allow users to accurately say five phrases with a 95% success rate after repeating each sentence 100 times. The author argues that this hyperbole is useless because the sentences are easily distinguishable mainly based on their length. The author expresses surprise that anyone would find this tool useful. The article also mentions a brief demonstration involving five sentences for training the algorithm. The author concludes by stating their skepticism towards press releases from universities, suggesting they are often exaggerated.
