## 3. [What I Learned Writing an Album in Just Intonation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41238392)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article discusses a musical concept called just intonation (JI), which involves playing "between the notes" of the 12-tone scale. JI is often described as the natural way music should sound. The author shares their experience of writing an album in JI and explains that understanding JI requires letting go of the familiar 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) system. In JI, intervals are based on natural ratios, while in 12TET, they are approximations. The article explores the theory behind JI and its potential for creating more consonant harmonies. The author also discusses the challenges of working with JI in music-making tools and suggests creative approaches to using alternative sets of tones that don't mimic the 12TET system. They introduce a concept called freestyle JI, which involves assigning individual frequencies to each note, but acknowledge its impracticality.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests tuning a guitar in a way that allows for perfect intonation of chords. By arranging the strings in a certain way, certain chord shapes can have perfect roots and 5ths, with one string being slightly flat compared to equal temperament. This tuning allows for perfect intonation of not only the root chord but also other chords in the key family when playing the same chord shape up the neck. In some cases where a flat string cannot be used, additional pressure can be applied to bring it back into tolerance. Mastering this technique can make the guitar sound more in tune with itself, providing a wonderful sensation for the player.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is seeking feedback on an article they wrote about just intonation, harmonic lattices, and their relationship with temperaments. They admit that despite reading about the theory, they struggled to understand the concepts until they applied them themselves. The author attempted to create an article that would provide immediate understanding using interactive figures, but they now believe they may have failed in the same way as their early readings did. They acknowledge that the article may be difficult to comprehend for those unfamiliar with the topic and express a need for a slower-paced, longer series to help people understand these subjects.

## 4. [Reversing the AMD Secure Processor (PSP) – Part 2: Cryptographic Co-Processor](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236993)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 The article discusses the AMD Secure Processor (PSP) and its essential component, the Cryptographic Co-Processor (CCP). The CCP is responsible for hardware-accelerated cryptography and can also be used for mass copy operations and firmware loading. The latest version of the CCP, CCPv5, has more functionality and versatility compared to previous versions. The CCP interface includes local storage blocks and command queues for job submission. The storage blocks, known as Local Storage Blocks (LSBs), have a maximum of 8 LSBs with 16 slots each. Commands sent to the CCP can access the LSBs through virtual addressing. Five command queues can be used for submitting commands to the CCP. Each queue can hold 16 commands, and the commands are described using control words, length, and pointers for source, destination, and key information. The CCP supports various engines and modes, including decompression, symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, and hashing. The CCP can perform I/O with different types of memory, including system memory, LSB memory, and local static RAM. The article also mentions the use of the spiRead() function in the PSP's Initial Program Loader (IPL) binary, which reads data from the SPI flash. The function supports compressed and non-compressed reading and involves copying data to/from the local memory.

## 6. [Aristotle – How to live a good life](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41263951)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 Aristotle believed that to live a good life, humans must fulfill their unique function, which is to have an excellent soul. This excellence is achieved through a clear intellect and a noble character. Aristotle identified theoretical virtues such as art, intelligence, scientific knowledge, prudence, and wisdom, which help us understand the truth and make practical decisions. In addition, a good character is essential for a good life and involves finding the right balance between extremes. Courage and temperance are examples of finding the mean between cowardice and recklessness, and gluttony and abstinence respectively. Developing character is a lifelong process that requires study and habituation. Aristotle also argues that happiness is not solely about pleasure, but rather about living a fulfilled and virtuous life that aligns with our nature. While pleasure can contribute to happiness, it is not essential. Ultimately, happiness is the pursuit of excellence.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article questions whether the importance of happiness is being downplayed or if it is assumed to naturally come from being virtuous. The author also suggests that Aristotle's arguments may not apply to people who are suffering or struggling financially.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article suggests that it is helpful to simplify Aristotle's teachings into a logical order. To achieve this, it is important to understand the Greek terms he uses. The article references the first few lines of the Nichomachean Ethics, which discuss how all beings have a good for themselves. This introduction incorporates metaphysics, logic, and provides an overview of the argument structure. The author also shares their personal dislike for moving images.

 The author is unsure if there are many people testing commands currently, as some commands are taking over 10 seconds to run. They don't consider this a fair benchmark because system speed varies. The author also mentions that they only received a "partially_correct" response for some commands, but they aren't sure if it was due to the level of detail or phrasing. Finally, they note that their success rate is 50% with a mean time to resolution of 1.80 minutes, while PARITY AI SRE has a success rate of 70% with a mean time to resolution of 2 minutes. The author concludes that at least they are faster than an AI.

## 9. [Why did Borland ignore the Macintosh market?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41237857)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 The article discusses the history of Borland, a software development company, and its lack of presence in the Macintosh market during the 80s and 90s. Despite having technically superior products, Borland chose to focus on the IBM PC market instead. The author suggests that the small size of the Macintosh market and the significant differences in UI and hardware between Mac and PC platforms deterred Borland from investing in Mac development. Additionally, Borland's main products, such as Turbo Pascal and Delphi, were originally designed for CP/M and DOS environments, making it difficult to adapt them to the Macintosh platform. Overall, the article highlights why Borland did not prioritize the Macintosh market and emphasizes the challenges faced in cross-platform software development during that time.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their experience with programming on the Macintosh using Borland's Turbo Pascal. They took an introductory programming class at the University of Kansas where they learned Pascal. They were surprised to learn that the class used Macintosh computers, specifically running a version of Turbo Pascal. They later bought their own Macintosh and found a copy of Turbo Pascal for Macintosh from a professor. They used Turbo Pascal for about a year before switching to THINK Pascal. The author mentions recently finding their old Turbo Pascal floppies and programs from the 1980s. They speculate that Borland got involved with Mac programming early, hoping that it would become popular, but ultimately left when it did not.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that Apple's presence outside of the United States was practically nonexistent. In Portugal, for example, there was only one distributor in Lisbon called Interlog. The only way to purchase Apple products was to physically visit the distributor or call in after seeing advertisements in computer magazines. However, this was not ideal as the prices of Apple computers were very expensive compared to alternatives in the PC market. Apple only gained relevance outside of the US after acquiring NeXT.
