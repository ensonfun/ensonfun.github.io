## 1. [Reverse Engineering iOS 18 Inactivity Reboot](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42167633)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article discusses the security differences between the "Before First Unlock" (BFU) and "After First Unlock" (AFU) states on an iPhone:

1. **BFU State**: 
   - When an iPhone is first powered on or after a restart, it requires the user's passcode to unlock the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP), which holds the keys to decrypt user data. During this state:
     - Face ID and Touch ID do not work; only the passcode can unlock the phone.
     - The iPhone cannot connect to Wi-Fi because Wi-Fi passwords are encrypted.
     - Cellular connections are possible if the SIM isn't PIN-protected, but caller ID won't display contact names due to encryption.
     - Notifications can be received, but message previews are not shown.

2. **AFU State**:
   - After the passcode is entered, the iPhone decrypts user data, allowing:
     - Connection to Wi-Fi networks.
     - Display of contact names and message previews on notifications.
     - Use of biometric authentication methods like Face ID or Touch ID.
   - This state is less secure because if the lock screen is bypassed, an attacker can access decrypted data.

3. **Security Implications**:
   - The AFU state increases vulnerability as attackers can exploit various security flaws to access data without knowing the passcode. These vulnerabilities can be in software, hardware, or through wireless protocols.
   - Law enforcement often keeps seized iPhones in AFU state to access data without updates, making them susceptible to known exploits.

4. **Recent Findings**:
   - A document discussed in the article mentions an "inactivity_reboot" feature introduced in iOS 18.1 and modified in iOS 18.2. This feature triggers a reboot after 72 hours of inactivity, regardless of Wi-Fi connectivity, suggesting it's not related to wireless security but possibly to enhance security by forcing a BFU state after long periods of inactivity.

5. **Exploits and Law Enforcement**:
   - Exploits for older vulnerabilities can still be used on iPhones not updated to the latest software, which is common in forensic scenarios or by criminals to access valuable data like bank accounts or for blackmail.

The article concludes with the author's intention to reverse engineer the changes in the latest iOS updates related to this inactivity reboot feature to understand its security implications better.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the "After First Unlock" (AFU) state in Apple's data encryption framework. By default, data encrypted with the AFU key becomes accessible after the device is unlocked for the first time post-reboot. However, developers have the option to choose different keys that can enforce stricter access controls, such as making the data inaccessible whenever the device is locked. Apple itself uses this stricter key for sensitive data like health information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges in replacing TCP in data centers due to issues of standardization and implementation:

1. **Standardization and Compatibility**: Any new protocol must be universally supported across all data center hardware and software, from firewalls to load balancers, which is a complex and costly requirement.

2. **Talent and Expertise**: There's a need for engineers who are as proficient with the new protocol as they are with TCP/IP, adding to the cost and complexity.

3. **Vendor Support**: Software support for the new protocol depends on vendors, which is out of the control of the data centers unless the new protocol is encapsulated within TCP/IP, negating its unique benefits.

4. **Economic Considerations**: The total cost of transitioning to a new protocol could be extremely high, potentially funding widespread 400G bandwidth upgrades instead. This leads to a problem of diminishing returns, where the benefits do not justify the costs for most organizations except perhaps the largest cloud providers.

5. **Trust and Adoption**: Even when large companies like Google offer alternatives like QUIC, there's skepticism about their motives, making widespread adoption unlikely.

In summary, while TCP isn't ideal for modern data center needs, the barriers to adopting a new protocol are significant due to costs, complexity, and trust issues.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

The main point is the lack of intuition and context for readers to critically analyze whether these architectural choices are optimal or how they stack up against alternatives.

## 6. [Against Best Practices](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42170552)

**Total comment counts : 49**

### Summary

 Martin Tournoij critiques the concept of "best practices" in programming, arguing that they often do more harm than good when applied dogmatically. He believes these practices are frequently misused by zealots or inexperienced programmers as arguments from authority rather than engaging in substantive discussion about their applicability. He provides several examples:

1. **Postel’s Law** - He questions the universal application of Postel's advice on protocol implementation from 1980, suggesting it was context-specific and not a universal "law."

2. **Programming Practices** - He discusses common programming advice like avoiding globals, not using GOTO, and adhering to DRY principles, arguing that while these have merit, their absolute enforcement can lead to impractical or overly complicated solutions.

3. **SOLID and 12 Factor App** - He finds some principles within these methodologies useful but criticizes the rigidity with which they are sometimes followed, suggesting they often complicate rather than simplify development.

Martin emphasizes that blindly following "best practices" can lead to a lack of critical thinking and adaptability, which are crucial in finding the best solutions for specific situations. He calls out the "Safety Fallacy," where arguing against established practices or regulations feels like arguing against safety itself, making it hard to push back against outdated or contextually inappropriate rules. He invites feedback and discussion via his contact information and notes that his critique is licensed under a CC-BY 4.0 license.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses insights from Dan Morena, CTO at Upright.com, who emphasizes the uniqueness of each startup. He argues against following generic "best practices" in startup development, suggesting that startups should instead focus on what specifically works for them. The analogy used compares startup building to military conquests, where success comes from mastering specific, tangible elements rather than abstract concepts like conquering a country. Morena's philosophy is that understanding and adapting to the unique attributes of your startup is key to success, rather than adhering to conventional wisdom or broad strategies.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the inevitability of certain individuals—referred to as "zealots, idiots, and assholes"—misusing any given concept or practice to impose it aggressively on others. The author suggests that since this behavior is an unchangeable aspect of human nature, the best approach is to ensure that the ideas these individuals fixate on are at least somewhat beneficial or reasonable. For example, it's better for these individuals to advocate for practices like test-first development rather than harmful or less productive ideas. The underlying point is to mitigate damage by promoting ideas with some inherent value, even if they are not perfectly applied or understood.

## 7. [You could have designed state of the art positional encoding](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42166948)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 The article discusses the development of positional encoding in transformer models, starting with the need to encode positional information into the self-attention mechanism, which inherently does not account for the order of tokens in a sequence. Here's a summary:

1. **Problem Identification**: Without positional encoding, the transformer's self-attention mechanism treats tokens identically regardless of their position in the sequence, leading to loss of context and meaning.

2. **Objective**: The goal is to devise an encoding method for positions that:
   - Allows for unique identification of each token's position.
   - Maintains consistency across different sequence lengths.
   - Simplifies the mathematical relationship between positions.
   - Generalizes beyond training data distributions.
   - Can be applied deterministically.
   - Extends to higher dimensions for multimodal data.

3. **Initial Approach**: The simplest method considered is adding the integer position value to each token's embedding. This approach, however, leads to issues with magnitude, where positional information might overwhelm the semantic content of the tokens.

4. **Refinement**: An attempt to normalize position values by dividing by sequence length was considered but found to be problematic as it changes with each sequence length, violating the consistency requirement.

5. **Further Development**: The article hints at exploring more sophisticated methods to ensure positional encodings remain within a manageable range (0 to 1) without compromising the desired properties.

6. **Conclusion**: The process of improving positional encoding is iterative, aiming to refine these encodings towards achieving the properties listed, eventually leading to advanced techniques like Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) used in modern transformers like Llama 3.2. 

The article sets the stage for understanding why and how positional encoding has evolved, highlighting the challenges and considerations in designing such systems.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a query about the method of integrating positional encodings with token embeddings in neural networks. The author questions why positional encodings are typically **added** to token embeddings rather than being **concatenated** with them. They express interest in understanding the rationale behind this common practice.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the flexibility of using rope (a type of encoding scheme) during model inference without the need for retraining. The author enjoys experimenting with different relative positions in token encoding:

1. **Encoding Flexibility**: Rope allows for various encoding schemes which can influence how a model interprets and processes tokens.

2. **Behavioral Variations**: By altering the rotation of keys versus queries, different model behaviors can be elicited. This means that the alignment between keys and queries does not always have to be identical, leading to varied outcomes.

3. **Positioning and Token Interaction**: The exact position of tokens isn't critical when they are spaced apart. For instance, shifting keys around a particular position (like position 100) while keeping the query at that position gives more leeway in manipulating the values, especially for tokens further back in the context. This allows for creative manipulation of how tokens interact within the model's understanding.
