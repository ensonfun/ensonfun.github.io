## 1. [Large Balloon Reflector: a potentially game-changing antenna design](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38043955)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 A young engineer named Christopher Walker came up with an innovative idea while making chocolate pudding. He realized that the warped plastic wrap over the pot could be used to create a revolutionary inflatable device for space-based sensing and communications. The concept, known as the Large Balloon Reflector (LBR), turns part of an inflated sphere into a parabolic antenna. With funding from NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program, Walker was able to develop and demonstrate a 33-foot-diameter LBR. The LBR is lightweight and can be folded into a small volume, making it more practical for space missions compared to traditional large reflector antennas. The technology has been tested aboard a stratospheric balloon and is now being prepared for a high-speed communications demonstration in low Earth orbit. Future missions to the Moon and deep space using CubeSats equipped with inflatable antennas are also being explored.

 This article describes a childhood memory of the author visiting the Huntsville Space Museum in Huntsville, Alabama. The museum featured a demonstration involving a large pie pan with Mylar stretched across it, supported by a tripod. At the top of the pan was a cone of metal, inside of which was a copper tube that spiraled around the cone and connected to the tripod legs. A household vacuum cleaner was attached to the bottom of the pan to create a suction effect, causing the Mylar to form a parabolic surface when turned on. The sunshine was then focused into the cone, and water was run through the copper tube, eventually turning into steam. The author has fond memories of this contraption.

 The article argues that TCP is outdated and UDP-based protocols, like QUIC, are a better option. The author highlights that TCP connections take longer to establish due to TLS encryption, and that TCP connections do not survive changes in IP addresses. The author also criticizes the stream model of TCP for transmitting data and suggests that reassembling packets on the receiver side would be more efficient. However, the author acknowledges the risks involved in creating custom UDP protocols.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an alternative protocol called uTP used in BitTorrent that avoids amplification attacks through a three-way handshake. The protocol automatically throttles itself to prioritize TCP connections when necessary. The author ponders why UDP is used instead of TCP for this purpose and suggests that a protocol-level solution could be implemented. One possibility is that uTP is designed to throttle both sends and receives and requires tracking throttle information for each peer. However, the article does not provide a definitive answer for the choice of UDP over TCP.

## 10. [Scientists simulate backward time travel using quantum entanglement](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38045112)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Scientists from Cambridge University have successfully simulated a method of backward time travel using the properties of quantum entanglement. They were able to change the outcome of an experiment after it had already occurred by manipulating the entanglement of two particles. The researchers emphasize that this does not violate the laws of physics. However, their simulation only achieved the desired result 25% of the time, with the remaining 75% resulting in different outcomes. The team suggests using a filter system to improve the success rate of backward time travel. They note that while their simulations are successful, they are not proposing a time travel machine, but rather exploring the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. The researchers believe that the failure rate of their system is reassuring and consistent with Einstein's theories of relativity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a metrology experiment where the input state can be amended by simulating a closed timelike curve, which is a hypothetical worldline that travels backward in time. The researchers use quantum-teleportation circuits to simulate these curves probabilistically. The experiment shows that entanglement can provide a nonclassical advantage in terms of gaining information. The goal of the experiment is for a metrologist to prepare probes for an unknown quantum interaction and infer as much information as possible per probe. The metrologist can manipulate entanglement to effectively teleport the optimal input back in time, although this method sometimes fails. Overall, the experiment demonstrates that entanglement can produce advantages that are not allowed in classical theories respecting chronology.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the research findings indicate an unusual level of accuracy, which could potentially be attributed to time travel. However, the authors acknowledge that the notion of causality does not fit in this context. It is important to note that there is currently no way to discuss entanglement involving time prior to entanglement or any substantial manipulation of entangled particles. Even if it were possible to communicate backwards in time with an entangled particle, it would likely not have a significant impact at distances within the range of the speed of light.
