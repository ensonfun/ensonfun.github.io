## 3. [Interactive intro to shaders](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38032288)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 This article is about shaders, which are small programs that run on your GPU to create graphics. The author wanted to learn about shaders and decided to replace a simple CSS animation on their website with a shader-based animation. Shaders are powerful because they can work on multiple pixels at the same time, making them very efficient. Shaders have to be low-level and compact, and they transform pixel coordinates into colors. The article explains how to create simple shaders, such as gradients and shapes, using functions like step() and smoothstep(). It also introduces Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and explains how to create shapes using SDFs and boolean operations. The article concludes with an example of how to add interactivity to a shader by allowing the user to control the position of a ball within the animation using their mouse. Overall, the article provides a beginner-friendly introduction to shaders and offers resources for further learning.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article has decided to share their journey of learning shaders with others on the internet, despite their initial hesitation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article points out a minor mistake in spelling the term "cel shading" as "cell shading." The term "cel shading" actually originated from the use of "cels" in hand-drawn animations and the quantized tones used in shading.

## 6. [Now add a walrus: Prompt engineering in DALL-E 3](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38031839)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experiences with DALL-E 3, OpenAI's image generation model. They explore the capabilities of the model by using prompts through ChatGPT to generate different images. The author discovers that they can maintain consistency between images by adding extra details to the prompt and using the same seed. They also uncover a leaked prompt that reveals some of the prompt engineering strategies used by OpenAI. Overall, the article provides insights into the capabilities and prompt engineering techniques of DALL-E 3.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses observations about the behavior of ChatGPT and Dall-E, two AI models developed by OpenAI. One point of interest is that ChatGPT seems to prompt Dall-E via the client instead of keeping the interaction server-side, which could potentially lead to information leakage and tampering. The article also notes that the issue with Dall-E 3 seeds has been fixed recently, as they were not working properly before. The author speculates that the lack of consistency in generated images given the same seed and slightly altered prompt could be due to the poor prompt adherence of another model called Midjourney. The article provides an example showing how the images generated by Dall-E are not dramatically different using a specific prompt.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explains that people have been trying to find ways to create consistent characters using Midjourney. The author suggests that DALL-E 3 has the ability to do this as an undocumented feature, by reusing the seed. However, using a constant seed to generate similar images has limitations, as it cannot maintain character consistency across different poses.

## 10. [How to catch a wild triangle](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38034269)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article explains the process that Kaspersky went through to investigate and analyze an ongoing attack targeting iPhones and iPads. They noticed suspicious network activity and initiated a digital forensics and incident response protocol to locate and extract the malware. They inspected the devices, used iTunes backups as a substitute for complete device images, and built a timeline of events using the Mobile Verification Toolkit. They discovered indicators of compromise, attempted to intercept iMessages, and decrypted HTTPS communications with the command-and-control servers. Through various methods, they were able to obtain the payload, decrypt the data, and extract the implant and its modules, including four zero-day exploits. The investigation involved multiple techniques and extensive research on iOS internals.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a devlog detailing a security exploit that involves a .watchface file sent over iMessage. This file is used to gain power and delete all records of the iMessage, enabling two-way encrypted communications with a local binary. The discovery of this exploit led to multiple zero-day reports to Apple, as well as the creation of a MITM proxy poisoner to compromise encryption used by the exploit server's communications channel. The article mentions the potential paranoia of Kaspersky, implying that there may be threats targeting them.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that there has been a recent attack on the cybersecurity company Kaspersky. It is believed that the attack involved the use of four previously unknown vulnerabilities, known as zero-day exploits, which were reported to Apple. The article speculates that the National Security Agency (NSA) may be behind the attack, possibly in response to Kaspersky's exposure of the STUXNET malware in the past. Another possibility mentioned is that Israel and Unit 8200 may be involved. Overall, the attack is considered to be costly for Kaspersky due to the loss of the zero-day exploits.
