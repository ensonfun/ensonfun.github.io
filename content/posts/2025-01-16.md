## 1. [No Calls](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725385)

**Total comment counts : 87**

### Summary

 Zeke Gabrielse, the founder of Keygen, initially set up his company with a strict "no calls" policy due to his aversion to sales calls as an introvert. He found calls inefficient and awkward, particularly when trying to engage with larger, enterprise-level customers. Initially, he attempted to facilitate sales by adding a 'book a call' button on his pricing page, but this strategy was unsuccessful and frustrating. 

Realizing the inefficiencies, Gabrielse removed the call option and instead directed potential clients to communicate via email. This shift led to more direct interactions with the right stakeholders within potential client organizations, bypassing unnecessary layers of bureaucracy. This approach not only resulted in closing his first enterprise deal with an F1000 company but also proved effective with subsequent clients, validating his method of avoiding calls.

Gabrielse attributes the success of his no-call policy to solving common issues that typically necessitate calls in enterprise sales:

1. **Clear Messaging**: By ensuring his product's value proposition is clear and targeted, he reduces the need for calls to clarify what the product does.
2. **Focused Product Offering**: A narrow product focus eliminates the need for lengthy discussions to determine fit.

He believes that while he might be leaving some money on the table by not offering extensive customer support or consulting, this strategy aligns with his vision for Keygen, allowing him to focus on work he enjoys and avoid what he dislikes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the frustrations of a CTO with the sales tactics of software companies, particularly the requirement for calls before providing sufficient product information. Here are the key points:

1. **Information Availability**: The CTO prefers to have detailed product information readily available online. Without this, he will either find substitutes or develop in-house solutions.

2. **Product Fit and Pricing**: He needs to know if the product generally meets his needs and if the pricing is reasonable before considering further engagement.

3. **Efficiency of Sales Calls**: While calls are acceptable for discussing detailed needs, they should be efficient, avoiding unnecessary introductions or small talk. The CTO values his time and expects sales interactions to respect that.

4. **Preparation by Sales**: He appreciates when salespeople do preliminary research on his company, which can make interactions more productive by reducing the need for basic information gathering during calls.

5. **Role of Calls**: Calls should be used to delve into specifics after the potential customer has a basic understanding of the product's fit for their needs.

In essence, the CTO advocates for a sales process that respects the customer's time and provides clear, upfront information to facilitate decision-making.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the differences in sales strategies based on the nature of business-to-business (B2B) products and their market positioning:

- **Inbound vs. Outbound Sales**: For businesses focusing on content marketing or ads, inbound sales work well. However, for enterprise B2B companies aiming for rapid growth, outbound sales are recommended.

- **Product Complexity and Pricing**: The example given involves a solopreneur with a product priced up to $72k/year, but typically dealing with much smaller deals. This approach suits products with lower Annual Contract Value (ACV) where the cost and effort of sales calls for small deals aren't scalable.

- **Strategy Suitability**: The article points out that the discussed strategy is ideal for scaling products with lower ACV, which require a broad market demand. However, for products with higher ACV, which are typically more complex and command higher prices, different sales strategies would be more effective. 

In summary, the choice between inbound and outbound sales strategies in B2B markets heavily depends on the product's complexity, pricing, and the scale of typical deals.

RSS, however, allows users to subscribe to content directly from sources they trust without the manipulative algorithms.

2. **Benefits of RSS**: RSS feeds enable users to:
   - Access content without ads or algorithmic manipulation.
   - Filter content based on specific criteria like keywords or minimum engagement metrics.
   - Avoid the noise of irrelevant posts, focusing only on content of interest.

3. **How to Use RSS**: 
   - **Getting Started**: You can use open-source RSS readers like Tiny Tiny RSS, which can be self-hosted or accessed through various online services. 
   - **Subscribing to Feeds**: 
     - For straightforward websites like YouTube, simply use the channel URL.
     - For sites like IGN, you might need to find the RSS feed URL manually or through a dedicated RSS page.
     - For complex sites like HackerNews, third-party services can filter content for you before it reaches your RSS reader.

4. **Tips for RSS Usage**: 
   - Websites might not advertise their RSS support, but appending `.rss` or `atom.xml` to URLs can often reveal feeds.
   - Middleman services can enhance RSS feeds with additional filtering capabilities, especially useful for sites where direct RSS feeds are too broad or unfiltered.

5. **Personal Example**: The author mentions managing their interest in homelabs via Reddit but uses RSS to filter out unwanted content like memes and repetitive hardware setup pictures, ensuring they only see posts with significant engagement or relevance.

In summary, RSS is presented as a tool to reclaim attention span and efficiently consume high-quality content from the internet, offering a personalized and less manipulative alternative to traditional social media platforms.
