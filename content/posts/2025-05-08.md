## 1. [How linear regression works intuitively and how it leads to gradient descent](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43895890)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article explains how linear regression predicts house prices based on size, establishing a relationship between the explanatory variable (size) and the predicted price through a formula characterized by a slope and intercept. It emphasizes the importance of finding the best-fitting line by minimizing errors between predicted and actual prices. The method of absolute error is discussed as a means to measure these discrepancies, with the goal of finding the line that yields the smallest total error, thus refining guesses to achieve optimal pricing for homes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses a desire to improve their understanding of statistics, particularly regarding linear regression. They clarify that the discussion focuses on the preference for squared distances in regression rather than absolute distances, questioning why absolute distances yield multiple results. The author notes the limitations of regression analysis, using house prices as an example, and emphasizes the need for additional information, like standard deviation. They also suggest that relying solely on squared distances could oversimplify data, potentially omitting valuable insights.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Least squares regression predicts the conditional mean of a target variable based on given variables. This concept can extend to predicting conditional medians and other quantiles, which are more robust to outliers. For instance, using absolute loss can yield conditional median predictions, making it a better choice in datasets with outliers. Although absolute loss has its drawbacks, it offers advantages over least squares, highlighting the trade-offs involved in regression methods.

## 3. [Inheritance was invented as a performance hack (2021)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43903705)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article explores the invention of inheritance in the Simula programming language, motivated by the need for simpler garbage collection and efficient data structures. Simula opted for reference counting over composition to simplify its garbage collector, leading to limitations like banning call by name parameters. This restrictiveness prompted the need for inheritance to allow for class customization. Furthermore, Simula transitioned from traditional linked lists to intrusive lists for better memory efficiency, which necessitated the development of the inheritance mechanism. Thus, inheritance became a crucial feature to address the limitations posed by earlier design choices.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author questions the effectiveness of inheritance in programming, arguing that it unnecessarily intertwines constructors, data storage, and interfaces without clear advantages. Inheritance implies a tree structure for organizing interfaces, but this often fails to represent real-world scenarios accurately, leading to problems in edge cases. The author suggests that inheritance might be more of a performance hack than a well-considered design principle.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of inheritance in programming, originally developed as a performance optimization technique. It references two discussions from Hacker News, one from April 2021 with 252 comments and another from March 2023 with a single comment, reflecting ongoing interest and debate surrounding the topic.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In Korea, some students drop out of high school to focus on preparing for the national exam at cram schools (hagwon), which can improve their chances of university admission based solely on test results. Parents believe this allows their children to concentrate on exam preparation rather than engaging in what they regard as unimportant subjects. This trend is concerning as it reduces schools to mere gateways to higher education, neglecting their broader educational purpose.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article critiques the over-the-top portrayal of a mathematician, suggesting it relies on clichéd narratives that exaggerate his achievements. Although he has an artistic background and briefly considered poetry, he ultimately pursued mathematics due to his parents' influence. The author notes that he displays typical neurodivergent traits associated with ADHD or autism and expresses a desire for journalists to similarly elevate actual artists like poets and sculptors.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 High-resolution mass spectrometers, essential for reliable diagnoses, are extremely expensive, often costing millions, which limits accessibility for many hospitals. A single spectrometer may only process three samples per hour, falling short of the 72 bacterial swabs generated by smaller hospitals each hour. While research universities can afford such equipment, smaller facilities cannot invest in multiple spectrometers and technicians. In contrast, standard bacterial cultures remain a cost-effective alternative.
