## 1. [RFC 35140: HTTP Do-Not-Stab (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42232040)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The article discusses a fictional HTTP header named "Do-Not-Stab," which humorously proposes a way for users to communicate their preference against being stabbed by websites, reflecting a satirical take on user privacy and consent in digital interactions. Here are the key points:

1. **Purpose**: The header aims to allow users to express their discomfort with being "stabbed" (a metaphor for unwanted actions by websites) through a simple HTTP header setting.

2. **Implementation**: The header's syntax is straightforward with only one value, `Do-Not-Stab: 1`, indicating a user's preference not to be stabbed. Its absence implies consent to being stabbed.

3. **Compliance**: While the header suggests a way for users to opt-out of stabbings, it notes that bad actors might ignore it. However, most stabbings are portrayed as being done by law-abiding companies who would comply if asked.

4. **Geographical Limitations**: Microsoft's commitment to support this header is limited to the European Economic Area (EEA), reflecting real-world compliance with regulations like the Digital Markets Act only where legally required.

5. **Critique of Corporate Behavior**: The article critiques companies for only following regulations to the bare minimum required by law, highlighting a broader commentary on corporate ethics, privacy, and user consent in the digital age.

6. **Humor and Satire**: The entire concept uses dark humor to critique the state of privacy, consent, and corporate responsibility online, with the absurdity of needing to explicitly tell companies not to do harmful actions.

This article uses the fictional "Do-Not-Stab" header as a lens to discuss and satirize real issues surrounding user privacy, consent, and corporate compliance with regulations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the shift in responsibility for personal data protection from institutions and regulators to individual users. It critiques the ineffectiveness of voluntary compliance measures like "Do-Not-Stab" or "Do-Not-Track" in the face of financial incentives for companies to ignore such requests. The author suggests a need for a societal pushback, advocating for a more aggressive and confrontational approach to protect personal autonomy in using technology.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the deprecation of the "Do-Not-Stab" header in web browsers, which was initially designed to prevent users from being metaphorically "stabbed" by websites, but was turned off by default due to economic impacts on the "stabbing industry." A new, non-standard header called General Assault Control (Sec-GAC) has been introduced, which can be set to 1 to request that websites refrain from assaultive actions. However, due to legal restrictions in places like Colorado, this feature must be explicitly enabled by users, protecting local industries that benefit from such virtual interactions. The article also mentions that while there's a push for browsers to support this new header, its adoption remains low, potentially allowing non-compliant websites to target users more accurately or even harm them virtually. Users can check for website compliance by requesting a JSON file, but this could result in retaliatory actions from non-compliant servers.

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article explores the dynamic nature of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) table, focusing on short-term fluctuations rather than long-term trends. Here are the key points:

1. **Background and Motivation**: While much research focuses on long-term trends like BGP table growth or IPv6 adoption, the author aims to analyze daily changes in the BGP table to understand the immediate, real-time challenges routers face in maintaining internet routing.

2. **Data Collection**: The author uses a tool named `bgpsee`, a BGP daemon developed to parse BGP messages into JSON format, capturing a dataset from June 1 to July 1, 2024, which includes over 464,000 BGP UPDATE messages.

3. **Analysis of BGP Updates**: 
   - **First Tranche**: Upon establishing a BGP peering session, there's an initial large dump of updates, termed the 'first tranche', which includes all existing paths and routes in the BGP table. This tranche showed 949,483 routes across various paths.
   - **Subsequent Updates**: After the first tranche, updates are sent every 30 seconds, reflecting changes or withdrawals of routes. The article examines the number of path updates per interval for both IPv4 and IPv6.

4. **Patterns and Observations**:
   - The average number of updates every 30 seconds was around 50 for IPv4 and slightly less for IPv6, with significant variance in update frequency.
   - The article quantifies changes in IP address space using logarithmic transformations to understand the scale of routing changes over time.
   - A cyclic pattern was observed in IPv4 updates, suggesting some regular behavior in routing changes, which was further analyzed using autocorrelation.

5. **Conclusion**: The exploration raises more questions than it answers, typical of exploratory data analysis, indicating areas for further research or improvement in BGP management and understanding.

Overall, the article provides insights into the real-time dynamics of BGP routing, highlighting the complexity and the constant flux in internet routing tables, and encourages further study into the patterns and anomalies within these updates.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article recounts the author's experience 25 years ago when they worked for a small Internet Service Provider (ISP). Initially, the ISP had only one upstream provider. The author's task was to enable multihoming for the ISP, which involves connecting to multiple upstream ISPs to improve redundancy and reliability. They utilized tutorials by Avi Freedman, which were crucial in simplifying the complex process of setting up BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing. With Freedman's guidance, the author successfully obtained a /20 IP block from ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) and established connections with two different peers, enhancing the ISP's network capabilities. The experience left the author in awe of how the internet's routing system functions.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses issues related to BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) route management:

1. **Route Dampening**: The author notes that the flapping (frequent changes) of a particular IP prefix (EpicUp 140.99.244.0/23) should have been mitigated through route dampening, a technique used by ISPs to limit the impact of unstable routes on the global routing table.

2. **Correlation and Patterns**: The author is skeptical about the causality between BGP updates and the effects suggested by another study, arguing that basing route advertisements on paths to other autonomous systems, especially unstable ones, would be inefficient. 

3. **Periodicity**: The author doubts the existence of a 40-minute periodicity in BGP updates, suggesting that what might be observed could be coincidental or specific to the dataset or network from which the BGP feed was obtained.

4. **Data Analysis**: Upon closer examination of BGP update data, the author suggests that changes are scattered across various Autonomous Systems (AS) without a clear overarching pattern, indicating typical daily noise in BGP updates due to various operational reasons like maintenance or new configurations.

5. **Global Impact and Management**: The article highlights the global nature of BGP where even local issues (like a backhoe cutting a fiber line in Kansas) can affect routing worldwide. However, ISPs manage to keep the frequency of updates under control through various policies, maintaining global routing stability despite these local disturbances. 

Overall, the article provides a critical look at how BGP updates are managed, the skepticism regarding patterns in BGP behavior, and acknowledges the complex, interconnected nature of internet routing.

## 9. [OCaml Syntax Sucks (2016)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182620)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 The article discusses the complexities and confusions surrounding the `let ... = ... in ...` syntax in OCaml:

1. **Confusion with Nesting**: Nested `let` expressions can be hard to read because there's no clear visual indicator of scope, making it difficult to understand the nesting structure.

2. **Syntax Overlap**: The same syntax is used for both global and local declarations, and also for function definitions, which adds to the confusion. This is consistent in the sense that a function with no arguments (arity 0) and no side effects acts like a constant, but it still contributes to readability issues.

3. **Historical Context**: OCaml's syntax evolved from ML, which was influenced by ISWIM, an ideal language designed to influence future programming languages with a syntax that mixed English and mathematical notation.

4. **Comparison with Other Languages**:
   - **ML** uses an `end` to indicate the end of a scope, which provides some clarity but at the cost of additional typing.
   - **LISP** and **C-style syntax** are mentioned as alternatives where syntax might be less ambiguous or more conventional.

5. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Keeping the ML/OCaml style might require clearer syntax for `let` expressions, though suggestions are not provided in the article.
   - Alternatively, adopting a different syntax paradigm like that of LISP or C could simplify understanding due to more conventional or explicit scoping rules.

6. **Modern Developments**: The article notes that ReasonML by Facebook attempts to address some of these issues by providing OCaml with a JavaScript-like syntax.

The article concludes that while there are inherent issues with the `let` syntax in OCaml, its lineage and the attempt to mimic natural language have led to its unique, if sometimes confusing, structure.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses criticisms of OCaml's syntax, particularly focusing on:

1. **Lack of End Markers for Let-Bindings**: The author of the critique believes that the absence of markers to signify the end of let scopes in OCaml's syntax can be confusing.

2. **Uniform Syntax for Functions and Constants**: The same syntax used for binding functions and constants is another point of contention, though the article's author finds this less problematic in practice, especially with good code formatting.

The article also mentions a more significant issue with OCaml:

- **Pattern Matching**: The lack of terminators for matches often leads to errors in nested matches, compounded by poor error reporting from the parser, making debugging and coding more challenging.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's appreciation for OCaml, highlighting several ergonomic and structural features of the language:

1. **Syntax and Ergonomics**: OCaml's syntax is praised for being whitespace-insensitive, which aids in code formatting, and for having fewer punctuation characters than other languages, enhancing typing ease.

2. **Scope and Variable Definition**: The language's scoping rules make it straightforward to locate variable definitions by simply looking upwards in the code, except when the "open" keyword complicates this.

3. **Language Simplicity**: OCaml's core is simple with only three fundamental components - values, types, and modules, which all fit into a clear hierarchy.

4. **Nested Let Bindings**: These allow for the localization of variable scope, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

5. **Compilation**: OCaml boasts a fast compiler with separate compilation capabilities, leading to a very quick development cycle.

6. **Practicality**: While the language encourages good coding practices, it also provides easy access to less conventional programming techniques when needed.

7. **Compiler Restrictions**: Certain restrictions like the value restriction are in place to prevent common errors, while also enabling features like local mutation.
