## 1. [Reverse-engineering my speakers' API to get reasonable volume control](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41069606)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with new powered speakers that have built-in streaming service integrations. The speakers are louder than necessary, making it challenging to make small volume adjustments within safe levels for the apartment. To solve this issue, the author plans to build a custom volume knob that provides more precise control within their preferred listening range. The author explores the speakers' web interface and discovers a straightforward HTTP API that allows them to adjust the volume. They also attempt to change the maximum volume setting but encounter difficulties. As a temporary solution, the author creates a web page with a slider for volume control. They encounter CORS issues when sending requests to the speakers and ultimately build a small web server using Bun to forward requests. The author expresses a desire for a physical volume knob that can be conveniently placed in their apartment.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

However, they mention that they are no longer actively working on it or accepting issues as they do not work in Ruby often.

## 7. [Bril: An Intermediate Language for Teaching Compilers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41084318)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses the creation and use of Bril, the Big Red Intermediate Language, as a tool for teaching compilers. The author wanted a hands-on approach where students could implement algorithms and encounter bugs with real programs. Bril is designed to prioritize teaching goals over code size, compiler speed, and performance. It is an instruction-based, assembly-like, typed, and ANF language. Bril programs are JSON documents, but there is also a text form for convenience. The language has certain design decisions that reflect its focus on education, such as including a print opcode and enforcing A-normal form for constants. Bril is extensible, allowing for the addition of new opcodes and data types. It does not require SSA (Static Single Assignment) and instead uses mutable variables, which simplifies teaching but has caused difficulties with undefinedness and correctness.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article suggests that Bril's SSA form needs to be reworked, possibly by extending the language similar to MLIR's basic block arguments. The author mentions that Swift is credited for this idea, but the earliest example of phis as continuation arguments is found in MLton. The author expresses curiosity about the origin of this idea and states that standard phis are difficult to work with.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses the concept of ANF (Administrative Normal Form) in the context of programming languages. ANF is a property of operands being atomic, which is common in many intermediate representations (IRs). However, the author argues that simply having atomic operands is not enough to label a language as "an ANF language." The original ANF allows anonymous functions as arguments, but a variant without this feature is more commonly referred to. The author also explains that ANF is closely associated with functional compiler space and is often used in tree-like structures with nested functions and join points. The article emphasizes the need for precise definitions and properties of IRs to differentiate them, rather than assuming that everyone understands the term "an ANF language".

## 8. [Europe is in danger of regulating its tech market out of existence](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41081238)

**Total comment counts : 78**

### Summary

 The article discusses how European regulations, such as the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), are causing tech companies like Apple to withhold certain products and features from European users. The author argues that these regulations are leading to anti-competitive behavior and pushing tech companies towards "exit" rather than trying to negotiate or comply with the regulations. The article mentions other examples of tech companies blocking features or services in specific countries due to regulatory concerns. The author suggests that Europe's regulatory approach could lead to a fragmented tech landscape where international tech giants choose to withdraw from the European market.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the regulatory challenges faced by companies in the telecommunications industry, highlighting the reasons behind these regulations. It mentions that companies in this industry have to navigate through a complex web of legal requirements due to past attempts at monopolization and instances of harm caused by some companies. While large tech companies haven't directly caused harm like tobacco or talc powder, they are consistently trying to squash competition and collect personal data for profit. The article also suggests that these companies take advantage of the relatively lax regulatory environment compared to physical stores or pre-existing industries.

He suggests that there is a need to reevaluate the approach to software development and prioritize simplicity and efficiency.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of companies like Tailscale, Cloudflare, and Google solving problems with the modern internet that should have been designed to solve themselves. It argues that these companies have a vested interest in keeping the problem alive because it is essential for their business. The internet needs a solution like IPv6 with automatic encryption via IPsec and PKI provided by DNSSEC, but companies like Tailscale have incentives to prevent widespread and compatible implementation of such solutions.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses concerns about centralized control and rent-seeking behaviors. It briefly touches on the debate about the relevance of client-server computing and its relationship to rent-seeking. Ultimately, the article concludes that there will be a division between those who have access to certain technologies and those who do not. It compares this to past advancements, such as the availability of mainframes and the internet, and suggests that in the future, access to technologies like Tailscale will determine one's ability to use certain applications.
