## 1. [The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46579864)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 macOS Tahoe’s oversized window corners are a usability issue. Resizing relies on a 19×19-pixel hit area at the corner, but Tahoe’s large radius leaves about 75% of that area outside the window (only ~25% inside, vs 62% inside without rounding). As a result, initial clicks near the corner often don’t resize, forcing users to grab outside the corner—an unnatural, error-prone gesture. In short, the aesthetic choice hinders usability by making the expected resize action unintuitive.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The Tahoe/macOS update is a wide-scale UX misstep with non-intuitive window management and numerous bugs, prompting strong user backlash.
- Concern: If these issues persist, they could degrade productivity and push users to seek alternatives or alternatives OS, while Apple may appear unresponsive to feedback.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from harsh criticism and nostalgia for traditional Mac UX to cautious optimism that Apple or future updates (e.g., Dye replacement) could restore usability, with some considering not upgrading or switching to Linux/other solutions.
- Overall sentiment: Highly critical

## 2. [iCloud Photos Downloader](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46578921)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 iCloud Photos Downloader (icloudpd) is a command-line tool to download photos from iCloud. The project emphasizes feedback and documentation, with weekly Friday releases if improvements warrant. To work, your iCloud account must be configured correctly to avoid ACCESS_DENIED from Apple servers; there are three run methods (see docs). Some features start in experimental mode before joining the main package. The tool keeps your iCloud photos synchronized locally; synchronization can be adjusted with CLI options. Run icloudpd --help for full options, and you can create/authorize a session (2SA/2FA) to verify authentication. Contributions welcome via guidelines.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on options to back up or export iCloud Photos outside Apple's ecosystem using tools like icloudpd, Parachute Backup, and self-hosted workflows.  
- Concern: The main worry is that non-Apple solutions can introduce privacy risks, reliability issues, or lossy exports that degrade edits or formats (e.g., Live Photos).  
- Perspectives: Participants range from enthusiastic adoption of third-party backups and cross-device syncing to frustration with Apple’s restrictions and a desire for open, interoperable solutions.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 3. [Sampling at negative temperature](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46579374)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Inspired by temperature in mechanics, the article tests negative-temperature sampling for LLaMA. Temperature shapes token probabilities via Boltzmann-like distribution; in nets, softmax defines probabilities. A negative T flips the exponent, making previously unlikely tokens most likely, which only makes sense in finite models like a neural net’s layer. OpenAI limits temperatures to 0–2, so the author runs LLaMA with llama.cpp and --temperature -0.001. At T=0.001 the model outputs normal text; at -0.001 the output is weird, sometimes hanging and producing chaotic multilingual text. LLaMA-13B shows longer, nonsensical sequences. Conclusion: negative temperature yields bizarre outputs, exposing sampling fragility in finite models.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on exploring temperature-based sampling for LLMs, including negative temperatures and dynamic adjustments, as a way to understand and potentially improve model behavior.
- Concern: There is worry that these ideas may misinterpret temperature concepts, produce unstable or meaningless outputs, and amount to hype or gimmicks without clear practical benefits.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic, engineering-focused experimentation and potential sampling tricks to skepticism about the physical meaning and real-world usefulness, plus concerns about noise and evaluation.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 5. [A set of Idiomatic prod-grade katas for experienced devs transitioning to Go](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46531622)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 This article promotes a repository of Daily Katas—short, focused Go challenges designed to ingrain idiomatic patterns through repetitive practice. It stresses that the aim is not broad Go instruction but to drill production-grade techniques: safe concurrency, memory efficiency, backpressure and cancellation, idiomatic HTTP patterns, robust error handling, portable binaries, testable filesystem code, and quality testing practices (table-driven tests, fuzzing). It also encourages leveraging lessons from experienced developers, consulting the CONTRIBUTING file, and using daily drills to apply Go the Go way; page-load errors are noted.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A Go-focused repository uses constraint-driven katas to help developers transitioning to Go practice idiomatic usage and reconciling production realities, not just syntax tutorials.
- Concern: There are doubts about the project's usefulness and authenticity, including an AI-generated vibe, very little code, no license, and a lack of solutions.
- Perspectives: Some welcome the production-oriented practice approach and encourage feedback, while others criticize the lack of code, licensing, and concrete solutions.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. ["Scholars Will Call It Nonsense": The Structure of von Däniken's Argument (1987)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46578957)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 Epstein analyzes the structure of von Däniken’s Chariots of the Gods? rather than its evidence. He notes the book’s huge sales and the public’s readiness to accept a narrative in which extraterrestrials shaped human history and intelligence. Epstein argues the argument rests on a flood of assertions presented as proof, producing much ‘smoke’ that blurs the lack of solid evidence. Individual refutations (such as supposed site-wide kinship or odd artifacts) can be mounted, yet the broader swamp remains; thus, a different line of attack is needed beyond debunking single claims.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion weighs Erich von Däniken's ancient-astronaut ideas—his cultural impact, appeal to imagination, and the criticisms of their scientific validity.
- Concern: There is worry that belief in ancient aliens persists for emotional or spiritual reasons rather than evidence, potentially misinforming people and undermining scientific literacy.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from seeing his work as imaginative entertainment and a spark for exploration, to criticizing it as pseudoscience and noting earlier precedents, with some treating it as a harmless hobby.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [Ask HN: What are you working on? (January 2026)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46577242)

**Total comment counts : 265**

### Summary

 Linux printing remains a 20+ year old stack (CUPS) with multiple driver architectures and four rasterizers, all riddled with bugs. Maintenance is sparse: four people on printing (two since CUPS’s 1999 start) and one on scanning. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS will be the last with CUPS v2; CUPS v3 will drop current driver architectures and introduce modern driverless printing via a wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers already use the wrapper, but proprietary drivers may not work out of the box, causing user disruption. OpenPrinting invites involvement (GitHub link).

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: A comprehensive, multi-topic update from a developer criticizing the aging Linux printing stack and documenting a wide range of personal tech projects and experiments
- Concern: The upcoming CUPS v3 could drop the current printer driver architecture and require driverless printing, risking widespread user disruption and breaking proprietary drivers
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from alarm about legacy compatibility and maintainer burden to optimism about modernization and a strong desire to share and contribute to open-source projects
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
