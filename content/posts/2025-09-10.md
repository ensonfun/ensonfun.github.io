 This piece warns that a dangerous technology, such as MCP, could be misused as many will ignore warnings or fail to grasp the full risks. It argues that most people experimenting with MCP don’t understand how prompt injection attacks work or why they pose a significant threat.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 An article argues that agentic AI has been weaponized, with AI models now conducting sophisticated cyberattacks instead of merely giving guidance, and calls for regulation to mitigate these risks. It also condemns AI companies for pushing features that grant AI full executable access to users’ personal data.

## 2. [Show HN: Term.everything – Run any GUI app in the terminal](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45181535)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 The article introduces term.everything❗, a from-scratch Wayland-based Linux CLI program that renders GUI windows inside a terminal instead of a monitor. It enables running GUI apps in the terminal, with examples like gaming and SSH-based browsing. Window quality is limited by terminal size; increasing resolution can improve visuals but may reduce performance, and some terminals can render images at full resolution. Built in TypeScript (bun) with some C++, it offers a beta download, HowIDidIt.md explanations, and contributor guidelines.

## 3. [Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200925)

**Total comment counts : 14**

### Summary

 Reproducibility is foundational yet hard for large language models. Even with temperature 0 (greedy sampling), LLM APIs and OSS backends can yield non-identical results. A common blame is concurrency plus floating-point non-associativity, but that hypothesis misses the full picture. The article argues the true culprit is floating-point non-associativity itself. Floating-point numbers maintain precision only approximately, and adding values with different exponents can lose information, causing results to depend on order. Since different execution orders arise with parallel hardware, outputs vary. The piece promises to explain how to defeat nondeterminism and achieve true reproducibility.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that fixing theoretical nondeterminism for a fully closed input-output pair doesn’t address two practical problems: context-dependent results for the same input and brittle results when inputs are slightly transformed. Without solving these, closed-system nondeterminism is mainly useful only for simple lookup scenarios. It also warns that you can’t rely on “correct” unit tests or evaluation sets to prove correctness for inputs you haven’t tested.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece praises high-quality, blog-style research discussions, noting Anthropic is leading this trend and that it’s spreading, with OpenAI having done similar work during RL research days.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author argues that many AI products solve the wrong problems. They praise the product as cool and potentially useful, but warn that if you think you need it, your organization likely has bigger issues, since PRs would be the last thing they'd want an AI intern to manage.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author, increasingly working with AI, says they have little patience for AI-generated content, viewing it as a waste of time regardless of accuracy. They note meeting summaries are often ignored and code is auto-generated for prototypes, with formal reviews reserved for serious work. They prefer AI for producing content, not consuming it.

## 6. [Launch HN: Recall.ai (YC W20) – API for meeting recordings and transcripts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45199648)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 Recall.ai offers a Desktop Recording SDK to enable reliable, scalable meeting recording in desktop apps, handling video, audio, real-time data, and in-meeting UI challenges. Previously, they provided an API to insert a bot into meetings to access streams; desktop recording is now popular but hard due to speaker-name capture, screen-scraping UI changes, video cropping, and performance. With 2,000+ customers (e.g., HubSpot, ClickUp), the team solved severe engineering issues (1-in-36M segfaults, Postgres locks) and saved $1M/year on AWS. Pricing starts at $0.70/hour; data belongs to customers; 0-day retention; no model training on their data; free credits.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Congratulates the launch and praises Amanda’s LinkedIn presence, but argues Recall.ai’s product may be at risk due to open-source transcription models (Whisper, DistilWhisper, TinyLlama, miniGPT-4, OpenHermes, Vosk, Llama.cpp). It suggests that in a weekend one could assemble an open-source stack to rival or surpass Recall.ai’s value, and questions whether this concern is exaggerated.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article questions the rationale for distributing a physical mailer to a large portion of San Francisco and why the mailing contains so little information on the page.

## 7. [OrioleDB Patent: now freely available to the Postgres community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45196173)

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reviews a patent and its code, arguing that nearly all cited research derives from prior work by many scientists. They contend good intentions don’t justify theft, since inviting others to use stolen work still makes you a thief. They warn that obtaining a USPTO patent stamp does not prove invention, only bureaucratic approval to claim others’ work. To be on the side of the good guys, they urge burning the patent and apologizing to the research community.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Blog contrasts a patent clause designed as a shield for open source against hostile IP claims with a license that terminates if any litigation is filed by a licensee against Supabase. The author argues the termination clause could deter state entities, since even minor lawsuits (like a tax delay) might end the license. The piece suggests a narrower, patent-focused restriction or adopting an OSI-approved license as better alternatives.

## 8. [I didn't bring my son to a museum to look at screens](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45199931)

**Total comment counts : 50**

### Summary

 The author fondly recalls growing up at The Franklin Institute, where hands-on, interactive exhibits left a lasting impression. A recent family visit with their six-year-old revealed a disappointing shift toward screens and video games, especially in Wondrous Space and Body Odyssey, with motion-sensor experiences replacing tangible artifacts. While some rooms like Sir Isaac’s Loft and Air Show still offer tactile learning, many physical exhibits are poorly maintained or worn, and some devices don’t work well. The piece laments the screen-dominated approach and advocates for more durable, engaging, hands-on experiences.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 An ex-startup founder explains museum challenges: money is scarce, museums rely on donations or patrons and incur high costs for climate control and lighting. Curators often prioritise preservation over displaying and may lack digital expertise. Public tenders create bureaucratic delays and poor results, sometimes favoring unsuitable firms. The author dislikes exhibits that are merely glass cases with little explanation and prefers multimedia explanations (audio/video in multiple languages); 3D-printed replicas can be valuable in some cases.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The piece argues that public-facing institutions feel pressured to embrace digital technology even when it’s unwarranted. In education, schools push IT for prestige, even listing AI as the basic CS topic for younger students. It notes Scandinavia’s trend of removing devices from classrooms as a counter-example. The pressure extends to museums, where screens are ubiquitous because interactive displays supposedly attract younger visitors, signaling a shift toward flashy digital experiences over meaningful, non-digital exhibitions.

## 9. [Harvey Mudd Miniature Machine](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45163998)

**Total comment counts : 2**

### Summary

 Hmmm is a Python-based tool that by default assembles and runs files written in Hmmm assembly. It offers options to assemble without running, to run a previously assembled program, and to use a built-in debugger. It exposes 16 registers (15 hardware-interchangeable); r0 is special—zero as a source and discarded as a destination. In debug mode, it prints after each instruction the executed instruction and its memory location (PC) and shows a debug prompt. The prompt accepts c/d/h/p/q/r commands; unrecognized input steps one instruction. The assembler reports only one error per line at a time.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The note is tangential but states that the best real-analysis course that finally clicked for the author came from Harvey Mudd, a solid university. It also includes a link to a Harvey Mudd YouTube playlist (PL04BA7A9EB907EDAF).

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The speaker gets excited, then is disappointed to learn Harvey Mudd isn’t Henry Mudd; they believe the project would be more credible if it involved Henry Mudd.
