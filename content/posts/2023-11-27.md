 The article criticizes Microsoft's Edge browser, stating several reasons why it is seen as worse than Google Chrome. First, it mentions that Chromium-based browsers, including Edge, will eventually block uBlock Origin due to compatibility issues. The article also points out that Edge is considered spyware and worse than Chrome in terms of privacy because Microsoft is an advertising company. In the EU, Edge asks users to agree to share personal data with the advertising industry, which cannot be avoided. Additionally, Edge exposes an advertising ID and has telemetry that cannot be turned off. The article highlights that Edge does not end-to-end encrypt synchronized data and is hard-coded to use Bing, while it is easier to use Chrome without Google. The author recommends alternative Chromium browsers such as Vivaldi, Brave, or Arc for macOS users. Overall, the article strongly criticizes Edge, considering it to be intrusive and inferior to other browser options.

## 5. [Noninvasive theta-burst stimulation enhances skill learning](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38424061)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 This article discusses a novel noninvasive technology called transcranial electrical temporal interference stimulation (tTIS), which enables the stimulation of deep brain structures without invasive methods. The researchers successfully demonstrated the noninvasive neuromodulation of the striatum (a deep brain structure) in humans using computational modeling, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, and behavioral evaluations. The tTIS technique increased activity in the striatum and improved motor performance, particularly in healthy older participants. These findings have important implications for understanding the functional role of deep brain structures and developing noninvasive treatment strategies for brain disorders where these structures are involved.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of psychedelic microdosing for purposes other than problem solving and creativity. The author suggests that microdosing LSD or shrooms, combined with specific exercises and techniques, can improve rapid motor skill development. The author shares their personal experience as a tango dancer, stating that microdosing has significantly reduced their learning time and has received positive feedback from others in the tango community. The author's partner, who started tango only two years ago, is also using microdosing for training and social dancing, and many people believe she has been dancing for much longer. The article concludes by acknowledging that the sample size is small but suggests that the increased neural plasticity during a microdosing experience may contribute to these improvements.

 The user is inquiring if the article is related to tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation), a method known for enhancing learning. They have heard that tDCS is effective for this purpose and are curious if the article discusses it.

## 6. [How Apple's developers reflashed Mac ROMs in the '90s](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38429460)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses the discovery of an internal utility used by Apple developers in the 68k Mac era to reflash the ROM in their Macs during development. The utility was uploaded to the Macintosh Garden and was recovered from a prototype PowerBook 520. The author tested the utility on their LC 475 and found that it could detect and save the existing ROM but was unable to flash a new ROM image. The author then disassembled the utility to understand its functions and discovered a table of entries for compatible ROMs, including those for PDS cards. Further analysis revealed information about the flash manufacturer, device ID, base addresses, and size of the ROM chips. The utility also had a list of allowed gestalt machine IDs to determine compatibility. Overall, the article provides insight into the capabilities of the ROM flashing utility and the compatibility of Macs and ROM SIMMs.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author recalls working on an 8-bit system during a time when they couldn't afford flash devices and the necessary tools to reprogram them. However, they found a workaround by using a special daughterboard with SRAM that replaced the ROM and allowed them to write an image into the address space. The only drawback was that the image would be lost upon powering down, explaining why EEPROM was more significant for Apple in developing their systems.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is asking for examples of PDS (Processor Direct Slot) cards from the past. They mention that the Newton development boards from that time period may have resembled PDS cards. The author admits their memory of that era is not clear.

### Summary

 The article discusses the adoption of Prettier, a JavaScript code formatter, and its focus on improving performance. The Prettier team recently offered a $10k bounty for any Rust project that could pass 95% of Prettier's test suite, which was matched by Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch and supplemented by napi.rs. The Biome project claimed the bounty and provided a faster implementation of Prettier. The competition not only improved compatibility but also revealed bugs and questionable decisions in Prettier. The article acknowledges the donations that made the bounty and Prettier's success possible, and calls for further donations to sustain the project. The benefits of using Open Collective for funding are also highlighted. Overall, the article demonstrates the collaborative efforts to enhance code formatting and improve the developer experience.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the reasons behind the Prettier team funding another project, despite Prettier being a dominant code formatter for JavaScript. The lack of competition has led to little motivation to improve performance and address various issues. The author questions why the team didn't set a bounty to improve Prettier instead of creating a competing project, suggesting that it may lead to unnecessary fragmentation. The author expresses confusion and wonders if the end goal is to shut down Prettier and encourage the use of the Rust based project.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The Biome project found bugs and questionable decisions in the Prettier tool through various tests. They plan to use this knowledge to make improvements in their own implementation.

## 10. [Build your own hi-fi ear defenders](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38425067)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's quest to find an inexpensive solution to protect their hearing while playing loud music. They wanted to be able to hear themselves, their bandmates, and the audience with high fidelity. The author's solution was to adapt the idea of pass-through systems by placing ambient microphones on the outside of sound-isolating headphones. They tested different microphones and learned that a microphone's listed acoustic overload point (AOP) doesn't indicate when clipping will occur. They eventually found a microphone that met their needs. The article also mentions the use of an audio codec to translate incoming sound signals into audible sounds.
