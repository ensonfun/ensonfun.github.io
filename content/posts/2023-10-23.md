## 5. [OpenTelemetry at Scale: Using Kafka to handle bursty traffic](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37978060)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 This article discusses the concept of a multi-collector architecture in OpenTelemetry observability deployments and how Apache Kafka can be used in this context. The OpenTelemetry Collector is a recommended component that gathers and manages data before sending it to the observability backend. However, in cases where a single collector is not sufficient, a multi-collector architecture can be implemented. This allows for scalability, reduced network traffic, and data filtering or sampling at the intermediate collector before forwarding it to the central collector. The proposed solution in the article is to use a Kafka queue, which provides reliable event ingestion and improved data reliability. Both the use of an internal queue and a collector-to-collector architecture can enhance the reliability of observability data. The article highlights the strengths of the OpenTelemetry Collector in data gathering, compression, and filtering, while Apache Kafka excels in situations where high reliability and data buffering are key. The multi-collector architecture, combined with a Kafka queue, offers a scalable and efficient approach to handling large volumes of telemetry data in an observability system.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the architecture used by large-scale players like Datadog and New Relic, where data passes through an edge before landing in a Kafka cluster. It mentions that OpenTelemetry (otel) components lack rate limiting, which can easily overload backend storage like S3. Grafana has implemented solutions to mitigate this issue by using memcached. The article provides links to further information on these topics.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Kafka is commonly used for handling traffic bursts in elasticsearch clusters, but other distributed queues like Redpanda, Pulsar, and NATS can also be used. One notable feature of Kafka is that it allows for achieving exactly-once semantic without much effort by tracking the positions of partitions in a separate database. However, a drawback of using Kafka is that it adds another piece to maintain, which can be a significant task.
