## 1. [Stripe Launches L1 Blockchain: Tempo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45129085)

**Total comment counts : 69**

### Summary

 Tempo is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain incubated by Stripe and Paradigm, built specifically for real-world payments. It supports all major stablecoins, handles over 100,000 transactions per second with sub-second finality, and offers near-zero, predictable fees. The design emphasizes privacy and compliance (ISO 20022-ready memos, on-chain settlement, and compliance hooks) for cross-border and B2B payments. Features include a built-in stablecoin exchange, batch transfers, programmable payments, and fast cross-border settlement. Initial validators are independent entities, with a path to permissionless operation; developer docs are forthcoming.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Crypto skeptics on Hacker News have shifted: real-world businesses are finding stablecoins useful. Bridge, a stablecoin orchestration platform (acquired by Stripe), is used by SpaceX to manage money in long-tail markets. DolarApp provides banking services in Latin America. Stripe is adding stablecoin functionality, with its first user an Argentinian bike importer facing supplier payments challenges. These companies aren’t using crypto for speculation; they’re doing real financial activity, finding stablecoins faster, cheaper, and better than the status quo.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article outlines a simple Stripe play: embed stablecoin infrastructure into its payments flow to control funds moving into stablecoins. Stablecoin providers earn on their float (about 4% annually) and share a portion with partners. If Stripe converts even 3% of its massive transaction volume into stablecoins and earns 1% net on that, it could add roughly $1 billion in annual profit. Given an estimated $10 billion daily volume, the math suggests substantial upside from stablecoin-based revenue.

## 2. [Classic 8×8-pixel B&W Mac patterns](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45131538)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 An engineer created a website for 38 original 8×8 Mac desktop patterns from System 1.0 (1984). They extracted the QuickDraw PAT# patterns from a System 6 disk using Mini vMac, ExportFl, sitPack, The Unarchiver, and DeRez, preserving the system’s resource fork. A Python script converts the data to .pbm (Netpbm); images can then be generated in any format with ImageMagick, using -filter point to avoid blur. The project aims to archive these patterns exactly. Visit the pattern site to download. Credit: Paul Smith.

 The passage expresses nostalgia and joy, and marvels at how certain visual effects can be produced with a tiny data footprint—8x8 pixels, equivalent to a single integer—on modern architectures.

## 3. [Age Simulation Suit](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45129190)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 GERT is an age-simulation suit that lets younger people experience common age-related impairments: lens opacity, narrowed visual field, high-frequency hearing loss, limited head mobility, joint stiffness, reduced strength, weaker grip, and diminished coordination. The new version includes two pairs of glasses. It has positive reviews (7 ratings, 4.9) and is praised for durability and teaching about elderly behavior. Certified by the European Competence Centre for Accessibility and widely popular worldwide. Due to processing delays, orders require a minimum value of 300 euros or pounds.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 An 85-year-old father’s aging struggle illustrates a downward, self-reinforcing spiral: mobility issues make curbs and steps daunting, so he does fewer activities; watching TV becomes a safe default, which reduces brain stimulation and makes everyday problem-solving harder. The author notes this empathy has made them more patient with others on crowded sidewalks. Aging is rough, they conclude, and they thank researchers and developers who work on accessibility and aging-related tech and science.

## 4. [WiFi signals can measure heart rate](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45127983)

**Total comment counts : 22**

### Summary

 UC Santa Cruz engineers developed Pulse-Fi, a WiFi-based system that measures heart rate without wearables. Using ultra-low-cost devices (ESP32 chips and Raspberry Pi) and a machine-learning algorithm, it detects tiny WiFi signal changes caused by a heartbeat. Trained with ground-truth oximeter data and a Brazilian Raspberry Pi dataset, the model separates heartbeat signals from environmental noise and movement. In tests with 118 participants across 17 body positions, Pulse-Fi achieved clinical-level accuracy after five seconds, working up to 3 meters away and across device placement. Published at DCOSS-IoT 2025; implications for low-resource home health.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 After upgrading from gpt-4.1-mini to gpt-5-mini, performance was poor, so I switched to mistral-medium-0525. It provides similar price but dramatically better results, higher reliability, and about 10x faster. The main drawback is when it fails, it fails harder. gpt-5-mini often ignored prompt formatting, while mistral-medium adheres to formatting 99% of the time but, in 1% of cases, inserts random characters (usually backticks), causing formatting issues. Overall, very happy with Mistral so far.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author asks if third-party MCP implementations can be placed in the connector directory. They describe an MCP connector they built that can access numerous file-transfer protocols (S3, FTP(S), SFTP, SMB, NFS, Google Drive, Dropbox, Azure Blob, OneDrive, SharePoint, etc.). It includes layers for delegated authentication, RBAC-based authorization, and chrooting to limit LLM misbehavior, plus tools to visualize or edit hundreds of file formats. They’d like it listed and note it’s open-source at GitHub: mickael-kerjean/filestash.

## 7. [30 minutes with a stranger](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45124003)

**Total comment counts : 54**

### Summary

 Two volunteers, Kate and Dawn, join a 30-minute video call as part of the CANDOR corpus—about 1,700 conversations among 1,500 people aimed at studying how we communicate. The project examines “bonding” vs. “bridging” social capital, noting people often talk with those similar to them, amid fears of talking to strangers. Yet experiments show strangers often have positive experiences. Mood tends to improve mid-conversation, while the pandemic reduced weak-tie interactions. Many talks touch intimate topics, though videos cannot be published due to privacy concerns.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Online conversations tend to become petty, unlike real-life talks. The author believes you should talk to strangers: most people are warm, and people often reveal intimate details when they feel confidential. They recount meeting a serial killer who did this and describe a neighbor sharing her divorce on a flight. Face-to-face disagreements are easier to handle, especially with people whose beliefs differ; being together discourages ridicule or condemnation. The message: practice talking to others; loneliness is a main cause of many modern problems, and having outlets for expression helps.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author argues that social isolation is the defining social ill of our era, with loneliness fueling much of today’s hate. While they insist on correcting false beliefs, they contend that online hostility stems from loneliness rather than genuine conviction. They cite emerging evidence from ScienceDirect studies and psychiatry outlets indicating that loneliness fuels online extremism and harmful beliefs.

## 8. [Atlassian is acquiring The Browser Company](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45126358)

**Total comment counts : 95**

### Summary

 I can’t summarize because no article text is provided—only a reference line and two identical EdgeSuite error URLs: https://errors.edgesuite.net/18.a7f4d517.1757019161.1b49d0ca. Without the article content, a summary isn’t possible. If you share the article text, I’ll condense it to under 100 words. If you want a quick note on the snippet: it appears to be an error reference or diagnostic ID from EdgeSuite CDN, likely indicating a failed resource load, but specifics require the page content.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Arc’s core idea—treat the browser as the OS and build a browser that serves as the platform—was strong. It showed solid early validation, but growth plateaued, which the author views as normal; the task is to diagnose and fix the stall rather than pivot to AI. The writer wouldn’t be surprised if investors are frustrated and seeking an exit, which could be a reasonable outcome given the circumstances.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author, a fan of Arc, criticizes The Browser Company’s pivot to Dia, viewing Dia as an AI hype move aimed at investors rather than consumers. They note Arc’s novelty may limit uptake and question Atlassian’s consumer relevance since it targets business SaaS. The piece envisions Arc as a middleware hub linking daily SaaS tools—e.g., auto-linking Shortcut tickets to Slack and enabling side-by-side views—to reduce constant context switching. In short, Arc’s potential lies in cross-SaaS workflow integration rather than being a standalone browser.

## 9. [Action was the best 8-bit programming language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45131243)

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 Action! was an all-new compiled language for the Atari 8-bit, created by Clinton Parker and released by OSS in 1983. Packaged as a 16K cartridge, it integrated a monitor, compiler, text editor, and debugger—effectively an early IDE for 8‑bit systems. The structured, procedural language resembled a simplified C/Pascal, with three data types (BYTE, CARD, INT) and no switch/case; strings were BYTE arrays. The editor supported full-screen editing, rightward scrolling, copy/paste, line tagging, and split-screen views. It retailed for $99; Apple II/Commodore 64 versions were planned but never released.

 A brief question asking whether there is any relation to ActionScript.

## 10. [Melvyn Bragg steps down from presenting In Our Time](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45124143)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 Melvyn Bragg has stepped down as host of BBC Radio 4’s In Our Time after 26 years and over 1,000 episodes. Since its 1998 launch, Bragg’s leadership helped the show become a global hit and a popular BBC Sounds podcast for under-35s. A new presenter will take over later this year, with Bragg remaining at the BBC and a new series planned for 2026. BBC officials laud his intellect and public service. The program will air cherished episodes and feature a BBC Sounds selection. Bragg’s career spans broadcasting, novels, and non-fiction.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author loves In Our Time for its well-moderated expert discussions but dislikes other programs' poorer moderation. Their main complaint is that the BBC now inserts mid-discussion ads with a loud chime, which disrupts listening, especially when guests speak softly.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The post notes that the BBC's IOT has over 1,000 episodes and, from what the author has heard, they’re all brilliant, asking readers for favorites. They recall enjoying the Plankton episode, which began with skepticism but led them to explore the reading list, and they provide a link to the BBC program m001r1t5.
