## 7. [The physics of airplane flight](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40835223)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The article discusses the misconception that wings need to have a specific airfoil shape to function. It explains that any surface can create lift and function as a wing. Increasing the angle of attack of a surface creates lift, but beyond a certain angle, it can cause a stall and decrease lift. Airplanes use proper airfoil geometry to generate more lift before stalling and create less drag. The article also discusses the concepts of center of mass and center of pressure. A plane needs to be stable and return to its preferred orientation and speed after a disturbance. The article explains how stability is achieved through pitch, yaw, and roll axes. Stability in each axis depends on factors like dihedral angle and the position of the center of mass relative to the wing's center of lift. Pitch stability is unique because the plane needs a positive angle of attack to maintain flight. A horizontal stabilizer is used to pitch the plane up.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article questions whether the concept of Bernoulli's principle is still taught to children as an explanation for why planes can fly. The author argues that Newton's third law should suffice, as it is clear that the wings push air down and the air pushes the wing up. They criticize the Bernoulli argument by stating that it is empirically wrong and logically inconsistent. The author believes that the simpler explanation of the wings pushing air down and the air pushing the wing up is more accurate.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of canards in aircraft design to address the problem of inefficiency caused by the need to pitch down the horizontal stabilizer relative to the wings.
