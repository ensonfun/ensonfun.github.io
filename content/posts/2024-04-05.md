 The round valley reservoir near the author's location has been undergoing work for years. Last fall, it received authorization to be pumped back to full capacity, a process that was expected to take years. However, due to heavy rainfall, the reservoir has already been pumped back to 92% capacity from 66%. The author is wondering if this increase in water volume has affected the fault's pressure. They provide a link to the daily operations data of the reservoir. The author also mentions experiencing aftershocks, including a recent 2.0 earthquake. They provide a link to the earthquake's information on the USGS website.

 The author expresses skepticism about the use of non-deterministic compilers, stating that finding and fixing issues caused by underlying layers can be costly. They believe that long-lived mutable objects (LLMs) have a lot of progress to make before such use cases become appealing.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential direction of LLM (Language and Learning Model) research, suggesting that it may move towards a setup where LLMs focus on extracting entities and relations, while the actual logic is performed by a logical engine like Prolog. The writer humorously compares this future scenario to the concept that an advanced LLM would be indistinguishable from Prolog.

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 A former University of Iowa Hospital employee, Matthew David Keirans, pleaded guilty to federal charges for living under another man's identity since 1988. Keirans used the name William Donald Woods and obtained employment, insurance, and official documents under this false identity. He also paid taxes and obtained fraudulent identification cards.

The real William Woods discovered the identity theft when he went to a bank to close his accounts. Keirans was terminated from his job due to the identity theft investigation. He was convicted of false statements and aggravated identity theft, facing up to 32 years in federal prison.

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses a new tactic being used by fake law firms to demand backlinks from website owners. It tells the story of a writer who received a DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice from a law firm called Commonwealth Legal, requesting that he add a credit to their client, Tech4Gods, on his website within five days. However, there are several issues that suggest Commonwealth Legal is not a legitimate firm, such as its questionable registration date and location, as well as the AI-generated faces on its website. The article explains that the motive behind these fake law firms is to obtain backlinks, which are important for search engine optimization. The owner of Tech4Gods admits to buying backlinks for his site and suspects a former contractor may be trying to harm his ranking with spam links. As of the time the article was written, the writer had not heard back from Commonwealth Legal.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that the legal system is inaccessible and non-existent for individuals and small to medium-sized companies. Only large corporations and law firms have the resources to afford using the legal system, which leads to an imbalance of power. Even big tech companies often avoid legal battles due to the high costs involved, but if they do engage, they usually come out victorious. As a result, individuals and smaller entities are vulnerable to abuse in various ways.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the issue of copyright claims and settlement offers for online content. The author explains that such claims are common and often accompanied by offers ranging from $200 to $1,000 to resolve them. The author states that approximately 50% of the claims are scams, while 45% are legitimate, resulting in settlements being paid and writers being reminded about citing images and copyright. The remaining 5% of cases are described as the worst, as some photographers with open licenses like CC BY-NC partner with law firms to send demand letters to businesses that improperly use the open license, exploiting nuances of open licenses and confusing writers who may miss the NC part of the license review. The author expresses their disdain for using open licenses like Creative Commons to make money through copyright shakedowns.

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article introduces a new blog called Más Bandwidth that focuses on game network programming and scalable backend engineering. It discusses topics such as games with thousands of players, virtual worlds, performance in virtual spaces, overlay worlds in augmented reality, telepresence and remote working in virtual reality, and game streaming. The author predicts that with the advancement of internet speed in the next 10 years, there will be significant changes in game development and usage of bandwidth. The article also explains the use of XDP/eBPF technology, a kernel bypass technology for achieving maximum bandwidth for applications. It provides an overview of how XDP/eBPF works, what can be done with it, and includes example code for simple XDP programs. The article also mentions the eBPF technology that allows for compiling, linking, and running XDP programs in the Linux Kernel. There are instructions provided on how to set up the machine for compiling and running eBPF programs.

 The article suggests calling eBPF "kernel shaders" in order to confuse people in the graphics, OS, and GPGPU fields.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article claims to have developed a high-performance metaverse client that can download half a gigabit per second or more. They argue that the XDP (eXpress Data Path) technology, which is designed to improve network performance, is addressing the wrong problem for the metaverse. They explain that most of the traffic in a metaverse consists of downloading bulk content, with highly interactive traffic over UDP (User Datagram Protocol) being minimal. The author also mentions that latency is important for interactive traffic but not as crucial for large file transfers. Practical issues such as data caps are mentioned, and the author warns against using game-specific code in the kernel due to security concerns.
