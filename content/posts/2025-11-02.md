- Concern: The main worry is that self-hosting can be time-consuming and brittle in practice, risking maintenance overhead and professional impact.  
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from praise for BSD's simplicity and nostalgia for FreeBSD to frustration with hardware support and setup pain, plus a pragmatic shift to Linux or cloud hosting and a belief that the learning phase is the real reward.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed (nostalgic yet pragmatic).

## 2. [Paris Had a Moving Sidewalk in 1900, and a Thomas Edison Film Captured It](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45793466)

**Total comment counts : 0**

### Summary

 Moving sidewalks, once a novelty, astonished visitors at the 1900 Paris Exposition and drew Thomas Edison’s attention; his producer James Henry White shot at least 16 films using a new panning tripod. Contemporary images show reactions as a trott oir roulant—an “endless floor” about 30 feet above ground—circulated on three elevated platforms: stationary, moderate pace, and about six mph. Though earlier versions appeared at Chicago’s 1893 Columbian Exposition, Paris’ demonstration was more impressive. Some saw promise for public transit as well as entertainment.

## 3. [Linux gamers on Steam cross over the 3% mark](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45792503)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 October 2025 Steam Hardware & Software Survey shows Linux gamers at 3% of Steam, boosted by the Steam Deck and SteamOS Linux. Valve hasn’t published monthly active users since 2022, but even the old figures imply over 4 million Linux users, with current numbers likely higher due to Deck sales. The share is sustained by Steam Deck popularity and Steam’s top-seller status, and rumors of a Steam Frame powered by Linux could lift it further. The trend aligns with Windows 10 reaching end of support.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on switching to Linux for gaming and the growing viability thanks to Proton/Lutris/SteamOS, while acknowledging remaining gaps for anti-cheat and certain titles.  
- Concern: The main worry is that anti-cheat systems and a few popular multiplayer games (e.g., Fortnite) still don’t run well on Linux, risking ongoing Windows dependence.  
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from strong satisfaction with Linux gaming—good performance and broad compatibility—to ongoing frustration over driver quirks, setup overhead, and the need to dual-boot or keep Windows for unplayable games.  
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 4. [Lisp: Notes on its Past and Future (1980)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45792579)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 John McCarthy argues that Lisp has endured as a near-optimal local choice among programming languages but has collected “barnacles” and missed improvement opportunities. He advocates cooperative maintenance, especially for building and sustaining libraries. Computer-checked proofs of correctness are now possible for pure Lisp and some extensions, but more theory and smoother language design are needed to fully leverage Lisp’s mathematical foundations.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The core topic is evaluating whether Clojure is a better fit than Rust for non-low-level coding while considering Lisp’s future in light of predictions that higher-level, largely declarative languages may supplant Lisp.
- Concern: There is a worry that Lisp-family languages could be replaced by an even higher-level, declarative language (potentially AI-assisted) that changes how programming is done and which languages are adopted.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from favoring Clojure over Rust for simplicity in non-low-level tasks, to predicting Lisp will be superseded by a more declarative language, to noting that programmers often grasp procedural languages more easily, which helps explain Lisp’s popularity decline.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 5. [Reproducing the AWS Outage Race Condition with a Model Checker](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45792373)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 AWS published a post-mortem on an outage caused by a race condition in DynamoDB’s automated DNS management (DNS Planner, DNS Enactor, Route 53). The article uses a simplified Spin model (Promela) to explore how parallel Enactors could interleave: Enactor 2 applies a new plan and cleans up while another Enactor applies an older plan, potentially deleting the active one and causing DNS failure. The model uses one Planner and two Enactors with channels and state (current_plan, dns_valid, highest_plan_applied) and checks invariants to reveal concurrency bugs.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on using formal methods (like TLA+) to analyze real-world distributed systems, acknowledging that practical deviations from ideal models and trade-offs (e.g., log retention, tombstones) complicate such analysis.
- Concern: It is unclear whether formal modeling provides meaningful, practical value given costs, the learning curve, and potential misalignment with actual RCAs and code.
- Perspectives: Some see value in detailed failure-mode modeling with TLA+, others question its usefulness, note that some practitioners (e.g., at AWS) may do extensive internal modeling, and several commenters express reluctance or desire for a basic introduction.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [Why don't you use dependent types?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45790827)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 Isabelle dispenses with proof objects because they’re unnecessary and wasteful; type checking in the implementation language can enforce legitimate steps, echoing Milner’s LCF kernel. The author recalls decades with dependent types, studying AUTOMATH with de Bruijn, and formalizing texts line-by-line. AUTOMATH was a logical framework, not Curry–Howard–de Bruijn; Isabelle inherits that idea. Isabelle began as Martin-Löf type theory (Isabelle/CTT) but, disillusioned by the shift to intensional equality, the author’s work suffered. Isabelle/HOL eventually dominated, superseding the original Martin-Löf emphasis.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread compares dependent types and their practical value in theorem proving, weighing Lean, Isabelle, and HOL, and considers how library design, tooling, and performance influence their adoption in software verification and mathematics.
- Concern: The central risk is that heavy dependent types can complicate understanding, debugging, and performance, making real-world verification less approachable unless tooling and libraries mitigate these issues.
- Perspectives: Opinions range from praising dependent types for expressive power and proofs (Lean's community and mathlib) to favoring a pragmatic, less type-centric approach (Isabelle/AFP, HOL) with automation and production-readiness, advocating using dependent types only where beneficial.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed.

## 7. [Solar-powered QR reading postboxes being rolled out across UK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45745415)

**Total comment counts : 1**

### Summary

 Royal Mail will roll out 3,500 solar-powered postboxes across the UK, replacing the classic red pillar with a white panel topped by solar cells. A barcode scanner opens a drop-down parcel drawer large enough for items up to shoebox size, powered by solar energy. The design, which maintains the red top for branding, was piloted in Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire and will roll out to Edinburgh, Nottingham, Sheffield, and Manchester. The boxes are part of its push to expand parcel services amid online shopping, competition from Evri and Yodel, and fines for missing delivery targets.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Royal Mail being bought by a Czech billionaire raises concerns about public assets being owned by ultra-wealthy individuals.
- Concern: The worry is that ordinary people lose control and public services are steered by the interests of billionaires.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from strong condemnation of billionaire ownership of public assets to a resigned belief that such power dynamics are inevitable.
- Overall sentiment: Highly critical

## 8. [Tongyi DeepResearch – open-source 30B MoE Model that rivals OpenAI DeepResearch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45789602)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 Tongyi DeepResearch is the first fully open-source Web Agent matching OpenAI’s DeepResearch across benchmarks (HLE 32.9; BrowseComp 43.4; BrowseComp-ZH 46.7; xbench-DeepSearch 75), outperforming existing agents. The project delivers a complete training and inference pipeline: Agentic CPT, SFT, RL with automated data curation; a ReAct-based inference framework and Heavy Mode for test-time scaling. Key methods include large-scale data synthesis via AgentFounder, an entity-anchored knowledge memory, and high-quality synthetic QA through a graph-based, difficulty-controlled pipeline (with obfuscation). It uses formal set-theory modeling, automated QA engines, and iterative complexity upgrades, plus IterResearch with ReAct.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on the future trajectory of AI models, weighing specialization and frontier-model progress against continued pretraining, and how practical deployment (including self-hosting and training environments) will shape value in a competitive landscape.
- Concern: The main worry is that gains may plateau as pretraining returns diminish, and that deployment hurdles, interface design, and open competition could blunt usefulness and erode moats.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from optimism about leveraging specialized training environments and self-hosted setups to skepticism about the practical value of some tools and worries about UI/UX, data recall, performance, and global competition, notably with China.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 9. [Alleged Jabber Zeus Coder 'MrICQ' in U.S. Custody](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45793244)

**Total comment counts : 0**

### Summary

 A Ukrainian man, Yuriy Igorevich Rybtsov (aka MrICQ), once a developer for the Jabber Zeus cybercrime group, was indicted in 2012 for conspiring to steal tens of millions from U.S. firms. He was arrested in Italy and, after losing a 2025 appeal, faces extradition to the United States. Jabber Zeus used a ZeuS-based malware to intercept banking credentials and one-time passwords (Leprechaun), enabling payroll manipulation and money mule–based laundering. Leader Vyacheslav Penchukov (“Tank”) was sentenced to 18 years and $73 million restitution; researcher Lawrence Baldwin provided chat records to authorities.
