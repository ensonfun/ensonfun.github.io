## 1. [We have used too many levels of abstractions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37965142)

**Total comment counts : 116**

### Summary

 The article discusses the problem of increasing abstraction and automation in the tech industry, which is leading to a lack of understanding and knowledge among professionals. Abstractions, such as steering wheels and power steering, improve the user experience, but when they break, people no longer understand how to fix them. The tech industry prioritizes profit over deeper understanding, leading to the consolidation of roles such as DevOps and DevSecOps, where individuals are expected to handle various tasks. As a result, modern tech professionals are only taught how to use specific tools and lack knowledge about the underlying technology. This becomes problematic when the majority of people in the industry don't know how to fix the tools they are using. The article also highlights the issue of security, where many "security people" only know how to use pre-made tools without truly understanding security principles. This can result in vulnerabilities and data breaches going unnoticed. The author provides an example of a company that had hired developers who lacked understanding of the coding framework and security, leading to performance issues and a hidden hacking incident. The author emphasizes the importance of having a deeper understanding of technology and the ability to manually inspect code and files to uncover hidden issues.

**Total comment counts : 55**

### Summary

 The article discusses the problem of external stakeholders questioning and pushing for lower estimates from development teams without proper knowledge or facts. These stakeholders often compromise trust and set unrealistic expectations for software delivery. The article compares this behavior to someone telling a meteorologist that the weather forecast will be better without any basis. It emphasizes that the development team uses their expertise and data to estimate effort, but they have limited control over it. The article suggests having a more productive discussion by considering ways to omit certain features and prioritize those with higher value. It also recommends gathering data and insights from actual users to make more informed decisions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the idea of increasing sales quotas for salespeople. It compares this to asking meteorologists to make the sun shine, implying that it is unrealistic. However, the article argues that pushing salespeople to increase their quotas is necessary in order for them to work more effectively and accomplish the same amount of work more quickly. It suggests that self-set quotas by salespeople themselves may not be sufficient, as they could choose numbers that are easily attainable but below what the business truly needs. The article emphasizes the importance of tying salespeople's compensation to hitting higher quotas and suggests that salespeople should accept and strive to meet these increased targets instead of complaining about management's expectations.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

## 7. [Pigging](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37964095)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 Pigging is a maintenance process used in pipeline transportation to clean and inspect pipelines without interrupting the flow of the product. It involves using pipeline inspection gadgets called pigs or scrapers, which are inserted into the pipeline through a pig launcher and pushed along by the pressure-driven flow of the product until they reach the pig catcher. Pigging is commonly used in the oil industry but is also increasingly being used in other industries to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The pigs can be used to separate different products in a multiproduct pipeline, clear liquid slugs, and inspect pipelines for leaks and damage. Pigging requires pipelines to be designed to accommodate pigging, and there are different types of pigs for various purposes, such as cleaning, inspecting, and batching products. Safety measures, such as valve interlocks, are important during pigging operations to prevent accidents. There are different types of pigs, including foam pigs for cleaning, intelligent pigs for inspection, and caliper pigs for measuring the roundness of the pipeline. Positional data is collected during the pigging run to determine the exact path taken and the location, type, and size of pipe defects. This information helps operators plan repairs and prevent leaks or environmental damage. Pigging has also been featured in popular culture, including in James Bond films and other books and shows.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience writing software for a pig tracking company. They highlight the blend of low and high-tech methods used in the industry. Pigs are capable of detecting leaks and mapping pipe dimensions, but speed measurements are often taken by listening for the pig passing a weld joint with a stopwatch. The article mentions that pigs frequently get stuck, causing delays. In rare cases, pigs may get stuck for days or break in the pipe, requiring technicians to estimate their location and dig in someone's backyard. Towards the end, the author's girlfriend asks for their input on raising pigs, indicating a different type of pig tracking.
