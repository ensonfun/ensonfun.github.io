## 1. [Did you lose your AirPods?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41334207)

**Total comment counts : 65**

### Summary

 The article is about a person who found a pair of AirPods and wanted to find the owner by using the serial number and the last four digits of their phone number. Instead of spamming all possible phone numbers, they narrowed down the search by assuming the owner lived in the same area and had an iPhone with iMessage turned on. By filtering the list and using a script to send iMessages, they were able to locate the owner and return the AirPods.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author reminisces about their student days nearly 20 years ago when they were interested in setting up websites but didn't have money to buy domain names. They found free hosting on Geocities but were disappointed with the format of the website's URL. Eventually, they discovered 20m.com, which offered 20 MB of free hosting space and allowed them to publish their website under a subdomain. Surprisingly, one of the websites they created back then is still functional. The author adds a disclaimer about the content, stating that they were young and naive at the time.

## 5. [The UX of HTML (2023)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41310921)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The author discusses the lack of understanding and implementation of semantic HTML in websites. They describe their experience teaching students who initially viewed semantics as unimportant, but became interested when they framed it as the user experience (UX) of HTML. The author demonstrates the importance of semantic HTML by showing how it enhances user interactions, accessibility, and functionality. They highlight the neglect of proper semantic HTML in the web development community, despite years of awareness and conferences promoting its importance. The author also mentions the challenges in understanding and implementing HTML5's sectioning elements.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article describes their frustration with trying to follow semantic HTML guidelines in their personal experience building small web apps. They feel that the rules for semantic HTML are focused on static, text-based documents and don't accommodate other formats well. They give the example of headings in component-based development, where they often don't know or need to know the level of a heading in their reusable widget, but are forced to choose one anyway. Despite wanting to follow the rules, they find themselves using divs and h2s instead because it is easier to work with.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses several HTML elements that have limitations and are often criticized. One example is checkboxes that cannot be styled, but are necessary. To overcome this, checkboxes are hidden and replaced with pseudo elements. However, this workaround requires loading an entire font to ensure consistent rendering of the check mark. Another problematic element is the select and option elements, which are so bad that even iOS violates its own guidelines by displaying them on a separate page. The article also mentions challenges with the developer experience, such as difficulties in stopping a selection with JavaScript or hooking up an element handler for change. Despite these shortcomings, the author strives to use the "correct" elements.

## 8. [Meta cancels high-end mixed reality headset after Apple Vision Pro struggles](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41331369)

**Total comment counts : 38**

### Summary

 Meta has canceled the development of a high-end mixed reality headset that was meant to compete with Apple's Vision Pro. The decision came after a product review meeting involving Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The headset, slated for launch in 2027, would have been equipped with high-resolution micro OLED displays, similar to Apple's Vision Pro. However, the high cost of these displays made it impossible for Meta to sell the device for under $1,000. Instead, Meta will focus on developing the Quest 4, a successor to the Quest 3, which is expected to be released in 2026 at a price point of $500. Meta is also prioritizing software development and announced a Horizon OS platform for third-party hardware makers. In contrast, Apple has faced challenges with the consumer appeal of the Vision Pro, leading to reduced shipments and plans for a more affordable model with fewer features.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article shares their experience with the Vision Pro VR headset, particularly highlighting the sense of teleportation it provided. They mention using VR to bring their loved ones to places they couldn't physically go and emphasize the potential value of VR in capturing and reliving important memories. While acknowledging the current limitations of VR technology, the author believes that with time, VR will become more widespread and accessible. The article concludes by suggesting that people should try VR before dismissing it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the reasons why large companies are heavily investing in augmented reality (AR). It states that the companies are interested in obtaining egocentric data and gaining control over the human senses of vision and sound, as this data pipeline is considered highly valuable. The ultimate goal is to predict and shape human behavior using their platforms. The article mentions that Google had previously made a teaser trailer about this concept called Hyperreality. The companies aim to achieve perfect attention from users and create an interface similar to the one seen in the movie "The Matrix." However, introducing this interface too quickly could scare people, which is why Apple rushed its AR efforts while companies like Meta (formerly Facebook) are strategically timing their releases. The ultimate objective is to create spyware that controls users' behavior, with examples cited being the working conditions in Target, Amazon, and Walmart warehouses. The corporate goal is to have everyone within their ecosystem consistently creating, consuming, and engaging for optimal attention tuning.

## 10. [JavaScript dates are about to be fixed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41339493)

**Total comment counts : 52**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Temporal proposal in ECMAScript, which introduces the Temporal API. The author highlights the main advantage of the proposal, which is the availability of a native object to represent a "Zoned Date Time." The article explains that when working with dates in JavaScript, the original semantics of the date are lost because they are represented as plain numbers. This causes issues when trying to convert a human date to a JavaScript date. The article provides an example of recording a payment moment and how it can be problematic due to time zone differences. The Temporal API addresses these issues by introducing the Temporal.ZonedDateTime object to represent dates and times with their corresponding time zone. The article also mentions the proposed extension to RFC 3339 for standardizing the serialization and deserialization of date strings. Overall, the Temporal proposal solves the problem of working with only timestamps and provides a solution for representing dates and times with time zones.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article expresses frustration with JavaScript's handling of dates and times. It criticizes Moment and Python's Arrow library for conflating dates, times, and datetimes, leading to various problems. The author praises Rust's Chrono library as generally predictable and having fewer flaws compared to other languages like Python and JavaScript.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that using more examples of future dates would make it more convincing. The author also believes that for timestamp purposes, UTC and a location are sufficient. They argue that in the example of a bank, it is not a case of lost information but rather poor user experience, as the bank could map transactions to a local time zone if desired.
