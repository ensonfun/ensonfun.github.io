### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article argues that defining your own types in C is not necessary and can be confusing for programmers who are already familiar with C types. However, they suggest that it does make sense to be specific about sizes, such as using uint32_t instead of uint, to avoid potential issues with architecture-dependent sizes. The author also mentions that these types should be defined in the appropriate header file, although they are unsure which header file that would be dependent on the compiler.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author prefers lowercase for function-like macros instead of ALL_CAPS. They explain that ALL_CAPS in C was originally used for preprocessor macros as a way to signal their presence. The author argues that using ALL_CAPS for constants in other languages doesn't make sense and suggests that shouting should be reserved for more meaningful purposes in programming languages, such as making template pattern variables stand out.

## 8. [Metals Fuse Together in Space](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37814667)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article discusses the phenomenon of cold welding, which occurs when two pieces of similar metals fuse together when they come into contact in a vacuum. In everyday life, this bonding doesn't typically happen because metals are usually covered by an oxide layer that prevents bonding. However, in space where there is no air, the oxide layer doesn't form and cold welding could potentially occur. Astronauts' tools are coated with plastic to minimize the risk of cold welding, although it has still occurred in some cases. The article also mentions that different types of cold welding exist, and some can occur on Earth without a vacuum under specific conditions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a passage from the science fiction novel "Falling Free" by Lois McMaster Bujold. In the passage, a character explains how metal pieces in space become fused together through a process called spontaneous vacuum diffusion welding. This occurs when metal molecules evaporate and bond with neighboring surfaces. The process is faster for pieces exposed to the sun and slower for those in the shade. The character suggests that some of these fused pieces have been in place for twenty years.
