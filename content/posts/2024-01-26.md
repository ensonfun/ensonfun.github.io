**Total comment counts : 33**

### Summary

 The author questions the need for so many vector databases in the current AI era. They wonder if there are enough choices for storing and retrieving vectors. While there are only a few options in other data storage categories, there are dozens of options for vector search. However, the author believes that the challenges of real-world retrieval extend beyond just getting vectors. They include intent classification, inference and reranking, diversity, and lexical retrieval. The author argues that there needs to be a dedicated focus on rethinking retrieval problems, similar to how NoSQL forced a rethink of databases. They predict that more surfaces will be driven by retrieval systems, and the money and effort will flow towards solving the array of problems in this area. In the end, the author suggests that we may end up with new search engines that have more AI/Chat/RAG experiences incorporated into them, similar to SQL incorporating innovations from NoSQL.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author believes that the use of cosine-similarity-search as a service is no longer at its peak and that most people in the field no longer use specialized vector databases for that purpose. The author suggests that a more interesting and longer-lasting product would involve fine-tuning open-source software (OSS) embedding models based on real-world query patterns, as well as storing and recomputing embeddings for data when updating the fine-tuned models. The author argues that average results are not commonly used, as most use cases require specialization such as classification, clustering, or retrieval. The author believes that fine-tuning on specific use cases would outperform general-purpose models, especially with a customized dataset. The author also emphasizes the need for storage and management when regularly fine-tuning new models, as embeddings would need to be recomputed with each deployment. The author expresses willingness to pay for a service that simplifies these processes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues that various types of databases, such as object databases, OLAP, key-value, graph databases, and more, have all been absorbed into traditional relational databases over time. The author believes that this pattern will continue, as traditional databases are constantly evolving and adapting to incorporate new features and advancements. The article suggests that commercial databases, like Oracle, are dominant in the market because they offer a wide range of capabilities and are able to absorb new technologies. Overall, the author believes that it is difficult for smaller, specialized databases to compete in the long term with traditional databases.

## 8. [ArVid: Russians squeezed 4 hard drives into one VHS tape in the 90s](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39140849)

**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 In 1995, post-Soviet Russia faced economic challenges such as high prices and payment in unconventional forms. However, the country also experienced an influx of Western technology, including computers and modems. With limited storage space on their computers, Russians sought affordable solutions. One option was using floppy disks, but they had low storage capacity and were prone to data loss. Another option was purchasing another hard drive, but it was expensive. A local computer store owner named Yevgeni introduced a Russian-made product called the "ArVid" card. This ISA expansion card allowed users to store a large amount of data on a VHS tape using a home VCR. The package included the ArVid ISA Card, floppy disks with software and documentation, and a custom cable for connecting the computer to the VCR. To control the VCR, users needed to teach the ArVid card the infrared remote-control signals of the VCR. It took several hours to complete the setup. Once everything was set up, users could select files using a file navigation program and write them to tape by converting the data into a video signal.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their experience using a custom file navigation program similar to "Norton Commander." They mention a faster alternative called "Volkov Commander" and the memory of uploading it to SIMTEL in 1993. The operator complained about pirating Norton Commander, leading to the author getting booted from a VAX mainframe. Despite this incident, it sparked their interest in social engineering, and they eventually started using Unix and Linux, finding them more useful than VAX/VMS.
