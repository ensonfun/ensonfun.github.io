 The Swiss have implemented a system where contacting an employee on a Sunday results in weekend-rate overtime, even if the communication is just to be dealt with the following week. To address this issue, many companies have systems in place that delay email delivery sent outside of working hours unless authorized and costed. This approach is seen as an economics-based solution to legal problems, often referred to as "if you want to ban it, tax it."

## 6. [Linux Pipes Are Slow](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41348844)

**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The author of the article conducted an experiment to understand why Linux pipes are slower than expected when not using a specific system call called "vmsplice". They wanted to improve the performance of their program for encoding/decoding Morse code, so they examined the difference in performance between solutions that use vmsplice and those that do not. The author speculated that vmsplice allows for faster data transfer by avoiding unnecessary copying to and from kernel space. They measured the throughput of different solutions and found that writing directly to a buffer was significantly faster than writing to a pipe. They then profiled their program and discovered that the system call used for writing to the pipe was the bottleneck. The article concludes with the implication that vectorization is crucial for achieving high throughput and further investigation is needed to understand why writing to a pipe is slower than writing to a buffer.

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Olivetti Programma 101, a revolutionary computer developed by the Italian company Olivetti in the 1960s. Olivetti, known for its typewriters, ventured into the field of electronic calculators and computers under the direction of Adriano Olivetti and his son Roberto. The Programma 101 was a compact "desktop" computer designed to be a personal object that could be used by individuals at their desks. This was a radical departure from the massive mainframe computers of the time. The computer was developed by a team of engineers led by Pier Giorgio Perotto. Initially, the machine was classified as a calculator to circumvent a deal with General Electric that had acquired Olivetti's electronics division. The Programma 101 had limited capabilities compared to modern computers but could perform arithmetic calculations and logical operations. It used a small paper tape printer for visualization and a programmable magnetic card reader/recorder for memory. The computer's electronics were based on transistors and other components, rather than integrated circuits. Overall, the Programma 101 can be seen as a transitional device between calculators and personal computers.

## 10. [Stripe Data vs. Open‐Source Alternatives: A MRR Example](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41350468)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 The founder of Cal.com criticized Stripe for the difficulty of calculating monthly recurring revenue (MRR) using Stripe's API. While Stripe's embedded dashboard is helpful for seed-stage startups, it becomes insufficient as companies grow and desire more data analysis capabilities. Stripe lacks an API route equivalent to /getMRR, making it tough to obtain statistics into one's own warehouse or database. Stripe offers add-ons like Stripe Sigma and Stripe Data Pipeline, but they come at an additional cost per transaction. The fees may not be significant for larger companies, but for those with numerous smaller transactions, such charges can accumulate. Despite its limitations, Stripe Sigma can be used to calculate MRR to some extent. However, both Stripe Sigma and Stripe Data Pipeline are expensive when considering the base fee and transaction-based fees. Stripe's usage-based billing model makes it challenging to track usage-based metrics, unlike other SaaS applications that utilize seat-based metrics. Overall, Stripe's approach to data access and pricing has drawn criticism.

### Top 1 Comment Summary
