## 1. [Everyone knows all the apps on your phone](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43518866)

**Total comment counts : 53**

### Summary

 The article discusses changes in Android's app permissions regarding visibility of other installed apps, implemented since Android 11 in 2022. Developers must now explicitly declare which apps they need to access in their configuration files and can only do so if it's essential for functionality. However, some Indian apps, particularly Swiggy and Zepto, have been found to access an excessive number of other apps on users' devices—154 and 165 apps, respectively—raising privacy concerns. This access appears to be used for user profiling rather than essential functions, which contradicts Play Store’s policies on personal data. The article also mentions that these apps maintain separate lists for their delivery personnel, including monitoring apps related to personal finance and leisure, suggesting intrusive tracking of users' behaviors even during their downtime. In addition, Kreditbee, a personal loan app, reportedly checks for a staggering 860 apps, further highlighting privacy issues in the practices of these companies.

### Summary

 Utah has become the first U.S. state to ban fluoride in public water, with Governor Spencer Cox signing the law effective May 7. The ban follows concerns raised by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy regarding potential health risks associated with fluoride. Critics, including health experts and organizations like the American Dental Association, argue that this decision could negatively impact oral health, particularly for children. The law, introduced by Republican state lawmaker Stephanie Gricius, allows communities to choose whether to add fluoride, citing research on potential cognitive effects in children. Despite the ban, many public health organizations support fluoridation as a means to prevent tooth decay. The move has sparked debate, with some studies suggesting fluoride levels in U.S. water are safe, while most Western European countries do not fluoridate their water.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 A Canadian city eliminated fluoride from its water supply in 2011 but decided to reinstate it a decade later due to poor outcomes observed from the removal. Data indicated negative effects from the absence of fluoride.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses emerging research suggesting a potential link between fluoride in drinking water and slightly lower IQ levels in babies when pregnant mothers consume fluoride. Although there is no significant impact on IQ after birth, the author proposes that fluoride should be removed from water and advises pregnant women to use fluoride-free toothpaste.

## 3. [Self-contained Python scripts with uv](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519669)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 The article discusses how to make a Python script self-contained and executable using the `uv` package. The author is working on a Go project and prefers using the `httpx` package in an IPython REPL for testing a specific API endpoint. To facilitate tests, they write a script (`jam_users.py`) that upserts user data and then opens an IPython REPL for further interaction.

Initially, the author mentions inconvenient methods for running Python scripts that depend on having an appropriate system Python installed. However, after discovering the `uv` package—a tool for creating isolated Python executables—they decided to incorporate its functionalities into their script. By adding special script tags to the header and embedding the `uv` invocation in the shebang line, the author can run the script as a self-contained executable without the need for manual dependency management or system Python modifications. 

This approach allows the author to easily share scripts with others without needing to explain setup steps, as long as those users have `uv` installed. Overall, the article highlights the efficiency and simplicity `uv` brings to Python scripting, especially for complex scripts.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses concerns raised about the "self-contained" nature of a script that requires the installation of the tool "uv." The author points out two main issues: 

1. The script relies on "uv" being already installed, which could complicate its use. While it could be modified to check for "uv" and install it if missing, this would add unnecessary complexity.
2. The script automatically creates a virtual environment (venv) in the user's home directory, which persists even after the script is deleted, leading to potential disk space issues. The author emphasizes that the documentation for "uv" does not mention any automatic cleanup for these temporary environments. 

Overall, the author believes the claim of being "self-contained" does not hold true due to these factors.

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article, written on March 27, 2025, discusses the resolution of a long-standing issue in Rust related to upcasting with supertraits, particularly concerning the `DebugAny` trait's interaction with `Any`. Three years prior, the author shared a workaround to enable this upcasting, as Rust did not allow methods from `Any` to be called on `dyn DebugAny`. As of Rust 1.86, this issue has been fixed, and the casting now works as intended. The update is currently in the beta channel, with a stable release expected soon, allowing developers to retire old hacks. The author expresses gratitude to everyone who contributed to this improvement.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses terminology related to Rust traits, particularly the difference between "inheritance" and "requirement." It clarifies that in Rust, traits do not inherit from one another; rather, one trait can require another. For example, the trait `Bar` can require the trait `Foo`, but this does not mean that `Foo`'s methods are added to `Bar`. Instead, it indicates that a type must implement `Foo` in order to implement `Bar`. While this creates a supertype/subtype relationship in some situations, the article cautions that such framing may not be beneficial for those coming from traditional object-oriented programming backgrounds, as Rust does not follow the same inheritance model.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a significant change regarding the internal representation of a vtable, which now ensures that its supertraits are organized in a predictable manner preceding its own methods. If this arrangement cannot be achieved, a pointer to the relevant vtable is provided, likely to address issues arising from diamond trait inheritance.
