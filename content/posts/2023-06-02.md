## 1. [Radiation-hardened Quine (2014)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36162164)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 The article describes a self-printing program written in Ruby called "robust quine" that works even if one character is deleted from the code. It includes instructions for generating a broken program and running it, and provides three versions of the program, including the latest "ascii-art" version. The program is available for use under the MIT License.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the possibility of a script that can deal with general bit flips rather than just deleting one character randomly. According to the author, radiation typically causes bit flips rather than deleting characters. The chance of a bit flip deleting a character by mutating into 0x7F is 0.9%. The chance of a character mutating into a non-printable character is 8.3%. The chance of a character mutating into an extended ASCII character is 12.5%. The author mentions that there are many possible effects on the interpreter when dealing with these characters, and that control characters could be particularly troublesome. Despite the potential issues, the author concludes that the script is still a cool quine.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article mentions a developer known for creating a 128-language quine relay, in which the languages print a program in the next one, looping back to the original. The project is available on Github.

## 4. [Automatic emergency braking should become mandatory, feds say](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36150845)

**Total comment counts : 47**

### Summary

 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed a rulemaking that would make automatic emergency braking standard in all new light passenger vehicles. The feature, already included in many new vehicles, uses a forward-looking sensor to detect whether a vehicle is slowing down rapidly and alerts the driver to slow down if necessary. NHTSA predicts that the proposed rule would save 360 lives and prevent 24,000 crashes each year. While automatic emergency braking has been shown to be effective, NHTSA wants the standard system to include pedestrian detection, after tests showed that it didn't work well in low light or high speed conditions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author had a bad experience with a brand new car that had a safety feature that almost caused them to get into a serious accident twice. The feature could not be properly disabled and the author is disappointed with the car manufacturer and dealer. They ended up switching cars and now drive a 27-year-old car with no "features". The author suggests that the government should outlaw touchscreens in cars to improve safety.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article is responding to comments referring to automatic transmissions being only for teenagers and elderly individuals, stating that this sort of belief is misguided. The author then shared a personal anecdote about how their Toyota's emergency brake saved their life in a potential accident. The author also received a discount from their insurer when they purchased the car due to the emergency brake feature.

## 5. [It‚Äôs not wrong that "ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è".length == 7 (2019)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36159443)

**Total comment counts : 45**

### Summary

 This article discusses the different ways that programming languages handle the length of strings containing emojis. While JavaScript and Java count emojis as two units, Rust counts emojis as 5 Unicode scalar values (which constitutes a single countable unit), and Swift counts emojis as a single extended grapheme cluster. Python 3's approach to string length is deemed the worst since it allows for surrogate pairs and inherently results in multiple interpretations of the same string. The article delves into the various ways that string length can be computed and stored, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the length of a certain string in Python 3, which is made up of five valid Unicode code units. The author argues that the correct length of the string should be five, not 17, which represents the length in bytes. The author also states that a programming language shouldn't be concerned with how many glyphs it needs to draw until it actually tries to draw them. The article suggests that Python 3's approach is the worst for this reason.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues against "everything you know about X is wrong" articles and criticizes how a particular article creates a false equivalence between UTF-32 code units and UTF-16 code units. While the article acknowledges that grapheme clusters exist and are useful, it argues that comparing these two encoding concepts is misleading. UTF-32 code units represent Unicode code points, a general concept in all Unicode encodings, while UTF-16 code units are an implementation detail specific to UTF-16.

## 8. [The work is never just ‚Äúthe work‚Äù (2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36150105)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of accurately estimating the time and effort required for software development projects and proposes a framework to help improve future estimations. The author shares their personal experience of underestimating a project and the process they went through to understand why the estimation was so far off. They identify common blind spots and challenges, such as not accounting for invisible tasks and complexity. The proposed framework involves breaking down work into before, between, and around the actual development work, and visualizing the overall project lifecycle. The author acknowledges that the framework is not scientific and may not be applicable to all projects, but suggests it can be a useful tool for improving estimation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article outlines five reasons that make estimating difficult. Firstly, people often think they have done something before but have not done it exactly the same way, which can affect how long it takes. Secondly, external factors such as changes in the work environment can impact deliverability. Thirdly, the person who is doing the estimating may have changed, and this can affect how much time things take. Fourthly, estimations can be wrong due to human error. Finally, estimating is a skill that improves over time but cannot account for external factors or human error. The author also expresses frustration when they have a strong feeling about an estimate, but their boss does not believe them and tries to find a better estimate, only to end up with the same result.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article suggests that while estimating a project's cost may lead to fewer failed projects, the amount of time and effort required to create a reliable estimate doubles the project's completion cost. Many developers choose to jump into coding instead of giving up accurate estimates to reduce costs. Unfortunately, businesses only see the overshoot on time, which they incorrectly equate with project cost, rather than the undershoot on budget relative to a fully-planned project.
