**Total comment counts : 24**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of alien minds and how AI can provide insights into how they perceive the world. It explains how neural networks can be modified to create alien AI, and how these modified networks produce mental imagery that diverges from human perception. The article also explores the idea of interconcept space, where images that are statistically reasonable but not easily describable by humans are found. It provides examples of different images generated by AI, both familiar and abstract, and discusses the effects of modifying neural networks on the generated images.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their observations of an AI creating images and how it relates to the concept of dreaming. They describe the constantly changing and blended nature of the AI-generated images, noting that while they have become more cohesive and solid, they still maintain a dreamlike quality. Drawing from their personal experience with lucid dreaming, the author suggests that the images created by AI resemble a person who is dreaming but has some level of control over their dream. They explain that even in lucid dreaming, there is a sense of unconsciousness and the inability to fully control one's thoughts. The AI's current state is likened to this level of unconsciousness, although it has not yet reached a state of full wakefulness. The author acknowledges that AIs are currently incapable of waking up, highlighting the difference between the AI's limitations and the wakefulness that follows a lucid dream.

The guide is primarily focused on software consulting but aims to be applicable in different locations. The chapters are organized in a logical order, but readers are encouraged to skip sections they are already familiar with. The author welcomes feedback and comments.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article advises against setting a low consulting rate, as it tends to attract difficult and demanding clients. Clients who are willing to pay a higher rate are generally more reasonable and less price-focused. It is unlikely that clients who have a purchasing department will allow consultants to raise their rates later on. Consultants often overlook the additional benefits they offer, such as schedule flexibility and avoiding payroll taxes, which should be factored into their pricing. The article suggests that new consultants often underestimate their rates. If a client objects to the rate, it is better to negotiate on the scope of the project rather than lowering the rate. Lastly, the article advises against billing hourly as it is considered problematic.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses setting hourly rates as a consultant. It suggests that initially, it is advisable to offer a lower price, but not too low. The author found that asking for a rate that was fair for them proved beneficial for both parties. Additionally, the author regretted offering a lower rate as it affected their performance.

## 8. [fMRI-to-image with contrastive learning and diffusion priors](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36766700)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article discusses the release of a collaborative paper on MindEye, a state-of-the-art approach to reconstructing and retrieving images from fMRI brain activity. MindEye achieves high performance in image retrieval and reconstruction using a novel approach that combines contrastive learning and a diffusion prior. It can accurately identify the original image viewed by a participant and recreate the image based on fMRI activity. The paper also highlights the potential benefits of reconstructing perception from brain activity in clinical applications and brain-computer interfaces. However, there are limitations, including the need for extensive training data from each participant and the requirement for specific types of training images. The article emphasizes the importance of data protection and transparency in neuroscience research and showcases the open research approach used in developing MindEye. The authors invite interested readers to explore their ongoing projects and join their research community.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a methodology that claims to reconstruct images from brain activity. However, a commenter on Hacker News raises doubts about the validity of the claims. The commenter suggests that the system may have simply overfitted the training images without actually reading images from the brain. The commenter provides evidence from the paper that supports this view. They conclude that the methodology may have cherry-picked coincidences or found similarities among subjects rather than accurately reconstructing images.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect images in the brain and highlights some challenges and limitations in the process. The author suggests that detecting images is relatively easier than other tasks, such as determining the words someone is thinking of. The resolution of fMRI scans, both spatially and temporally, is mentioned as a significant issue. The study mentioned in the article used 1.8mm voxels for spatial resolution and did not specify the temporal frequency, but it showed images to subjects for 3 seconds at a time. The author also mentions that certain brain functions, like vision, are more clearly localized than others, making it easier to detect stimulus in those areas. However, scanning only part of the brain can improve resolution but is only useful for activity in that specific region. The author concludes by expressing excitement about the potential applications of fMRI technology, such as using it to draw people's faces based on their mental imagery.

The co-op currently has 9,000 members, accounting for approximately 15% of the ride-hailing platform driver workforce in NYC. With its driver-centric approach and financial flexibility, The Drivers Cooperative aims to compete with established ride-hailing giants.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that "digital" cooperatives, which involve small companies or individual operators using open source platforms, should be explored further. The inability of these entities to cooperate allows third parties to take over client intermediation and extract large rents. Small businesses and individuals pay high fees to digital platform owners, which far exceed the platform development costs. If independent entities cannot work together to develop digital infrastructure, someone else will do it for them and benefit from it. Reclaiming market ownership of digital tools may be challenging, but there is currently an opportunity for small entities to reclaim agency due to a stagnating phase in technical innovation.

## 10. [Computer memory prototype ditches 1s and 0s for denser data storage](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36763758)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Scientists at Cambridge University have developed a prototype for computer memory that could lead to faster chips capable of storing up to 100 times more data. The memory system, based on resistive switching memory, allows for a continuous range of states to store data, unlike conventional memory that only has two states. The researchers achieved this by using barium bridges between stacked thin films of hafnium oxide, creating a highly structured material that can encode data based on changes in electrical resistance. This type of memory could have promising applications in AI and machine learning. The prototype also has advantages in terms of self-assembly at low temperatures and compatibility with existing manufacturing techniques used in the semiconductor industry. Feasibility studies are underway to explore its potential scalability.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the implementation of the Intel 8087 math coprocessor in 1980. Due to the coprocessor having too much microcode to fit into a standard ROM, a special ROM was used that stored two bits per transistor, utilizing four different transistor sizes. This resulted in an increase in density and each value read from the ROM generated two output bits. The same technique was also employed in the iAPX 432's I/O processor chip.
