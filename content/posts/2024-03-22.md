### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article enjoyed using PICO-8, a retro gaming platform. However, they have now moved on to using "genuine" retro hardware like CX16, Mega65, or Agon Light. These new machines have tighter specifications and can achieve more within those specifications. The author suggests that using Lua, a programming language, might be too slow on real 8-bit hardware, but it can be used as the base for a cross-compiler instead. They propose creating an ultimate development environment that generates precise code for specific types of projects. This approach has been seen in highly optimized PICO-8 games as well as newer demos for platforms like C64, Spectrum, and A800. The "big hardware" is being leveraged to defy assumed paradigms.

## 3. [How Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Helps Neural Networks Compute](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39786666)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 Researchers have discovered that asking language models to generate step-by-step solutions, a technique called chain-of-thought prompting, enables the models to solve complex problems. By using techniques from computational complexity theory, researchers have explored the power of chain-of-thought reasoning to understand the capabilities and limitations of language models. Large language models are built using artificial neural networks that perform operations on strings of numbers representing words. The introduction of transformer networks in 2017 allowed for the scaling up of language models, leading to improved performance.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses their experience with interacting with chain-of-thought and points out that it should not be compared to rigid chains of logic or math. They mention that step-by-step reasoning by models does not provide the same level of rigidity as human logic and math. The strength of the chain lies in the related contexts it considers, which is much weaker than human logic and math. The author argues that AI models do not make the necessary tight connections taught in basic math, and they observe how models fail in ways that humans past a certain age would not. Instead, models search for related contexts, which is powerful but different from human logical reasoning. Humans can reason starting with very few concepts and reach ironclad conclusions, which models are not capable of doing. Models, on the other hand, leapfrog through context. The author acknowledges that it is difficult to describe this succinctly, but it is not hard to see.

 This article explains that transformer models only perform computations when they generate tokens. Generating more tokens using CoT provides more time for the model to think. However, this explanation does not cover all the details.

## 4. [Implementing Vertical Form Controls](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39757394)

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 Safari 17.4 has introduced support for vertical writing mode in form control elements across macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. This feature is particularly useful for East Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Traditional Mongolian, which are written vertically and read top-to-bottom. While vertical writing mode has been available in browsers for some time, support for form controls has been inconsistent. As part of Interop 2023, the industry committed to improving support for vertical writing mode in form controls, and Safari 17.4 now brings this support to all Safari users. Adding vertical form controls is simple with the CSS writing-mode property. Safari supports right-to-left block flow direction with "writing-mode: vertical-rl" and left-to-right block flow direction with "writing-mode: vertical-lr." The supported form control elements include buttons, textarea, progress, meter, input, and select. WebKit is committed to supporting vertical writing modes for any new controls in the future. However, popup UIs associated with form controls, like menus and color pickers, are still displayed horizontally. Implementing vertical writing mode in WebKit required making changes to the user-agent stylesheet and custom layout code. Additionally, rendering form controls with vertical writing mode required unique changes depending on the control and system capabilities. Overall, Safari's inclusion of vertical writing mode support aims to improve internationalization and empower authors to create better content for local and global communities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's fascination with the rethinking of rendering and interaction models for form controls in programming. They mention how this process involves making meaningful changes to long-standing rendering logic. The author expresses curiosity about the extent of code that had to be redone and provides a link to a GitHub commit for further exploration. They comment that the changes include converting heights to logical heights and replacing "Right" with "end," finding the overall process intriguing.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is seeking feedback from East Asian people on the usefulness of a proposed change regarding vertical text orientation. They express concern about potential bugs and developers lacking preparation to handle vertical text correctly. They mention that while vertical orientation may be suitable for poetry or prose, most signs, subtitles, and other elements in Japan, China, and Korea are left-to-right. They question the introduction of an antiquated custom to override past imperial influences from Russia and China. The author is open to hearing from native individuals on this matter and does not want to come across as ignorant or xenophobic.

## 9. [Meteorite Self-test check-list](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39784355)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 This article explains the formation and characteristics of fusion crusts on meteorites. When small rocks from space, called meteoroids, enter Earth's atmosphere at high speeds, the air in their path becomes compressed and heats up, causing the outer layer of the meteoroid to melt. This molten material ablates, or sloughs off, and is replaced by new molten material underneath. As a result, the meteoroid loses most of its mass and forms a thin, glassy coating called a fusion crust. Fusion crusts are usually 1-2 mm thick and can have flow features or regmaglypts. The process of atmospheric entry also shapes the meteorite into a rounded and aerodynamic shape. Fusion crusts remain shiny even after being on Earth for a long time, although in temperate environments where it rains frequently, they may not be as shiny. The fusion crust is made of glass, while the underlying material is crystalline and sometimes weaker. Therefore, fusion crusts may break away over time, which helps in identifying them as meteorites.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 10. [Why is it so hard to build an airport?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39789920)

**Total comment counts : 44**

### Summary

 Airports are crucial for economic activity and air travel, with aviation contributing to 8% of global GDP and 25% of companies' sales relying on air transport. However, building airports is challenging and often met with opposition. Despite the increasing demand for air travel, the US has only built three major commercial airports in the past 50 years. The difficulty in building airports stems from various factors, including opposition from interest groups and the need for extensive infrastructure to accommodate jet aircraft. Jet airliners require longer runways and produce louder noise, which has been a major concern for residents near airports. Despite efforts to educate and promote acceptance of aircraft noise, building airports that can accommodate jet aircraft remains a challenge.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that Narita Airport (NRT) in Tokyo is located quite far from the city. While violence is uncommon in modern Japan, the airport has been the site of resistance over several decades. This includes opposition forces killing police officers, rioting on multiple occasions, and constructing a 200 ft tower to interfere with test flights. Numerous acts of vandalism have occurred at the airport over the years. The article provides a link for more information.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the debate surrounding the location of the "next" airport in the Seattle region. It mentions that there is a general consensus that nobody wants a new airport. The State Legislature created a commission to identify potential sites, but due to strong public opposition, they submitted their final report without making any specific recommendations. One idea that has been proposed is to build a high-speed rail to Moses Lake Airport in Central Washington and expand it. However, the author expresses doubt that this will happen as it would involve constructing both a major airport and a new train.
