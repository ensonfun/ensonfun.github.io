## 2. [Show HN: I made a HTMX Playground 100% in the browser](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38906989)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The HTMX Playground is a code sandbox that allows users to experiment with HTMX. It eliminates the need for any setup and provides examples adapted from htmx.org. The sandbox functions as a backend-like environment within the browser, where users can define endpoints and render their own templates. It runs a mock server that intercepts outgoing requests from HTMX. The project is not limited to HTMX, and users can explore other libraries. The code is available on GitHub. It should be noted that while server.js can be stateful, any updates to the state in the on.get("/") view will be lost because the initial page load is obtained in a separate iframe before updating the on-screen iframe.

The author is worried about the complexity of using HTMX and the potential for spaghetti code. They ask if HTMX has considered these concerns and how they address them.

## 3. [MotorOS: a Rust-first operating system for x64 VMs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38907568)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of feedback and states that they carefully consider all input from users. They also mention that documentation is available for more information about available qualifiers.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a Rust-first operating system called Motor OS. This means that not only the kernel and the drivers are implemented in Rust, but also userspace programs can be written in Rust. While it is technically possible to write apps for Motor OS in C by reverse-engineering the Rust-based ABI and toolchain, it requires additional work. Standard Rust programs, on the other hand, can be compiled and run without any issues. This Rust-first approach is considered unique compared to other operating systems like Redox that use C-based kernel ABI.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article acknowledges two main concerns raised in the comments: long-term viability and support, as well as issues regarding compilers and binary compatibility. The author believes that despite these concerns, the potential benefits of the Motor OS project (or a similar project) will lead to the development of a widely used new operating system. The author also addresses concerns about compiler instability and binary compatibility, stating that the Linux kernel can be compiled with different toolchains and still run old binaries. The author expresses gratitude for the comments and offers to answer further questions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the usefulness of the Crane tool and the go-containerregistry library for image and layer manipulation. It explains that Crane allows users to add new layers, edit metadata, flatten images with multiple layers into a single layer, and rebase images onto updated base images. These operations can be performed directly in the registry without the need for Docker, although Docker is still useful for creating the original image.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes how the author found a tool called "dive" to be very helpful in understanding the workings of Docker images and how to write efficient Dockerfiles. They found that simply reading the documentation was not enough, but actually making changes to the Dockerfile and observing how it affected the resulting layer structure helped them gain a better understanding of Docker.

## 6. [Visualizing Ext4](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38907821)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The author of the article explores the process of creating an ext4 filesystem and visualizing its structure. They initially experiment with a live drive but opt for using a regular file as a loop device instead. They compare the output of a blank file with an ext4 filesystem, noting the added structure. To differentiate between ext4 data and user data, they create a 1024-byte file from /dev/urandom and color code the corresponding pixels in their visualization. They also create an animated GIF showing the repeated copying of the user data file to the drive. Overall, the author finds the visualization and animation of the ext4 filesystem interesting and satisfying.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article is about a graphical visualization of the ext4 file system, which was presented at the FOSDEM conference. The visualization starts at around 20 minutes into the video provided in the article. The author also mentions that there is another video on their blog that correctly renders the colors used in the visualization.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that when trying to simplify using a computer, it often misses the opportunity to be educational and spark curiosity. The author gives an example of how the old red hard drive light on computers used to inform and engage users, such as indicating when a game was loading. The author suggests that a good compromise would be to hide the advanced view but keep it accessible for curious individuals who may become the next generation of computer enthusiasts.

 The article discusses the phrase "1 in a million chance" and explores examples that could fit this probability. It examines events such as winning the lottery, experiencing a major earthquake, and becoming the President of the United States. The article also touches on analyzing risks to individuals, considering factors like the number of deaths and the time spent engaging in specific activities. The concept of micromort, representing a 1 in a million chance of death, is mentioned as well.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article talks about the concept of million-to-one chances, where something highly unlikely is believed to have a small probability of happening. It humorously suggests that in fiction, when someone mentions a million-to-one chance, it is almost certain to succeed. The example from Terry Pratchett's book, "Guards! Guards!" is mentioned, where characters attempt various unlikely circumstances to increase their odds of success. The article further discusses the difficulty of achieving exactly one-in-a-million probabilities.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of extraordinary evidence and uses an example of someone's name being "Mark Xu" to illustrate the idea. The author explains that although the prior odds of someone having the name "Mark Xu" are low, if a person confidently claims that their name is "Mark Xu", it can be considered as strong evidence. The article emphasizes the notion that extraordinary evidence may be more common than people may believe.

## 8. [Why Aren't We Sieve-Ing?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38911740)

**Total comment counts : 20**

### Summary

 This article discusses the recent advancements in cache eviction algorithms by researchers Juncheng Yang, Yazhuo Zhang, K. V. Rashmi, and Yao Yue. The author specifically highlights their eviction algorithm called SIEVE, which determines which cached items to remove when new ones need to be added. SIEVE outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of miss ratio, making it highly effective. What sets SIEVE apart is its simplicity and similarity to a basic FIFO queue, requiring minimal changes to the existing structure. The article raises the question of why SIEVE wasn't discovered earlier, to which the authors hypothesize that its lack of scan resistance might have contributed to its oversight. The article concludes by suggesting the possibility of developing more scan-resistant approaches to cache eviction, such as SIEVE-k.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that the choice of eviction policy depends on the application behavior. It recommends using profiling against actual data from service logs to find the right answer. The author believes that the difference between miss rates is not significant and suggests using LRU or LFU based on intuition about usage. The author also expresses a positive attitude towards newly proposed algorithms and considers them to be helpful additions to the available tools.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author expresses their enthusiasm for the subject of the article, which discusses the LRU (Least Recently Used) approach in relation to cache algorithms. They admit to having a longstanding belief in the effectiveness of LRU, but also acknowledge the value of theoretical and empirical research that challenges this belief.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 In the early days of computers, a large and advanced computer called TX2 was designed at MIT's Lincoln laboratory. It included a register that was meant to yield truly random numbers through radioactive material and Geiger counters. However, this turned out to be a disaster as the randomness made it impossible to debug programs since it never ran the same way twice. As a result, traditional random number generators were considered better, and this idea was abandoned and has not reappeared since.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issue of balancing random interactions with gameplay in AAA games. The author suggests a simple solution for generating random events, similar to a random walk, where each event of being grabbed by a zombie is based on a random chance that is initialized after a certain amount of time. The author's solution was initially laughed off by other AAA game developers, but their game had market validation with over 10 million downloads. The solution made the game more fun and eliminated frustrating interactions. The article also mentions the addition of support for players to jump or shake to get out of a grab. The article points out that random gameplay can negatively impact enjoyment and provides other solutions to random placement and random interaction problems.
