**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article discusses a set of principles for user interface design, derived from experience and refined over three decades. These principles include maintaining consistency in actions, terminology, and design elements throughout the interface, recognizing the needs of diverse users, providing feedback for every user action, organizing sequences of actions into groups, designing interfaces to prevent serious errors and offer simple recovery instructions, making actions reversible, prioritizing user control and familiarity, and considering the limitations of human information processing. These principles are intended to enhance users' productivity, competence, mastery, and sense of control over the system.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of performance in a user interface (UI) design, stating that a poorly performing UI goes against design principles. It also points out that an unstable UI, particularly found in smart TVs, is problematic as it frequently changes the home screen layout and app icons. Additionally, the author expresses frustration with unlabeled icons, noting that they make it difficult to understand the UI without external help.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Consistency is crucial for good software design, and it's not just about color or fonts. Instead, it's about allowing users to become experts in using the software. Microsoft Office is an example of a software that people pride themselves on knowing well because they can easily navigate between its applications. Similarly, the author feels the same way about Vim, a text editor. Both Office and Vim are stable and consistent, which helps users understand and navigate them effectively.

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of feedback and states that they value and take input from their users seriously. It also mentions the availability of qualifiers and directs readers to their documentation for more information.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the concept of "Rust-first" in the context of the Motor OS operating system. "Rust-first" means that both the kernel and drivers of Motor OS are implemented in Rust, and Rust is the first and currently the only language that userspace programs can be written in. While it is technically possible to reverse-engineer the Rust-based ABI and use the Rust toolchain to write apps for Motor OS in languages like C, it requires additional work. However, standard Rust programs can be compiled and run without any issues. The Rust-first approach taken by Motor OS is considered unique, as other operating systems like Redox use a C-based kernel ABI and relibc as the glue.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the project expresses gratitude for the article and comments. There are two main concerns raised: long-term viability and support, and issues with compilers and binary compatibility. The author believes that, despite these concerns, the potential benefits of the Motor OS project will lead to its widespread use. The author also addresses concerns about compiler instability and binary compatibility, stating that the latest Linux kernel can be compiled with different toolchains and still run old binaries. The author thanks everyone for their comments and offers to answer more questions.

## 10. [Cells across the body talk to each other about aging](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38917749)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 New research has revealed that mitochondrial damage in brain cells triggers a repair response that extends the lifespan of organisms. The study suggests that cellular communication between tissues, specifically through mitochondria, plays a crucial role in regulating aging. Researchers found that damage to mitochondria in the brain of worms led to a repair response that extended the lifespan of the worms by 50%. Furthermore, this communication system involved cells in the germline. The findings shed new light on the link between fertility and aging. Mitochondria are now understood to function as cellular walkie-talkies, sending messages throughout the body that influence the survival and lifespan of the entire organism. This discovery adds to the growing understanding of how aging occurs at a molecular level.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses how the quality of eggs or sperm in worms declines as they age, which is referred to as the ticking of a biological clock. The decline is also seen in the germ cells' ability to transmit signals from the brain's mitochondria. As the worms grow older, the transmission of repair signals becomes less effective, resulting in the decline of their bodies. Although it is unknown if these findings apply to humans, the hypothesis aligns with an evolutionary perspective. As long as germ cells are healthy, they send pro-survival signals to ensure the host organism survives for reproduction. However, as germ cell quality declines, there is no evolutionary reason to extend lifespan. The effect of castration on this mechanism remains unclear.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that mitochondria play a much larger role in our overall health than we may realize. While no sources are provided, the author believes that mitochondria are relevant to various aspects such as the structure of the organism, wound healing, brain function, apoptosis, and several other conditions. The article also mentions that mitochondria are implicated in numerous diseases and conditions, going beyond their traditional role as the "powerhouse of the cell" for ATP production.
