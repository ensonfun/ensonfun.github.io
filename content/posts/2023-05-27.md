## 1. [Building a Personal VoIP System](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36092718)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article is a guide for setting up a digital telephone system using open-source tools such as Asterisk. It provides an overview of the Session Initialization Protocol (SIP) and how it works in local and external networks. The article suggests a solution to the problem of network address translation (NAT) in external networks by configuring a fixed RTP port range on each of the SIP devices and creating static port forwarding rules on the router for each device. The article also provides information on selecting and configuring VoIP phones, subscribing to VoIP services, and editing configuration files for Asterisk on RHEL-based distributions.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes how the author installed a VoIP system using a Raspberry Pi 1 (possibly a Pi 2) with RasPBX, six Cisco VoIP phones, and an external HDD for a small to medium enterprise. The system ran smoothly for years and was still in use when the enterprise was sold. The author emphasizes that setting up a similar system is not difficult and can be done by finding a provider for a SIP trunk, configuring the system, and backing up the configuration.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article describes the author's positive experience working with FreeSWITCH, an alternative to Asterisk for building residential voip services. They found it to be more developer-friendly due to its ability to build dial plans and implement logic using JavaScript or Lua, making it easier to configure and extend than Asterisk. The author successfully prototyped and completed the project using FreeSWITCH and believes the system is still running.

## 4. [Raspberry Pi/PlatformIO conflict blocks support for Pico-Arduino toolchain](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36090536)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 The article discusses a disagreement between PlatformIO and Raspberry Pi Trading over the latter's support for the Raspberry Pi platform on the former's ecosystem. PlatformIO requires licensing fees to be paid by hardware vendors seeking access to its ecosystem. Raspberry Pi Trading did not pay such fees, leading to the rejection of their support for the Raspberry Pi platform. Some community members have criticized PlatformIO for this decision, arguing that it contradicts the company's "open-core" business model and the notion of an open-source community. Nonetheless, PlatformIO stands by its decision and its need to sustainably scale its business.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The Raspberry Pi Foundation received a proposal from PlatformIO Labs, but was unable to justify paying the substantial recurring fees involved and indicated they would not be proceeding. The PlatformIO team's responses have come across as written by lawyers and PR people, leading the commenter to decide to steer clear of PlatformIO in the future.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses using the Raspberry Pi Pico with Arduino through a community port called arduino-pico, which has good USB-Midi support. The author notes that while Arduino can be confusing as a package manager, the patch to use PlatformIO is supposed to make it more user-friendly, and provides instructions on how to do so. The author also expresses a preference for using a language with a real package manager, rather than Arduino or PlatformIO's embedded-only implementations.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The owner of a free service called jsonip.com expressed frustration when someone added their service to a widely used version of Dalvik/Android software, causing a 300% increase in traffic overnight. This increase in traffic, which the owner had never planned for and struggled to manage, was due to a misconfiguration in a squid proxy. The owner had to switch to Cloudflare to handle the load and block the offending traffic, but found that Cloudflare doesn't properly route IPv4 addresses. The owner is asking the person responsible for the misconfiguration to remove their service address from their outdated TV/smart device Android code.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article uses the phrase "I'm a teapot" as a response when they encounter a specific error during testing. This error occurs when a test passes a post request without a CSRF token, which means that the author forgot to add a CSRF token to a form. The phrase is used tongue-in-cheek to signify that the error is intentional and occurs only under certain conditions that the author has programmed.

## 6. [Admiral Rickover's 'Paper Reactor' Memo (1953)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36080015)

**Total comment counts : 11**

### Summary

 Admiral Hyman Rickover, in his 1953 piece, discusses how people who are nonspecialists in the technical aspects of reactors make decisions about future development of atomic power, and how they are faced with confusion and unresolved conflicts in the reactor industry. Rickover explains that this confusion arises from failure to distinguish between the academic and practical aspects of the reactor business and can be resolved by defining those characteristics that differentiate the academic from the practical. He concludes by stating that while it is probably impossible to have reactor ideas labeled as practical or academic, those in high places must make wise decisions based on the facts presented in both categories.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that readers may also enjoy an essay on engineering management titled "Doing a Job" by Rickover. A link to the essay is given.

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of maintaining long-lasting relationships, both personal and professional, and suggests that they often fail due to the accumulation of small conflicts or "scar tissue" over time. The author emphasizes the importance of resolving conflicts without lingering animosity to prevent scar tissue from forming, and warns against the pitfalls of being too nice or too argumentative in relationships. The key to successful relationships is communication and compromise, but it is a difficult task to accomplish.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author's ex, a relationship therapist, encouraged open communication and sharing feelings early in the relationship to prevent the buildup of resentment. Although it initially freaked the author out, they adopted the practice in future relationships, leading to personal growth and the ability to confront problems head-on. Sharing feelings early on can be vulnerable and difficult, but it can prevent future issues and is a sign of maturity.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author believes that actively working on a relationship with empathy and a willingness to improve oneself can lead to a stronger bond. Scar tissue from past disagreements can actually make relationships stronger if conflicts can be resolved constructively. However, this requires effort and compatibility from both parties.

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 The IRIX community is attempting to revive the outdated and much-loved operating system IRIX that was developed by Silicon Graphics Inc in the late 1990s. Despite being proprietary and not actively developed for the past two decades, IRIX continues to attract a dedicated community of collectors and enthusiasts. The SGI community has initiated a crowdfunding campaign to reverse-engineer the IRIX 5.3 kernel, the last version of the system capable of running on the widest variety of machines, with the goal of creating an open-source IRIX-derivative called IRIX-32 for emulation and driver development purposes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article describes how SGI hardware had a distinct aesthetic appeal which set it apart from ordinary PCs, making it recognizable as a higher-end "workstation." However, the article notes that the software, IRIX, did not have the same level of visual appeal as the hardware and was less attractive compared to OS/2.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article expresses surprise that Apple, of all companies, is now the last commercial UNIX workstation vendor, whereas in the 90s, people would have predicted that companies like Sun or SGI would hold that position.

## 10. [The Birth of the Self](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36074664)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 Andrea Wulf's new book Magnificent Rebels: The First Romantics and the Invention of the Self explores philosopher's (including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel) time in the small German university town of Jena, in the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar, during the years between the onset of the French Revolution and the town’s devastation by Napoleon’s armies in 1806. Wulf argues that the proximity of this group of ambitious thinkers helped birth Romanticism and changed the way Germans thought about freedom, individuality, and the role of the state. Between 1789 and 1807, Schiller, Goethe, Hegel, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Alexander von Humboldt and his brother Wilhelm, the Schlegel brothers, Friedrich and August Wilhelm, Friedrich Hölderlin, Novalis and Friedrich Schelling all lived in the town. With its university controlled by four different dukes with no one in charge, Jena offered a level of freedom of thought not matched elsewhere in Germany.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The BBC series "The Century of the Self" by Adam Curtis explores the untold and controversial story of the growth of the mass-consumer society in Britain and the United States. The series questions whether the triumph of the self, seen by many as the ultimate expression of democracy, is really in the interests of the people, and how it was created.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author, a Buddhist, meditates on the question of when the personal self is born. They suggest that it does not exist at birth and only develops after language is learned, manifesting as the chattering ego that is constantly focused on the past or future. They argue that the ego is an illusion that can lead to negative emotions and contribute to violence among human beings. The author believes that the "take what I want" attitude may stem from the unnoticed ego illusion.
