 The author of the article has a philosophical objection to distributing software in binary form, preferring instead to distribute it in source code. They believe that compiling software is usually fast enough and that the reliance on binary distribution is due to an over-reliance on external dependencies. The author also argues that even in the rare case of not having a C compiler available, they would still prefer to compile the software with a standards-compliant C compiler themselves and then transfer the binary to the machine without a compiler.

## 3. [Malaysia started mandating ISPs to redirect DNS queries to local servers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41471510)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) has instructed Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to redirect DNS traffic that uses third-party DNS servers back to their own servers. This is to ensure users benefit from the protection provided by local ISPs and to make malicious sites inaccessible. MCMC has blocked over 24,000 websites since 2018, with online gambling and pornography being the largest categories. MCMC emphasizes that their measures are for the protection of vulnerable groups and that the DNS system can block access to harmful sites and filter inappropriate content. Some users use third-party DNS servers for faster speeds and increased privacy, but these may not have the same level of protection for harmful content compared to local ISPs. MCMC clarifies that legitimate websites are not affected by the DNS redirection, and users are encouraged to report any difficulties accessing legitimate sites directly to their ISPs. Websites that believe they have been unfairly targeted can file an appeal through established channels. MCMC aims to maintain a safe and secure online environment while ensuring seamless access to legitimate content. In addition, MCMC will introduce a new regulatory framework for safe internet use by children and families, starting from January 1, 2025.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article refutes the claim that the measure taken by MCMC is draconian and emphasizes that Malaysia's implementation aims to protect vulnerable groups from harmful online content. The author also implies a skeptical attitude towards such justifications, suggesting that similar claims are often made in the beginning of such measures.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses Malaysia's implementation of internet censorship, which focuses on protecting vulnerable groups from harmful online content. The author questions the justification for such censorship, specifically mentioning pornography and copyright infringement as examples of content that may not necessarily harm anyone. The author draws a parallel to their own country, Russia, where internet censorship started with the aim of protecting children from suicide and drugs but gradually expanded to cover more and more content. They mention that accessing the internet without using a VPN or other anti-censorship measures is difficult in Russia due to the extensive censorship measures implemented.

## 4. [Natural Piezoelectric Effect May Build Gold Deposits](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41438262)

**Total comment counts : 6**

### Summary

 A group of Australian researchers have proposed a hypothesis that explains how natural processes create large chunks of gold. They suggest that an earthquake-triggered piezoelectric effect electroplates gold onto quartz crystals. Orogenic gold deposits, which account for around 75% of gold obtained by humanity, form in areas where two rock bodies are moving past each other. These areas are often filled with hot hydrothermal fluids that increase the solubility of gold. Quartz, being the only abundant mineral that is piezoelectric, generates a charge when placed under strain. This charge can drive redox reactions in nearby fluids, causing gold to come out of solution and depositing it onto the quartz surface. The researchers conducted experiments by putting quartz crystals in a solution containing gold and subjecting them to strain. They found that gold deposits formed on the quartz crystals, supporting their hypothesis.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests using a quartz crystal array and electricity to capture gold from ocean water. However, it does not provide any further details or information.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the idea of extracting gold using large voltage sources placed on rocks in the absence of quartz.

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses some of the new language features in the upcoming C++26 version of the C++ standard. It mentions that in C++11, functions can be declared as deleted to prevent their use, and in C++26, a reason for the deletion can be specified. It also explains that in C++26, an unnamed variable can be defined using a single underscore (_) instead of assigning a name. This automatically adds the [[maybe_unused]] attribute to the declaration. The article further discusses the ability to declare structure bindings in the condition of if, while, or for statements, which was not possible before C++26. Lastly, it mentions that in C++26, the second parameter of static_assert can be a user-generated string-like object.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author discusses several points about C++ that are often overlooked. First, they state that if you are working with a large C++ code base, it is not practical or easy to switch to a different language like Rust. The transition would be expensive and time-consuming. Second, they highlight that new features are added to C++ based on user demand and to address problems in the language. The author appreciates these additions as solutions to long-standing issues. Finally, they acknowledge that C++ is not a perfect language and express a preference for Rust, but still recognize the value of C++ and its supportive community.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 This article discusses the history of dance notation systems and their importance in documenting and preserving dance movements. The author mentions Pierre Beauchamp-Feuillet's system, which was commonly used in 18th century Europe, and Vladimir Ivanovich Stepanov's system, which was based on anatomical analysis of human movement. The article also mentions the Benesh notation, created by Joan and Rudolf Benesh in the 1950s, which is widely used by choreographers in the ballet world today. Additionally, Labanotation, developed by Rudolf Laban in 1928, is discussed as another significant dance notation system. The article concludes by highlighting the Sergeyev Collection, which contains the first ballet scores of famous ballets and is a valuable historical source.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses choreography notation systems and their relevance in the modern age. While these systems have historical value, they have become less important with the advent of video technology. Unlike music, where notation is widely used, dance, especially ballet, has been primarily passed down through oral tradition. Therefore, very few people in the dance world can read or understand choreography notation systems. These systems are mostly utilized by dance historians or those coaching copyrighted works from deceased choreographers. Even before video, they were not widely used like music notation.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a writing system called SignWriting, which is used for sign languages. Unlike other systems developed by linguists, SignWriting was created by a dance instructor who drew inspiration from existing notation systems. SignWriting includes detailed notations for orientation and movement, similar to a phonetic alphabet. The system offers both a precise transcription with specific details of every movement, as well as a more abstract transcription that assumes fluency and allows the reader to fill in missing information.
