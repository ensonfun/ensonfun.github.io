## 5. [Drug trio found to block tumour resistance in pancreatic cancer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46812159)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 A preclinical study from Spain’s National Cancer Research Centre shows a triple-targeted drug combo can cause complete and lasting regression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by simultaneously inhibiting RAF1 (downstream), EGFR (upstream), and STAT3 (parallel) KRAS signaling. In orthotopic mouse models, tumors regressed and growth stopped for over 200 days, with similar results in engineered mice and patient-derived xenografts. The regimen was well tolerated, suggesting potential for clinical trials to overcome PDAC resistance, though human studies are still required.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether promising pancreatic cancer therapies shown in mice or early-stage research can translate to humans and how to balance urgent patient hope with scientific and regulatory caution.
- Concern: The main worry is that hype around preclinical results could mislead patients, encourage unsafe use of unproven treatments, or divert attention from the slow, rigorous process required to prove benefit in humans.
- Perspectives: Views range from advocating rapid, compassionate consideration of experimental compounds to cautioning against hype, highlighting the lengthy, costly path of clinical trials and the limitations of mouse models.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [Compressed Agents.md > Agent Skills](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46809708)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 Researchers tested AI coding agents for Next.js 16 tasks using two approaches: Skills (prompts, tools, and version-matched docs) and AGENTS.md (a persistent in-project docs index). They built a Next.js docs skill and an AGENTS.md index and evaluated them. Results showed many agents didn't use the skill, yielding no improvement over baseline (53% pass). An explicit instruction to trigger the skill raised pass rate to 79%, but wording mattered: "MUST invoke" worsened context, while "explore first, then invoke" improved outcomes. An 8KB AGENTS.md index achieved 100% pass, showing embedded docs' value and instruction fragility.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on AI agents' use of "skills" and documentation, how reliably they are tested, and what future model improvements might change this.
- Concern: The main worry is that agents are inconsistent and may ignore available documentation or skills, leading to unreliable performance and inefficiency.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from optimism that skills will improve with newer models and training, to criticisms of testing methodology and efficiency concerns, to speculation that smaller, cheaper models with better context handling will dominate.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [OTelBench: AI struggles with simple SRE tasks (Opus 4.5 scores only 29%)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46811588)

**Total comment counts : 32**

### Summary

 Researchers evaluated 14 frontier LLMs on OpenTelemetry instrumentation tasks (23 tasks across 11 languages) using the open-source OTelBench benchmark built with the Harbor framework. Best performers were Claude 4.5 Opus (~29%), GPT-5.2 (~26%), and Gemini 3 Pro (~19%). All models struggled with correct distributed tracing, often producing malformed traces or failing to propagate context, sometimes treating multiple user activities as a single trace. The benchmark cost about $522 in LLM tokens across 966 runs. The study highlights that current models still cannot reliably instrument production-grade, multi-service systems.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread critiques the OTELBench OpenTelemetry AI benchmark, arguing it is confusing, poorly aligned with real SRE work, and unlikely to meaningfully assess AI tracing abilities.
- Concern: The main worry is that vague instructions, library-specific requirements, and reliance on up-to-date docs or tooling will yield inconsistent results and misstate AI capabilities.
- Perspectives: Views range from strong skepticism about AI handling multi-service instrumentation to calls for more realistic tasks and benchmarks, with some tempered optimism that structured context and documentation access could improve AI SRE tooling.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
