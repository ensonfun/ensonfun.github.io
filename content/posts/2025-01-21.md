## 1. [Reverse engineering Call of Duty anti-cheat](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42774221)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 The article details a reverse engineer's analysis of the anti-cheat system in "Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War," referred to as TAC (Treyarch Anti-Cheat). Here are the key points:

- **Anti-Cheat Overview**: Unlike newer Call of Duty titles, Black Ops Cold War uses a user-mode anti-cheat system (TAC) without kernel-mode components. TAC is integrated directly into the game's executable and does not utilize kernel drivers.

- **Protection Methods**: The game employs Arxan, an obfuscation tool, which complicates reverse engineering by protecting the game's code. TAC also terminates the process if debug artifacts are detected, and it uses basic hook detection for specific API calls it uses.

- **Detection Techniques**: TAC checks for hooking in APIs it uses, not all APIs, focusing on those critical for its operation. It also has methods to detect external cheating tools like overlays, which might draw on the screen or alter the game window.

- **Bypassing Detection**: The author explains how one might bypass TAC's detection, like using debug registers for hooking since Arxan's protection does not cover these. He also mentions alternative hooking methods that do not involve code patching, which Arxan would detect.

- **Advanced Detections**: TAC has advanced techniques to terminate the game process if tampering is suspected, including setting specific register values and jumping to null addresses, making recovery difficult.

- **Technical Details**: The article includes pseudocode and explanations of how TAC resolves API calls through runtime hashing, providing insights into how one might cache and resolve these calls for analysis or cheating purposes.

Overall, the article serves as both an educational piece on anti-cheat systems in gaming and a cautionary tale about the arms race between game developers and cheaters. The author clarifies that the intent is not to promote cheating but to share knowledge about security in game development.

## 2. [0-click deanonymization attack targeting Signal, Discord, other platforms](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42780816)

**Total comment counts : 66**

### Summary

 The article discusses a 0-click deanonymization attack discovered by Daniel, a 15-year-old high school junior. Here's a summary:

- **Discovery**: Daniel found a method to determine a user's location within a 250-mile radius by exploiting the caching system of Cloudflare, a widely used Content Delivery Network (CDN).

- **Mechanism**: The attack leverages Cloudflare's caching feature where data is stored in datacenters close to users to speed up content delivery. If an attacker can make a user's device load a resource from a Cloudflare-backed site, they can identify which datacenter cached the resource, thus revealing the user's approximate location.

- **Vulnerability**: This method can affect users of apps like Signal, Discord, and Twitter if those apps are compromised or if the attack is executed via a background application. The attack does not require user interaction, making it particularly insidious.

- **Execution**: Daniel utilized a loophole in Cloudflare's system to send requests to specific datacenters, bypassing their usual anycast routing which directs traffic to the nearest datacenter. He developed a tool named Cloudflare Teleport to facilitate this.

- **Outcome**: The vulnerability allowed for precise location tracking without the user's knowledge. Cloudflare eventually patched this vulnerability, rendering the tool obsolete.

- **Purpose of Publication**: Daniel published his findings as a warning to journalists, activists, and others who might be targets for such attacks, highlighting the potential for undetectable surveillance.

This article serves as an alert to the security community about the potential misuse of widely trusted infrastructure like Cloudflare for deanonymization purposes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how Signal, a messaging app known for its privacy features, uses Cloudflare to manage image distribution. When a user sends a picture, it is fetched through Cloudflare and stored in a cache at a data center close to the recipient. This allows one to check the cache status and identify which data center was used. The author notes that while this isn't significant "deanonymization" unless the user is geographically isolated, it's still an interesting aspect of how Signal's infrastructure operates.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses misconceptions about the anonymity of messaging apps like Signal and Discord:

1. **Anonymity vs. Privacy**: The author points out that neither Signal nor Discord are anonymous platforms. Signal claims it cannot read your messages due to encryption, but this does not equate to anonymity. Discord might not even make such claims.

2. **Pseudonymity**: At best, these platforms offer weak pseudonymity, where users can operate under usernames not directly linked to their real identities, but this is far from true anonymity.

3. **Security Features**: Features like auto-loading media are criticized for prioritizing user convenience over security, making them susceptible to deanonymization attacks.

4. **Tracking Techniques**: The article mentions that even basic techniques like tracking pixels are still effective in compromising user anonymity.

5. **Advice for Anonymity**: The author suggests that for real anonymity, one should avoid platforms like Discord, Signal, and even Hacker News (HN). They recommend more extreme measures like using automated systems through privacy-focused operating systems like Whonix, avoiding JavaScript, and using local language models to rephrase messages.

6. **Conclusion**: The overarching message is that true anonymity is practically non-existent in today's digital landscape, emphasizing that users should not rely on mainstream messaging apps for anonymity.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses changes in the audience demographics of Hacker News (HN). The core group of startup enthusiasts and entrepreneurs remains, but the community has expanded to include a larger proportion of people generally interested in tech topics rather than specifically startups. The author doubts that the *zeitgeist* or general spirit of the times is the reason for this shift and expresses a desire for objective analysis on how recent events like the Twitter and Reddit controversies might have influenced these changes. Additionally, the author notes an increase in off-topic stories, which they feel detract from the original focus of HN, although they still find the site worthwhile.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the evolving perception and strategy of starting a business. Traditionally, the goal was to create a company that produces desirable products for sustained growth over decades, focusing on long-term stability rather than a quick exit strategy like selling the company for a huge profit shortly after inception, a model popularized during the dotcom boom. The author points out that the startup culture which emphasized rapid scaling and selling at a high valuation was never sustainable and essentially served as a recruitment funnel for big tech companies looking to acquire innovative teams rather than just the technology. Today, there's a shift back towards building companies for long-term success, with an understanding that while quick successes can still happen, the effort to create these "shooting stars" often results in wasted resources. The advice is to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities when they present themselves but also to consider the stability and benefits of a regular salary if long-term entrepreneurial efforts do not pay off.
