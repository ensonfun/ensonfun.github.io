## 6. [Eliminating Memory Safety Vulnerabilities at the Source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41650647)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 Memory safety vulnerabilities pose significant risks to software security. Google advocates for a "Safe Coding" approach, emphasizing the transition to memory-safe languages to reduce these vulnerabilities over time. This shift has shown promising results, notably in Android, where the percentage of memory safety vulnerabilities decreased from 76% to 24% over six years. 

The article highlights an important principle: vulnerabilities decay over time, with newer code being more prone to issues. This means that as new development moves towards memory-safe languages, the overall number of vulnerabilities in the codebase can actually drop, even if the total amount of code written in memory-unsafe languages increases. 

Data from 2024 indicates a continued decline in memory safety vulnerabilities, despite much of the codebase remaining memory unsafe, suggesting that older code tends to have lower vulnerability densities. The trend aligns with efforts starting around 2019 to prioritize memory-safe languages amid rising costs and complexities associated with managing memory safety issues.

Historically, the industry’s strategies have evolved from reactive patching to proactive mitigations, but scalable and sustainable solutions are still necessary. As memory safety vulnerabilities decrease, the overall security risk diminishes, underscoring the effectiveness of prioritizing Safe Coding practices in software development.
