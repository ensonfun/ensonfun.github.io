### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an incident where Cory received a notice claiming to be a second notice, suggesting that he missed the first one. However, the author questions whether this was a deliberate mischaracterization by the sender to establish willful violation or to trick Cory into thinking he missed the first notice. The author speculates about possible ways to send a first notice in a manner that makes it unlikely to be received, such as using a typo in the address or sending an email that may be classified as spam.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author questions whether making a minor mistake in attribution can be considered "wilful infringement." They suggest that as a layperson, they would believe that any reasonable effort to comply with license requirements would indicate unintentional infringement. However, they note that if a large company purposely tries to avoid maximum penalties and intentionally infringes copyright, this should be classified as wilful infringement.

## 4. [Bob_cassette_rewinder](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39623128)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 This article discusses the author's experience with the Bob Dishwasher by Daan Tech and their discovery of a way to defeat the detergent cartridge DRM to refill it at a much lower cost. The Bob Dishwasher is a compact countertop dishwasher that does not require plumbing and uses an all-in-one detergent cartridge called the Bob Cassette. The author likes the convenience of the Bob Cassette but finds the cost of buying them to be expensive. They also question the need for the dishwasher's internet connectivity, which allows for automatic reordering of cassettes. The author explores the internal circuitry of the Bob Cassette and discovers that it contains an I2C EEPROM, which they believe is responsible for storing information about the number of washes left. The author concludes that while using the Bob Cassette is convenient, they prefer to find a more cost-effective solution for refilling the detergent.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes a company's use of cassettes for their detergent, arguing that they are unnecessary and simply a way for the company to generate more profit. The author suggests that the machines can function perfectly fine with normal dish detergent and that the cassettes only contribute to more plastic waste. The company's claim of being eco-friendly is seen as insincere, with the author suggesting alternative solutions such as using smaller amounts of liquid or powder detergent or using wax-lined cardboard containers. Overall, the article accuses the company of greenwashing and selling more unnecessary products.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes the idea of calling a dishwasher "eco-compact" while requiring disposable plastic to function. The author argues that the water saved by the dishwasher does not outweigh the plastic waste it generates. The article also questions the contradiction between the company's claim of working towards a more sustainable world and their promotion of a washing machine that produces a significant amount of plastic waste.

## 6. [Fractional scales, fonts and hinting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39625917)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 GTK 4.14 will be released soon with new renderers that improve support for fractional scaling. The renderers allow for subpixel positioning and hinted rendering, resulting in crisper font rendering with fractional scaling. The new renderers determine whether to use hinting based on the font options, with hinting applied in the vertical direction. The horizontal bars of characters like "T" and "e" remain consistent across lines. GTK 4 does not use subpixel rendering but instead uses grayscale antialiasing for font rendering. GTK is a toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces and is commonly used in the GNOME development platform.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Haiku OS has a unique approach to scaling by basing everything on a default font size in pixels. This allows GUI widgets and text to scale proportionally. Unlike a global scaling factor, each app's developers can decide how to use this information, resulting in different parts of the GUI being scaled disproportionately. While some apps may not adhere to this scaling, developers are promptly notified to fix them. Haiku has implemented this feature since its inception, and by 2024, almost all non-compliant apps have been updated to support it. However, Haiku still needs a font setting per screen/resolution to support multi-monitor setups with varying scaling factors.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a recent development in Gtk4, a software development toolkit. There was a previous issue with crisp text rendering in Gtk4 on non-HiDPI displays, but a recent change has automatically applied the necessary setting, allowing for better text rendering. The article also mentions that Apple avoids this issue by using HiDPI displays.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the comic lettering style of Charles Crumb, the older brother of Robert Crumb, a famous underground comic artist. Charles Crumb had a particular obsession with drawing the story of Treasure Island, focusing on the conversations between Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins. Due to some form of psychosis, the text boxes in his comics became increasingly larger, eventually overshadowing the images themselves. The text became a mere impression of text, suggesting a condition known as Graphomania. The article provides links to examples of Charles Crumb's work and suggests watching a documentary about the three Crumb brothers.

## 9. [Sky lapse in two tone](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39627443)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 The article discusses the capabilities of the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite in capturing images of the changing energy system at sea. Unlike traditional satellite imagery services that primarily focus on land, Sentinel-1's synthetic-aperture radar can detect objects at sea and through clouds, providing a clearer picture of offshore infrastructure and shipping lanes. The ocean economy is growing rapidly, with a significant portion of international trade and the energy transition taking place at sea. The article highlights the growth of offshore wind farms, such as Hornsea 2 off the Yorkshire coast, which can supply electricity to millions of homes. The satellite imagery also reveals offshore oil and gas rigs, which are declining in number, and the busy shipping lanes, particularly around Singapore. The article mentions investigations into the potential laundering of Russian oil into European refineries, as well as the impact of droughts on the Panama Canal and LNG market.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issues surrounding gold recovery. While gold recovery is efficient, it is socially and environmentally toxic. This is due to the destruction of poor economies, the presence of harmful substances like PCBs and Cyanide, and the contamination of waste water and people's bodies. The author suggests that even if an alternative technique is less efficient, it could be valuable if it is less toxic and utilizes another waste stream. They also mention the potential for extracting gallium and other trace elements from chips to address supply chain risks, noting that the lack of viable rare earth mines in the West is due to their reliance on Chinese sources.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the ongoing efforts to extract gold and other precious metals from seawater, which has an abundant but highly diluted supply. The author expresses hope that the content of the article might offer a breakthrough solution to this longstanding challenge.
