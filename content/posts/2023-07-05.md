They explain that progress is slow, taking about a month for each small step forward, and that success is uncertain. However, they note that the game is missing the concept of "leveling up" - as you accomplish more, your chances of future success should increase. They compare this to the process of completing a PhD, where early wins and perseverance lead to building on success. In summary, the author suggests that happy PhD experiences are similar, while unhappy ones differ in their own ways.

## 4. [Simple Unix Chat](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36594916)

**Total comment counts : 39**

### Summary

 This article discusses a text-based chat system called suc that is implemented in just five lines of bash code. The system leverages the features provided by modern UNIX implementations and can achieve the same core functionality as larger chat systems like Slack and Mattermost with only a fraction of the code. The article highlights suc's security agnosticism, which allows it to be lean and potentially more secure. It explains how suc uses SSH for authentication and UNIX's access control API for access control. The article also discusses suc's capabilities for displaying rich text using ANSI escape codes and its integration with other tools and software. Overall, suc offers a lightweight and efficient alternative to more complex chat systems.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 6. [Dark Waters of Self-Delusion: The crash of Transair flight 810](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36590806)

**Total comment counts : 18**

### Summary

 In July 2021, a Transair flight in Hawaii experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff. The pilots attempted to turn back to the airport but soon lost power in their second engine. They successfully ditched the plane in the ocean and were rescued. Two years later, the National Transportation Safety Board released a report revealing that the pilots mishandled the emergency and unnecessarily attempted the ditching. The report also raised concerns about the safety culture at Transair. Prior to the incident, there was a heated argument between the captain and a female first officer in the cockpit. The pilots failed to properly communicate and address the emergency situation, and the confusion led to the mishandling of the engines and a dangerous outcome.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article clarifies that the sexism mentioned in the article is unrelated to the crash being discussed. The author, who identifies as a woman, mentioned it to draw attention to the statements made by a man involved in the incident. The author highlights that the crash could have been influenced by the stress experienced by the captain due to the incident. This hypothesis is supported by evidence but is not presented as an established fact. The author also notes that the NTSB report does not address this potential cause of stress. The author reached out to NTSB investigators for comment, but they declined interviews.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the error of shutting off the good engine after an engine failure, which has resulted in multiple crashes. It explains that determining which engine has failed can be challenging. The article provides links to three previous incidents related to this issue: a fatal E-11 crash in Afghanistan, the Kegworth air disaster, and the BUA BAC11-G-ASJJ incident.

## 8. [Show HN: Iridescent crystal with raymarching and signed distance fields](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36591767)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The article discusses the use of raymarching and signed distance fields (SDFs) in creating 3D scenes. In the demoscene, where small and self-contained computer programs are created, traditional 3D modeling approaches using libraries and meshes are not feasible. Instead, raymarching and SDFs are used to define geometry and render scenes in a single shader program. The article walks through the process of creating an iridescent crystal using raymarching and SDFs, including implementing lighting and materials. The author also mentions resources such as GLSL modules and stackgl/packages for creating various effects and shaers. Overall, raymarching with SDFs offers a unique and visually striking approach to creating 3D scenes.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of signed distance fields (SDFs) for rendering a polyhedron. It argues that a traditional rasterization approach would be more suitable in this case. The polyhedron has 32 vertices and 60 triangles, which means the indexed mesh would require 744 bytes of VRAM. However, using FP16 coordinates, the size can be reduced to 552 bytes. This is less data than the GLSL source code needed for computing and rendering the SDF. Additionally, rasterization with MSAA enabled would provide better visual quality.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article explained complex concepts like Raymarching and SDF in a way that was easy to understand, helping the reader who had previously struggled with these topics.

## 9. [LXD is now under Canonical](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36592343)

**Total comment counts : 17**

### Summary

 The article announces that the LXD project is no longer part of the LinuxContainers project and can now be found on Canonical's websites. Canonical, the creator and main contributor of LXD, has decided to move the project directly under its own set of projects after 8 years with Linux Containers. The Linux Containers team respects this decision and is currently in the process of transferring the project. The article also mentions that some changes can be expected, but the integration process should happen rapidly.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author praises Stéphane Graber's work and the potential of LXD, but states that they were driven away from it due to Canonical's Snap and its auto updates, which they consider to be problematic and capable of causing issues with a cluster.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of LXD software and mentions that the majority of contributions already come from Canonical, indicating that the project's trajectory may not be significantly impacted. The author also expresses a preference for running LXD on NixOS hosts, but hopes that Canonical does not disrupt this setup.

## 10. [Tips for programmers to stay ahead of generative AI](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36586248)

**Total comment counts : 58**

### Summary

 The article discusses how programmers can stay ahead of generative artificial intelligence (AI) that is powered by large language models (LLMs). While AI has the potential to impact the role of programmers, experts argue that human programmers won't be replaced immediately. To remain relevant, programmers should focus on skills such as problem-solving, software engineering practices, and domain expertise. They should also experiment with different AI tools, be clear in their interactions with AI coding assistants, and be critical of the outputs generated by AI models. Learning the basics of AI and understanding its limitations and potential risks is also important. Ultimately, programmers need to embrace AI as a tool and incorporate it into their workflow while relying on their own coding capabilities to thrive.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of programming and suggests that the actual coding is not the most difficult part. The author argues that an AI would be most useful in tasks such as interviewing customers and partners, determining project requirements, creating domain models, identifying message passing needs, deciding on persistence technologies, and making other design decisions. The author emphasizes that a significant portion of programming involves making these decisions and that the actual coding can be straightforward once everything is planned. The author expresses skepticism that future AI advancements will replace or significantly augment human programmers, but suggests that improvements in tools like auto-complete in code editors would be beneficial.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article uses LLM-based autocomplete in their IDE, but believes it will only take away their job if it improves significantly. They find it useful for filling in boilerplate code, but still need to double-check its output for errors. The author agrees with the article's advice to be critical of the autocomplete's suggestions. They estimate that it improves their productivity by around 5%, which they consider to be a significant achievement. They have become reliant on the autocomplete feature and find coding without it to be tedious.
