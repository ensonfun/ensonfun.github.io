## 1. [Why are cancer guidelines stuck in PDFs?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42498462)

**Total comment counts : 43**

### Summary

 The article discusses the complexity of cancer treatment and the role of clinical guidelines in standardizing care. Here's a summary:

- **Standardization of Treatment**: Despite extensive research, treatments for the same cancer type can vary between hospitals due to differences in doctor training, time pressures, and access to latest research. Clinical guidelines aim to standardize care by providing structured recommendations based on the latest evidence.

- **Development of Guidelines**: Organizations like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) in the U.S. bring together experts to create detailed, annually updated guidelines for various cancers. These guidelines consider numerous patient scenarios, suggesting tests, treatments, and follow-ups.

- **Implementation Challenges**: Even with guidelines, application can vary. Doctors must navigate complex flowcharts, manage multiple patient factors, and keep up with guideline updates, which can be cumbersome and lead to oversight or outdated practice.

- **Benefits of Guidelines**: While not eliminating variability, guidelines reduce the scope of judgment calls doctors need to make, potentially improving patient outcomes by ensuring treatments are based on the best available evidence.

- **Institutional Advantages**: Centers like Mayo Clinic and MD Anderson often have better outcomes due to their systematic implementation of these guidelines, alongside other advantages like funding and access to clinical trials.

- **Room for Improvement**: The article suggests that despite the efforts in creating guidelines, their format and accessibility could be improved to better assist doctors in real-time clinical decision-making, reducing the gap between guideline availability and actual patient care.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the complexity of medical knowledge and why it cannot simply be compiled into a single, straightforward JSON file or a similar static data structure. Here are the key points:

1. **Guidelines as Decision Trees**: Medical guidelines serve as decision trees, but they are not meant for simple, rote application. Real-world patients vary greatly, making exact matches to guidelines rare or non-existent.

2. **Human Element in Medicine**: Guidelines are designed for teams of clinicians who are highly trained, accustomed to working together, and capable of recognizing when guidelines need adjustment or expansion. This human element is crucial, as it involves intuition and experience not easily codified into algorithms or static documents.

3. **Challenges in Digitization**: While it would be beneficial to treat medical knowledge like software code, with version control systems (VCS) allowing for modifications or forks by specialists, the human or "wetware" dependencies in medicine are far more complex than digital or "silicon" dependencies. This complexity makes it difficult to discretize medical knowledge in a straightforward, universally applicable manner.

4. **Aspirations vs. Reality**: The desire to simplify medical knowledge into a manageable, modifiable format is admirable but faces significant hurdles due to the nuanced nature of medical practice. Progress in digitizing medical guidelines is more feasible when approached collaboratively by teams who understand the intricacies involved.

In essence, while the idea of a universally accessible and easily modifiable database of medical knowledge is appealing, the article argues that the nature of medicine, with its variability and human judgment, makes this vision currently unattainable. However, incremental progress is possible within the framework of well-coordinated medical teams.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article argues against using a custom tool for medical records in favor of PDFs. The main points are:

1. **Custom Tools**: These are often unique to specific practices or electronic medical record (EMR) systems, making them expensive to develop and maintain.

2. **PDFs**: Despite their drawbacks, PDFs are durable, portable, and universally compatible. They can be used across different practices without needing customization for each.

3. **Critique of the Author's Solution**: The author of the original proposal suggests a custom tool, but the critic believes this solution would be problematic due to its complexity, the likelihood of only the creator understanding it fully, and the numerous potential edge cases that could arise. 

In summary, the article advocates for the use of PDFs over custom tools due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and universal applicability in medical settings.

## 5. [Demystifying Debuggers, Part 2: The Anatomy of a Running Program](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42498982)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of a "program" in the context of multitasking operating systems, contrasting it with simpler systems like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Here are the key points:

1. **Definition of a Program**: A program in modern computing is not just a single entity but a collection of mechanisms designed to mimic the functionality of physical game cartridges in systems like the NES, which only ran one program at a time.

2. **Multitasking OS**: Unlike the NES, modern OSes allow multiple programs to run simultaneously. This requires:
   - **Virtual Address Spaces**: Each program operates in its own virtual memory space, preventing conflicts and unauthorized access to memory used by other programs.
   - **Threads of Execution**: Programs are divided into threads, which are scheduled by the OS to run on the CPU, allowing for multitasking.
   - **Executable Images**: These are the blueprint or the static form of a program, containing machine instructions and necessary metadata.
   - **Loader**: This OS component translates the executable image into a running process by loading it into memory.
   - **Modules**: Parts of a program that can be loaded or unloaded dynamically during runtime.
   - **Process**: A live instance of a program, encompassing modules and threads, each having its own virtual address space.

3. **Virtualization of Resources**: Operating systems use virtualization to ensure that programs run independently and securely, even though they might be competing for the same physical resources like CPU time or memory.

4. **Address Space**: The article explains the misconception of memory being a simple linear space. Instead, each program sees its own virtual address space, which maps to physical memory through OS mediation, ensuring isolation between programs.

5. **Security and Isolation**: Virtual address spaces are crucial for preventing one program from accessing or corrupting the memory of another, thus enhancing system security and stability.

The article aims to clarify how debuggers, which analyze other programs, must understand these underlying concepts to effectively monitor and control program execution in a multitasking environment.

**Total comment counts : 204**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's perspective on coding practices, particularly focusing on the use of IDE features like Language Server Protocol (LSP) tools for navigation within code. Here are the key points:

1. **Coding Without Tools**: The author inquires how developers manage without tools like go-to-definition features in IDEs, which help navigate to function definitions or implementations across files.

2. **Learning from a Blind Programmer**: The author recounts a conversation with an exceptionally organized blind programmer who doesn't rely on visual aids or modern IDE features. This programmer emphasized the importance of organizing code in such a way that its structure is intuitive and easy to navigate mentally.

3. **Philosophy of Code Organization**: Inspired by this interaction, the author began to prioritize logical and clear code organization over reliance on IDE features. This approach ensures that the codebase's structure is understandable and maintainable without technological crutches.

4. **Critique of IDE Features**: The author expresses concern that over-reliance on features like Ctrl+Click for navigation might mask underlying structural problems in the code. These tools can prevent developers from seeing and fixing issues related to poor code organization.

5. **Shift in Perspective**: The conversation with the blind programmer and subsequent encounters with other visually impaired coders who similarly excelled in code organization changed the author's approach to coding. Instead of focusing on specific methodologies like Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the author now aims to make code placement and structure feel "natural" and intuitive.

6. **Advocacy Against Overuse of Tools**: The author argues against the heavy use of LSP features, suggesting that while they aid navigation, they might hinder developers from addressing and improving the codebase's structural integrity.

In summary, the article advocates for a coding philosophy where the structure of code is paramount, suggesting that good organization should make navigation tools less necessary, thereby improving the overall quality and maintainability of software.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's perspective on code organization, inspired by their encounter with a blind programmer who emphasized the importance of logical and intuitive code structure. The blind programmer's ability to write highly organized code without visual aids highlighted the necessity of a clear mental model for code navigation. This experience led the author to value straightforward, logical project structures over reliance on specific programming methodologies or tools like Language Server Protocol (LSP) features in IDEs. The author argues that over-dependence on such tools can hide structural problems in codebases, suggesting that if code isn't intuitively navigable, it indicates a need for refactoring rather than using navigation shortcuts like Ctrl+Click. This philosophy extends to the author's general approach to programming, advocating for a focus on code organization that is accessible and logical, even to those without visual aids.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses two types of programmers who are averse to using Language Server Protocols (LSPs) or Large Language Models (LLMs):

1. **The HLSP (Human LSP) User**: These programmers do not use LSPs directly but instead rely on a human partner to assist with coding tasks like navigating code, checking method names, and identifying syntax errors. They are effective with a human "conduit" but their efficiency drops significantly when working alone.

2. **I am one with the machine**: This group consists of experienced programmers who have been coding since before modern IDEs and LSPs were common. They've developed their own sophisticated set of tools and methods for coding tasks, often involving custom scripts or plugins like Elisp or Vim plugins. They are highly proficient with these self-developed systems, which might look complex or arcane to outsiders. They might use LSPs but often with many features disabled because they find their own methods more efficient or comfortable.

The article highlights that while Group 2 might not benefit significantly from switching to LSPs due to their established proficiency, Group 1 could potentially improve their productivity by adopting these tools, though they currently resist or see no need for change. Both groups showcase different approaches to coding efficiency, with neither being inherently superior, but rather tailored to their comfort and historical practice.
