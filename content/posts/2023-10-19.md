LocalSend allows users to securely share files and messages with nearby devices over a local network without an internet connection. Unlike other messaging apps, LocalSend does not rely on external servers, making it a fast and reliable solution for local communication. The app uses a secure communication protocol with a REST API and HTTPS encryption for maximum security. Users can contribute to the app by translating it to other languages or opening a pull request for improvements.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the implementation of a communication protocol called LocalSend, which claims to ensure maximum security by using a REST API and sending data securely over HTTPS. The TLS/SSL certificate is generated on each device to enhance security. However, the article questions how maximum security can be achieved while generating X.509 certificates on the device. The article also mentions that a HTTP non-encrypted mode exists, and the fingerprint of the certificate is used to avoid discovery collisions. It suggests that sharing fingerprints through out-of-band methods, such as visual comparison or QR code scanning, could help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. However, the article notes that the documentation does not provide clear information about this aspect. Overall, the article raises concerns about the implementation and discovery protocols of LocalSend.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the risks of using an asset deal to eliminate employees and their benefits in Germany. The labor courts in the country have specific criteria to determine if the new company is essentially a continuation of the old one. If certain conditions are met, such as employees performing the same tasks, using the same office space, and having similar salaries or contracts, the transaction could be considered a "hidden transfer of business." In such cases, all employees and their benefits would automatically transfer to the new company, making it difficult to dismiss anyone. The article suggests that only poorly informed managers would attempt to use this tactic in Germany.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article states that it is illegal to discriminate against employees because of their union activities or sympathies. Although enforcement may be weak, the act of discrimination is still against the law.

## 5. [Early Europeans ate seaweed for thousands of years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37943843)

**Total comment counts : 40**

### Summary

 A new study has found evidence that early Europeans consumed seaweed and other aquatic plants. Researchers analyzed fossilized dental plaque from the remains of 74 early humans and detected chemical biomarkers of seaweed and aquatic plants in 26 samples. The findings suggest that early humans were eating or chewing these plants as early as the Mesolithic period and continued to do so into the Neolithic period and early Middle Ages. The presence of these biomarkers challenges the assumption that the introduction of farming during the Neolithic era led to the abandonment of aquatic plants as food. The researchers also found evidence of aquatic plants in teeth from a site located far from the coast. However, it remains unclear how the plants were prepared and the extent to which they were consumed. The study hopes to encourage people to incorporate seaweed and aquatic plants into their modern diets due to their nutritional benefits and environmental sustainability.

## 8. [Google-hosted malvertising leads to fake Keepass site that looks genuine](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37938866)

**Total comment counts : 35**

### Summary

 Google has been hosting a malicious ad that mimics the open source password manager Keepass, potentially deceiving security-savvy users. The ad redirects to a URL that appears to be the genuine Keepass site, but upon closer inspection, it is encoded to display a different URL associated with the FakeBat malware. The ads have been running since Saturday, paid for by a verified advertiser called Digital Eagle. The encoding scheme used, called punycode, makes it difficult to detect fraudulent Google ads or encoded URLs. It is recommended to manually type URLs or inspect the TLS certificate to ensure legitimacy.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article mentions that the ads were paid for by Digital Eagle, an advertiser whose identity has been verified by Google. The author criticizes Google's verification process, suggesting that it is based on accepting money. They also express frustration with Google's lack of response to emails and the effectiveness of reporting phishing and spam. The author concludes by stating that it is time to move on from Google, as they believe it is no longer safe to use as a search engine. Additionally, the author shares a list of domains they have blocked due to clients being sent to phishing sites through Google's ads.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests that advertising intermediaries should be held partly responsible for fraudulent advertisements or that advertising should be made less anonymous. The author is not a fan of German-style "impressum" requirements for general publishing, but believes that advertising is different because it aggressively inserts itself onto other sites without the user's control. The author proposes that it should be possible to click on an advertisement and easily find the company's number and business address. The author also thinks that overseas advertisements originating from different countries should be heavily checked, as it is more difficult to take action against fraudulent ads even if they are not anonymous.
