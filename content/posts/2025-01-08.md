## 2. [Cracking a 512-bit DKIM key for less than $8 in the cloud](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42633501)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The article discusses a study on the security of email authentication protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) among the top 1 million websites, focusing particularly on DKIM keys. Here are the key points:

1. **Discovery of Short Keys**: Over 1,700 DKIM keys were found to be less than 1,024 bits, which are considered insecure and have been deprecated since 2018 by RFC 8301.

2. **Cracking a Key**: The researchers chose to crack a 512-bit RSA public key from redfin.com to demonstrate the vulnerability. They used Python to decode the key and then applied the Number Field Sieve (NFS) algorithm via the CADO-NFS tool to factorize the modulus into its prime factors, which took about 86 hours on a rented cloud server.

3. **Testing the Compromised Key**: After obtaining the private key, they set up a DKIM signature test, sending emails purporting to be from redfin.com. While most email providers rejected emails signed with this insecure key, three major services (Yahoo Mail, Mailfence, and Tuta) passed the DKIM check, allowing the emails to pass DMARC verification.

4. **Security Implications**: The experiment showed that even with current technology, breaking a 512-bit RSA key is feasible with minimal resources, highlighting the need for email providers to reject signatures from keys shorter than 1,024 bits.

5. **Recommendations**: The researchers urged domain owners to update their DKIM records to use keys of at least 1,024 bits and alerted email providers to reject short-key DKIM signatures. They also provided a simple method to check key length by counting characters in the Base64 encoded DKIM record.

6. **Conclusion**: The study underscores the ease with which outdated and insecure cryptographic practices can be exploited, advocating for stronger security measures in email authentication to prevent such vulnerabilities.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article from 14 years ago, linked in the provided text, discusses how it was feasible back then to factorize 512-bit RSA keys, specifically referencing the DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) RSA key used by Facebook at the time. The author of the blog post highlighted that even with the technology available in 2010, such keys could be broken, indicating concerns over the security of using relatively short key lengths for cryptographic purposes.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an interesting scenario involving DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) key sizes:

- The author suggests trying to use a 4096-bit DKIM key as an experiment. 
- While setting up this key in DNS will pass all online checks for DKIM and SPF (Sender Policy Framework), any email sent using this key will fail validation tests.
- The reason for this failure is that although it's valid to use keys larger than 2048 bits in DKIM, there is no requirement for email systems to process keys larger than this size.
- The author learned this the hard way, implying they experienced difficulties or unexpected outcomes when implementing this in practice.

## 9. [How to Debounce a Contact (2014)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42601890)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article discusses the problem of switch bounce in electronic devices, detailing how mechanical switches can cause multiple signals to be sent when only one is intended due to the physical nature of their contacts. Here's a summary:

- **Purpose**: The author conducted experiments to understand and document the characteristics of switch bounce to improve debounce coding techniques.

- **Methodology**: Various types of switches were tested using an Agilent MSO-X 3054A mixed-signal oscilloscope (MSO) which allowed observation of both analog and digital signals. This setup was chosen after initial plans to use a microcontroller (MSP430) proved inadequate for capturing very short bounce times.

- **Findings**: 
  - Switches showed varied and sometimes unexpected bouncing behavior, with bounces as short as under 100 nanoseconds. 
  - These brief transitions, while not always captured by microcontrollers, can still cause issues when tied to interrupts in software debounce routines.

- **Implications**: 
  - The article emphasizes the need for understanding the full scope of switch bounce to develop effective debounce solutions, either in hardware or software. 
  - It criticizes the common practice of relying on anecdotal evidence and calls for more empirical research into switch behavior.

- **Additional Notes**: 
  - The article is divided into revisions, with updates added over the years, showing an evolution in the research and findings.
  - There's mention of external resources, like Trent Cleghorn's code, added in a later revision.
  - The author also touches on the practical implications of poor debouncing, using examples like TV remote controls and FM radio tuning.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of dealing with electromagnetic interference (EMI) in industrial settings:

1. **Steel Mill Experience**: The author describes installing a system with Z80 processors and a PDP-11 computer in a steel mill where a massive motor, which reversed direction frequently, caused significant electrical noise. This noise was so disruptive that it required extensive signal conditioning and protection like optocoupling to prevent damage to electronic components.

2. **Elevator Motor Issue**: In another instance, an elevator motor's operation caused "phantom keypresses" on a terminal's capacitive keypad, even activating debug buttons that weren't physically present on the production model. This led to unexpected behavior in the system.

3. **Solutions Implemented**: The solutions involved:
   - Excluding debug code from production firmware to avoid unintended access to debug modes.
   - Enhancing transient suppression hardware and debouncing firmware to manage and mitigate the effects of EMI.

These anecdotes highlight the importance of designing electronic systems with robust EMI protection in environments with high electrical noise.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with debouncing switches for hobbyist electronic projects, particularly for CNC endstop switches and simple button interfaces for counters. After trying various suggested methods for debouncing that failed, the author found a successful solution:

1. **Switch Configuration**: The switch is set to be pulled either high or low.
2. **Capacitor Use**: A capacitor connected to ground helps in smoothing out the switch's signal.
3. **Schmitt Trigger**: The switch signal is then passed through a Schmitt trigger to clean up the signal, ensuring a clean transition between states.

The author implemented this solution on a custom PCB, which resolved all issues with signal integrity, resulting in perfect square wave outputs. This was confirmed by adding test points on the PCB for waveform analysis. The process highlighted how many ineffective suggestions the author had to bypass before arriving at this effective, simple hardware debounce technique.
