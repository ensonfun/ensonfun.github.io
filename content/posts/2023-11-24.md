Ansel is available in English, French, and simplified Chinese, with partial translations in other languages.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the work of a former developer of "darktable," a photo editing software. The developer forked the codebase to create their own version with different ideas about how things should be done. Some UI improvements have been made in the new version. Currently, both "Ansel" and "darktable" are compatible in terms of the underlying database, allowing users to switch between them easily. However, if the fork diverges significantly, maintaining compatibility could become more challenging. In recent years, "darktable" has undergone significant changes, transitioning from a "display-referred" to a "scene-referred" workflow. The developer played a key role in implementing this change, notably with the addition of the Filmic module. While "darktable" may not be as user-friendly or polished as commercial tools like Lightroom, Affinity, or Capture One, it is capable if users invest time in learning it.

## 3. [Mirage â€“ A programming framework for building type-safe, modular systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38391446)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 MirageOS is a library operating system that creates unikernels for secure and high-performance network applications on various cloud computing and mobile platforms. It allows code to be developed on a regular operating system like Linux or macOS, and then compiled into a standalone unikernel that runs under a hypervisor. This enables services to run more efficiently, securely, and with finer control compared to traditional software stacks. MirageOS applications have faster start-up times, smaller binary sizes, and use less memory than traditional applications. They are written in the OCaml programming language and use libraries for networking, storage, and concurrency. MirageOS 4.0 was released in March 2022, with previous versions released in 2017, 2014, and 2013. The framework is self-hosted, and documentation and resources are available for getting started.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the idea of compiling applications with a thin layer of support libraries instead of a full operating system (OS). This approach allows the application to run in a virtualized environment, eliminating the need for SSH access to the system. By cutting out unnecessary layers in the application's virtual machine, it becomes smaller, starts quickly, and has a reduced attack surface. The article also mentions FreeBSD on Firecracker, which is a full OS that boots in just 25 milliseconds on the Firecracker hypervisor.

## 4. [Mid-old cells are a potential target for anti-aging interventions in the elderly](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38400901)

**Total comment counts : 9**

### Summary

 The article discusses a study that identified a subset of cells, called "mid-old cells," which are neither proliferative nor senescent in elderly tissues. These mid-old cells show upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and downregulation of anti-inflammatory genes. The study also found that the microenvironmental change and functional decline of mid-old cells could be reversed by a protein called SLIT2, which originates from young cells. The accumulation of senescent cells in tissues is known to contribute to aging, but this study suggests that mid-old cells may also play a role in age-related tissue dysfunction. The researchers propose mid-old cells as a potential target for anti-aging therapy.

## 6. [AI system self-organises to develop features of brains of complex organisms](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38401544)

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 Cambridge scientists have conducted a study showing that placing physical constraints on an artificial intelligence (AI) system allows it to develop similar features to the brains of complex organisms. The researchers created a simplified version of the brain using computational nodes and applied a physical constraint. The further apart two nodes were, the more difficult it was for them to communicate, similar to how neurons are organized in the human brain. The AI system was then given a maze navigation task and gradually learned to improve its performance through feedback. The physical constraint led the system to develop hubs, highly connected nodes that facilitate information flow, similar to real human brains. Overall, this research highlights the importance of considering physical constraints in developing AI systems and suggests that the brain's ability to solve complex problems with minimal energy consumption can inspire more efficient AI designs.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a study where researchers added a property to a neural network to simulate a physical constraint of distance. They found that under these conditions, "hubs" emerged that facilitated connections across distance. Additionally, they observed that a single node could encode multiple locations of a maze, instead of needing specialized nodes for each location. The study suggests that neural network architecture should better emulate the operation of the brain in terms of these findings.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author finds it odd that modern neural networks (NNs) are typically two-dimensional and one-directional, while our brains are three-dimensional and have neural feedback loops. The author believes that these feedback loops are crucial for "thought." They wonder why more NN architectures don't have neural loops and propose possible reasons, such as the high training costs or lack of control.

## 10. [The Failed Commodification of Technical Work](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38402515)

**Total comment counts : 43**

### Summary

 The article discusses the author's experience with their data engineer manager who has a passion for cooking. The manager's love for cooking is evident in his excitement over analyzing the heat distribution of chicken in his oven and his extensive collection of cooking books. The manager even expresses admiration for the complexity of running McDonald's. The author mentions reading "The Phoenix Project," a book about IT management, and compares it to corporate fanfiction. The book highlights how IT work is similar to manufacturing plant work. The author also mentions other books that convey similar ideas.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article suggests that a significant portion of what used to be considered technical work has now become commodified. Tasks like mail merging and double-entry bookkeeping, which used to require manual effort or highly trained individuals, can now be easily automated or done by anyone with basic technology skills. While there may not yet be a user-friendly interface for more complex tasks, the main challenge lies in gathering requirements rather than the technical implementation. The author argues that many aspects of IT work have become commodified and no longer require specialized expertise.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article disagrees with the idea of fully commodifying technical work but argues that "The Phoenix Project" does not advocate for it either. The main takeaways from the book are to have clear systems in place, automate repeatable work, minimize work in progress, share information, have multiple team members capable of carrying out tasks, ensure that the work aligns with business needs, and reduce noise and unplanned work. The point is not to turn people into interchangeable automatons but to create a system that allows them to focus on valuable work that cannot be automated. Additionally, while making developers into factory workers is not sensible, work that resembles factory work should be treated in a similar way.
