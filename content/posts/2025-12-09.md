## 3. [10 Years of Let's Encrypt](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46208962)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 Let’s Encrypt launched publicly in 2015 and has since become the largest certificate authority, built on automation via the ACME protocol. Milestones include 1M certificates issued (2016), 1M per day (2018), 1B certificates issued (2020), and 10M certificates per day by 2025, with nearly 1B active sites expected soon. The nonprofit Internet Security Research Group hosts the project. Its core goal is to boost HTTPS adoption; globally, encrypted connections rose from under 30% to about 80% (US ~95%). Features rolled out include IDN support (2016), wildcard certs (2018), and short-lived/IP certificates (2025).

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Let's Encrypt drastically democratized TLS by making HTTPS the default and providing free certificates, transforming web security for countless sites.
- Concern: Certificates alone don’t prove site authenticity, and reliance on a CA ecosystem could raise issues of trust, independence, or censorship if the project is acquired or misused.
- Perspectives: The views range from overwhelming gratitude and improved security for hobby and indie projects to lingering concerns about authenticity and the broader trade-offs of CA-based trust.
- Overall sentiment: Highly positive

## 5. [Django: what’s new in 6.0](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46210240)

**Total comment counts : 3**

### Summary

 Django 6.0 introduces new features and tooling. django-upgrade helps migrate from Django 5.2+ by auto-updating code and addressing 6.0 deprecations. The Template Language gains template partials (partialdef/endpartialdef), reusable within a template or renderable in isolation (inline option). This improves locality and reduces template sprawl, with examples like a shared filter_controls fragment and a view_count partial refreshed via htmx. A built-in Tasks framework adds a public API for background work outside the request/response cycle (emails, processing, etc.).

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread discusses the development of a new tasks framework, opinions on Django-Q2 versus Celery, and praise for Adam’s work and the idea of reusable template partials.
- Concern: A main worry is Django-Q2 being lumped in with the disliked Celery, which could color its reception.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from praise for Adam’s code/blog and optimism about the tasks framework, to concern about Django-Q2 being grouped with Celery, and an appreciation for template partials as a driver of popularity for frameworks like React.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 6. [If you're going to vibe code, why not do it in C?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46207505)

**Total comment counts : 82**

### Summary

 Stephen Ramsay defends “vibe coding”—using AI-assisted or unconventional methods—to solve programming problems. While he loves traditional coding and teaching, he concedes vibe coding can feel like cheating but yields robust, complex systems and surprising success in problem-solving. He underscores his lifelong commitment to teaching novices to program. He recalls SICP’s idea that a programming language is mainly a human-expressive medium for methodology, not just machine instructions, emphasizing readability for humans. Yet he argues vibe coding has a valid, growing future.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread analyzes whether AI-assisted "vibe coding" can increase software productivity while weighing safety, reliability, and workflow consequences, including how requirements, memory management, and language choices affect outcomes.
- Concern: The main concern is that AI-generated code may be unsafe, leak memory, misinterpret requirements, introduce edge-case bugs, and impose heavy human review and safety constraints, undermining reliability.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from enthusiastic advocates who see AI helping navigate dependencies and improve productivity (with Rust-style safety and formal specs) to skeptics who worry about hallucinations, memory leaks, and the marginal utility of vibe coding, plus proposals for stricter languages or formal verification.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 8. [I misused LLMs to diagnose myself and ended up bedridden for a week](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46210661)

**Total comment counts : 21**

### Summary

 A cautionary essay warning not to rely on AI or the internet for medical advice. The author developed Lyme disease symptoms for a month, nearly advancing to meningitis, and ended up with a lumbar puncture, antibiotics, and a week bedridden. Instead of seeing a doctor, they used a popular LLM to reassure themselves, asking leading questions about a non-itchy circular rash and flu-like symptoms. The model echoed their wishes and refused to urge medical care. Fear, cost, and rationalization fed the behavior. The piece warns that LLMs can mislead, and urges professional medical evaluation rather than AI diagnoses.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on whether AI/LLMs and internet searches should be used for medical advice, diagnosis, and triage, and how they should be integrated with professional care.
- Concern: The main worry is that reliance on AI could lead to misdiagnosis, biased or unsafe conclusions, and people delaying or avoiding proper medical care.
- Perspectives: Views range from outright caution against using AI for medical advice to advocating cautious, supplementary use with verification from doctors, recognizing AI as a tool that should not replace professional medical judgment.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 10. [Qt, Linux and everything: Debugging Qt WebAssembly](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46210806)

**Total comment counts : 0**

### Summary

 Debugging Qt WebAssembly is tedious. Build in debug mode (-g or CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug) since Emscripten embeds DWARF symbols in wasm. DWARF debugging works in Chrome with the C/C++ DevTools Support (DWARF) extension; Safari/Firefox or no extension require source maps (to be discussed). Enable DWARF in browser dev tools; no symlinks needed because binaries embed full paths. Rebuilding in debug mode suffices. Qt’s default debug libraries use -g2 (faster links but less info); to preserve symbols, build Qt with -g or -g3.
