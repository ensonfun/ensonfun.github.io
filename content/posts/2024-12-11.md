### Summary

 The 2019 Google paper claiming "quantum supremacy" with their Sycamore processor has been criticized on several grounds:

1. **Estimation of Classical Computing Time**: Google's claim that their quantum computer performed a calculation in 200 seconds, which would take a classical supercomputer 10,000 years, was challenged. Critics argue that Google underestimated the classical computation time by 10 orders of magnitude and was aware of better classical algorithms which they did not consider.

2. **Fidelity and Calibration Issues**:
   - The agreement between predicted and actual fidelity of the quantum circuits was deemed statistically implausible, suggesting methodological flaws in the calibration process.
   - Google's calibration process was criticized for potentially involving a flawed global optimization, as indicated by discrepancies in calibration data provided to other researchers and the lack of transparency regarding the calibration programs.

3. **Transparency and Data Sharing**: Google has not released full error rates for individual components, and there have been inconsistencies in the calibration data provided to external scientists. The team has also not shared the calibration inputs, despite promises to do so in future experiments.

4. **Comparative Performance**: There is a noted performance gap between Google's claimed capabilities and what IBM's quantum computers have achieved, suggesting potential methodological issues rather than superior technology.

5. **Follow-up Experiments**: Suggestions made to Google for improving their experiments were not implemented, and subsequent experiments were even less verifiable than the 2019 experiment.

In summary, the critique suggests that Google's claims of quantum supremacy might be overstated due to significant methodological issues, lack of transparency, and potentially biased experimental design, urging caution in accepting these claims as a basis for policy-making or further scientific advancement.

**Total comment counts : 12**

### Summary

 The article discusses the issue of undefined behavior (UB) in C programming, particularly focusing on how UB can affect both compiler optimizations and the introduction of bugs leading to security vulnerabilities. Here are the key points:

1. **Undefined Behavior in C**: UB in C can be leveraged for performance optimizations but often leads to problematic bugs.

2. **N3322 Proposal**: A proposal named N3322 has been accepted for the next version of the C standard (C2y), which aims to eliminate UB in scenarios involving null pointers combined with zero-length operations. This change will make operations like `memcmp(NULL, NULL, 0)` defined, which were previously undefined.

3. **Implications for Programming**:
   - The change simplifies programming by making certain operations well-defined, reducing unexpected behavior.
   - It does not negatively impact performance and might even allow for better optimizations.

4. **Examples and Issues**: 
   - The article provides examples where UB could occur, like in string comparison functions when both strings are empty, leading to potential optimizations or incorrect behavior by compilers.
   - It discusses how static analyzers will need to adapt, as they can no longer flag all uses of NULL in memory operations as problematic without considering the length.

5. **Standardization and Implementation**:
   - There was some opposition to the proposal, particularly regarding the definition of NULL arithmetic operations, due to concerns over compatibility with address space extensions.
   - Despite initial opposition, the proposal was approved with a recommendation for retroactive application to older standards, meaning compilers and libraries might implement these changes without needing a specific flag.

6. **LLVM Involvement**: The author, involved with LLVM's middle-end, got involved due to the intrinsic memcpy function's specification in LLVM, which can be affected by these changes in the C standard.

The article concludes that removing this particular UB from C will benefit the programming community by making code more predictable and secure, without sacrificing performance.
