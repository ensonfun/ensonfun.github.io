## 1. [If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38579899)

**Total comment counts : 64**

### Summary

 The article discusses the issue of DRM (Digital Rights Management) and its impact on consumers. The author recalls a past public spat with Chris Anderson, the former editor in chief of Wired, over the magazine's positive reviews of DRM-encumbered digital devices. The author argued that these devices could have their features revoked without warning or recourse, and proposed that endorsements for such products should come with a disclaimer. The article goes on to highlight the temptation for corporations to change features, prices, and availability of products that consumers have already paid for. The author mentions examples such as inkjet printers rejecting third-party ink and anti-repair features in products that sabotage unauthorized repairs. The article also addresses the legal barriers faced by researchers who attempt to reverse-engineer DRM-encumbered products. The author concludes that selling a product that can be remotely downgraded without consent invites abuse and that there should be penalties for such actions.

## 6. [QuIP#: 2-bit Quantization for LLMs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38576351)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article discusses the challenges of using large language models (LLMs) due to their size and memory requirements. The researchers propose a compression method called QuIP# that combines lattice codebooks with incoherence processing to create state-of-the-art 2-bit quantized models. Incoherence processing involves transforming weight and Hessian matrices to reduce quantization errors. The researchers use a new lattice codebook based on the E_8 lattice, which achieves optimal packing density and is hardware-friendly. They also employ the RHT (random Hadamard transform) for fast GPU implementation. The QuIP# method significantly closes the gap between 2-bit quantized LLMs and unquantized 16-bit models by improving the quantization performance.

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has ordered Inhance Technologies to stop using a fluorination process that creates per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) impurities in plastic containers. The agency claims that nine PFAS are produced by the process, three of which are highly toxic. Inhance says it has modified the process to reduce PFAS impurities by over 90%. The EPA warned Inhance in 2022 for not complying with a rule requiring notification before producing certain PFAS. The fluorinated HDPE containers treated by Inhance are used for storing personal care products, detergents, and pesticides. The EPA's decision has been welcomed by environmental groups.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a company called Inhance and its response to the EPA's rule regarding fluorination processes. Inhance claims that the rule does not apply to them because they have been using their fluorination process since 1983, before the EPA proposed the rule in 2015. They argue that existing uses are exempt from the rule and state that they will take legal action to protect their customers, suppliers, employees, and the continued use of their technology. The summarizer adds a sarcastic comment on Inhance's argument, highlighting their reasoning that they should be allowed to continue poisoning people without consequences.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discovered PFAS impurities produced by Inhance's fluorination process. This came to their attention after PFAS-contaminated mosquitocide contaminated a drinking water supply in Massachusetts. The EPA determined that the PFAS came from containers treated by Inhance.
