### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the benefits of using QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) as a means to bypass the Great Firewall of China (GFW). By tunneling traffic over QUIC instead of TLS, users experience lower latency and higher throughput, especially if they modify the congestion control. Additionally, even for foreign websites that are not blocked by the GFW, QUIC offers noticeable improvements in latency compared to TCP-based protocols, due to the high round-trip time (RTT) between China and the rest of the world.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author is reflecting on their lack of understanding of basic concepts related to web servers and the handling of connections. They question whether it is the kernel's responsibility to assemble packets of data into streams that the server can process. They also acknowledge a misconception about web servers having their own port, when in reality only the client side is randomly assigned a port. The author wonders how a server without threading handles multiple incoming streams and if the kernel buffers data from multiple clients while waiting for the server to process it. They admit to not knowing where to start in order to better understand these concepts. Additionally, they express confusion about how incoming data on a single server socket is processed by individual threads for specific clients, particularly in the context of something called HTTP smuggling. They question how multiple TCP connections on a single server port are transformed into individual HTTP requests and raise the issue of threaded processing in the context of HTTP smuggling. Overall, the author seeks a deeper understanding of these mechanisms.

## 3. [Where does my computer get the time from?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37778496)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 The article discusses where computers get their time from. It explains that the time is obtained from Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers, which are connected in layers. Stratum 3 servers get the time from stratum 2 servers, which in turn get the time from stratum 1 servers. These stratum 1 servers get the time from reference clocks, such as GPS receivers or radio signals. The GPS receivers, in turn, get the time from Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado. The base gets its time from the US Naval Observatory Alternate Master Clock in Washington DC, which has atomic clocks and receives time information from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris. The article also discusses the history of time measurement and the standardization of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the NIST Randomness Beacon, which is a prototype implementation that generates random bit-strings. These bit-strings are posted in blocks of 512 bits every 60 seconds. Each value is sequence-numbered, time-stamped, and signed, and includes the hash of the previous value. This chaining of values helps prevent tampering with the output package. The article mentions that NIST is already putting time on the blockchain, which was previously joked about.
