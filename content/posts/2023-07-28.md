## 1. [Cap'n Proto 1.0](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36908309)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The author announces the release of version 1.0 of Cap'n Proto's C++ reference implementation. They admit that not much has changed since the previous version, but highlight some optimizations made to improve performance of Cap'n Proto RPC. They also mention a breaking change where servers now use an annotation on the schema to opt into allowing RPC cancellation. The author explains that the motivation for releasing version 1.0 is to start working on version 2.0, which will include changes to the C++ API and the KJ C++ toolkit library. They discuss the advantages of using KJ and mention ideas for the upcoming version 2.0, such as requiring a compiler with support for C++20, revising the RPC and HTTP APIs to be more coroutine-friendly, and dropping support for exceptions disabled and other exotic modes. They assure that there are no plans to make any backwards-incompatible changes to the serialization format or RPC protocol. However, a formal release of version 2.0 is not expected for a few years.

## 2. [Faster filesystem access with Directfs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36901543)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The article discusses the implementation of Directfs as the default feature in runsc, which is a component of gVisor used by Google internally. Directfs allows gVisor's application kernel to have secure direct access to the container filesystem, eliminating the need for round trips to the filesystem gofer. The gofer was originally implemented to provide secure access to remote filesystems, but it added unnecessary overhead. Directfs uses Linux's filesystem isolation mechanisms to securely expose the container filesystem to the sandbox. By avoiding gofer round trips, Directfs significantly improves performance, resulting in a reduction in the absolute time to run workloads. This implementation demonstrates ongoing efforts to enhance gVisor's performance.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article humorously discusses the concept of accessing local file systems from containers. It challenges the idea that containers should be stateless and discusses the possibility of using remote block devices for better performance and security. The author dreams of a system where containers can transparently mount network resources from any node.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a technology called DirectFS, which is a way to access the host's local file system. It replaces a part of the operating system file system API, allowing containers to directly talk to the file system once they obtain a file descriptor. DirectFS is useful for running untrusted containers on trusted hosts and may be targeted at services like Fargate, where multiple customers run on a single host. The author speculates that this may be due to the availability of energy-efficient ARM servers. They suggest that implementing the security measure to enable untrusted container access to the host's file system should be done in the container runtime or even in the host's operating system.

## 5. [How to check if two SQL tables are the same](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36889656)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 The article discusses how to check if the contents of two SQL tables are the same. The author explores different methods, such as using the EXCEPT operator and grouping the tables, but finds limitations with these approaches. They then propose a solution that involves viewing tables as vectors and using mathematical concepts like moments and permutations to compare them. The article concludes by providing a query that can be used to compare two tables using only standard SQL features. The author acknowledges that the query is impractical for large tables but highlights the need for a standard feature in SQL to compare tables.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author of the article discusses different methods for comparing tables in SQL. They mention that "sqldiff" is sensitive to ordering and requires sorting with ORDER BY to get accurate results. The use of CHECKSUM is also mentioned, but it is noted that it can be sensitive to ordering as well as potentially producing hash collisions. The author suggests that tables are not considered the same if they only differ by schema and proposes that comparing the results of SQL queries using the tables can be a better way to determine if they are the same. The author admits that there are better ways to compare tables and mentions their own recursive query, but acknowledges that it may not be the most efficient method.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the practical use of SQLite's "sqldiff" utility.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a restriction imposed by the California Department of Education (CDE) that researchers must sign before accessing nonpublic K-12 data. This clause, interpreted broadly by the CDE, prevents researchers from participating in any litigation against the department, even if it is unrelated to their research. The author believes this restriction is unreasonable and expects the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to win in challenging it.

**Total comment counts : 8**

### Summary

 The article discusses the fatal accident that occurred in 1946 involving nuclear physicist Louis Slotin at Los Alamos National Laboratories. Slotin's death was caused by a slip with a screwdriver while demonstrating a potentially dangerous apparatus called the "critical assembly". The article includes illustrations by artist and writer Ben Platts-Mills, who used reconstructions, archive photographs, and his own mock-up of the apparatus to depict the accident. Platts-Mills explains his process of composing the illustrations and striking a balance between scientific accuracy and accessibility.

 I'm sorry, but I am unable to access or summarize specific URLs. However, if you provide some of the main points or content from the article, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses an incident involving an experiment that repeated multiple times to uncover certain parameters and learn particular information. The experiment involved individuals handling a plutonium core, and in one case, a person using a screwdriver to place a beryllium cap on the core. The author questions the purpose of the experiment, the reason for its repetition, and how it progressed to the point where someone was handling the core directly. They also mention a previous experiment with beryllium bricks enclosing the core that resulted in a fatality when it became critical, leading to skepticism about the need to prove that the core could go critical.

## 10. [LeMUR: LLMs for Audio and Speech](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36900294)

**Total comment counts : 13**

### Summary

 The article introduces LeMUR, an API that allows developers to build language model-based (LLM) apps on spoken data. LeMUR offers features such as search, summarization, question-answering, and text generation, with a focus on audio data. It combines various components of an AI stack, including transcription, compression strategies, retrieval techniques, language models, and structured outputs, into a single API. LeMUR is now available for everyone to use, with improvements in accuracy and higher input/output limits. Users can build apps that understand key points, extract action items, answer questions, and generate catchy titles and short-form content. The API enables flexible summarization, question-answering, and action item generation, with the ability to add specific context and prompts. LeMUR can be tried out through Playground or accessed directly through the API. While currently focused on English, LeMUR has shown promise in generating responses in other common languages. Developers can refer to the LeMUR Best Practices guide for guidance on endpoints, prompts, and generating desired outputs. The API supports the analysis of large amounts of audio data in a single call.
