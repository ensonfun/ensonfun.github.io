### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the benefits of using entity-component architectures in line-of-business applications. The author suggests that developers who are used to a CRUD model struggle to think in terms of columns rather than rows. However, once they understand how polymorphic this approach can be, they may find it useful for various types of data. The article also mentions that this approach is not necessarily incompatible with object-oriented programming and cites an example of using Active Record for persistence in Ruby.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights the importance of considering multiple interpretations and perspectives when defining a data layout. It suggests that if there is only one valid view of the data, it may make sense to encode it in code. However, if there is any uncertainty, a relational-style model, such as SQL, is usually more effective. The author is curious about the reasons behind the trend of moving away from one large SQL database, even though most businesses do not face scalability challenges.

## 5. [Goodreads was the future of book reviews, then Amazon bought it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575003)

**Total comment counts : 55**

### Summary

 Goodreads, the book review website owned by Amazon, is facing criticism for its outdated technology and lack of moderation, allowing users to engage in targeted harassment known as "review bombing." Former employees claim that Amazon has neglected the site, only using it for its user-generated data. Recent incidents, such as author Elizabeth Gilbert canceling the release of her novel due to one-star ratings based on political reasons, have highlighted the issue. Goodreads allows any user to leave ratings before books are released, leading to abuse and little recourse for authors. Despite its potential and initial excitement, Goodreads has failed to live up to expectations since Amazon acquired it in 2013. Critics argue that Goodreads needs better moderation tools to prevent harassment and maintain credibility.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article argues that while Goodreads was a good review site, it did not live up to being "the future of book reviews." The author believes that Amazon should never have been allowed to acquire Goodreads because it was highly anti-competitive. The article suggests that Amazon had no intention of utilizing Goodreads and that the acquisition was merely a defensive move to prevent other companies from partnering with or acquiring Goodreads. By acquiring Goodreads, Amazon eliminated the potential competition that could have arisen from its database of books and reviews.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the limitations of Goodreads' ranking system and suggests alternative methods for rating books. It points out that humans tend to rank items on a normal distribution, resulting in most books being ranked between 3.5 and 4.5 out of 5. The author argues that this is not an accurate representation of the average book, which should have a ranking of 2.5. The article suggests using a boolean rating system like Rotten Tomatoes, but notes that a sufficient number of reviews would be required for it to work effectively. The author also proposes a ranking system based on aggregated personal Elo, where users compare books they've read to determine which is better. This would provide a more comprehensive and robust ranking system compared to traditional star ratings.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the development and impact of Simula, an early programming language that laid the foundation for Object Oriented Programming (OOP). The first version of Simula appeared in 1962, focused on simulation and not yet object-oriented. However, Simula 67 was the first general-purpose object-oriented programming language. It then mentions the arrival of Java in 1991, which adopted the object model of Simula 67. The article provides a link to a talk given by James Gosling on Java's connection to Simula 67.

## 7. [AI and the Automation of Work](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36565854)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 The article discusses the impact of generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and ChatGPT on the future of automation and job displacement. It highlights that while new technologies have historically displaced certain jobs, they have also created new opportunities and increased overall prosperity. The author argues that automation, including advancements like LLMs, will likely follow this pattern. They refute the idea that there won't be new jobs created this time by referring to the 'Lump of Labour' fallacy, which suggests that as automation makes certain tasks more affordable and efficient, it leads to new jobs and economic growth. The article also explores the challenges and complexities of integrating LLMs into existing workflows and emphasizes the importance of time and adaptation in the process. Additionally, it discusses the potential limitations and error rates of LLMs, highlighting that they currently rely on matching patterns rather than truly understanding the information provided. The article concludes by addressing the hypothetical scenario of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), noting that without it, the impact of LLMs should be viewed as another wave of automation rather than a revolutionary shift in employment.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the advancements in AI technology and argues that any job that can be done by a non-human is up for grabs. It suggests that manual jobs, such as those in a kitchen or as a security guard, can be performed by machines as long as they are capable and safe. However, it also raises concerns about the impact on employment opportunities, as not everyone can access high-level jobs involving AI. Additionally, it mentions the negative effect of social media and AI on cognitive abilities, particularly for children. Overall, the article highlights both the possibilities and challenges associated with AI in the workforce.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author initially had high expectations for GPT-4 but ultimately unsubscribed from using it on ChatGPT Plus due to lack of use. They find the technology interesting but doubt its ability to replace most jobs in its current form. The author is unsure if further scaling will lead to job replacement and believes that additional AI breakthroughs will be necessary.

## 8. [The Xerox Smalltalk-80 GUI Was Weird](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36566638)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The author discusses their interest in the origins of object-oriented programming and design patterns like MVC. They wanted to fully understand these concepts by exploring the original Smalltalk-80 environment. They discovered a "by the Bluebook" implementation on GitHub which allowed them to emulate the original environment on modern hardware. The Smalltalk environment was different from traditional operating systems as it functioned more like an IDE running on bare hardware. It didn't have a file system and the entire state of the system was stored as Smalltalk objects. There were no desktops, icons, pull-down menus, or controls like we see in modern operating systems. Operations on windows were done modally, requiring users to click and select actions before executing them. The article concludes that while the Smalltalk environment was revolutionary, it was not user-friendly for regular people. Apple borrowed from the Smalltalk environment but made significant improvements to create a user-friendly graphical user interface for the Lisa and Macintosh.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the implementation and features of the Smalltalk-80 programming environment. It mentions an implementation of Smalltalk-80 called "by the Bluebook" and provides a link to its repository on GitHub. The author notes that although the Blue Book implementation is nice to use, it can be awkward because it requires a three-button mouse, which most people do not have. The article also addresses the argument that Smalltalk-80 is not an operating system but rather an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) running on bare hardware. The author disagrees, stating that Smalltalk-80 is indeed an operating system, although it may not have traditional barriers like a kernel. The article acknowledges that the Smalltalk environment was revolutionary but also notes that it might have been challenging for everyday users to operate. Additionally, the article mentions that the GitHub link provides early snapshots of Smalltalk-80, which may lack certain features added later, and highlights that the machines running Smalltalk-80 came with a manual explaining how to use the interface. The article also briefly mentions the Lisa computer and its expensive price, which some attribute to its commercial failure.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a demo of a Xerox workstation at PARC in 1982, similar to the one Steve Jobs saw. The author claims that the workstation was more advanced than suggested in the article. The office applications were built on top of the described system, providing necessary functionality. While the programmer interface was worse, the existing programs still got the work done. The Lisa end user experience was similar to the Xerox Alto, and the Mac made simplifications to improve usability.
