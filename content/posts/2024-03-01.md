## 2. [JPEG XL and the Pareto Front](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39559281)

**Total comment counts : 27**

### Summary

 Version 0.10 of libjxl, the reference implementation for JPEG XL, has been released. The main improvement in this version is the full implementation of the "streaming encoding" API, which allows for encoding large images in chunks, resulting in faster and more memory-friendly processing. In the previous version, lossless JPEG XL encoding was memory-intensive and time-consuming. However, with the upgrade to version 0.10, the same image that previously required 8 gigabytes of RAM for compression now only requires 0.7 gigabytes, takes 30 seconds using a single thread (or 5 seconds using eight threads), and results in a smaller file size. The article also discusses the trade-offs in compression settings and the concept of Pareto-optimal methods, which consider both compression density and encode speed. Overall, libjxl version 0.10 improves the efficiency of image encoding in terms of speed and memory usage.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

## 5. [Apple reverses course on death of Progressive Web Apps in EU](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39563618)

**Total comment counts : 31**

### Summary

 Apple has reversed its decision to remove Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in the European Union (EU) after receiving complaints. The company will restore the functionality of PWAs to how they worked in iOS 17.3 and earlier versions. Apple cited consumer requests as the reason for this change of direction. The reversal is reflected on Apple's page outlining the Digital Markets App changes. The EU's Digital Markets Act has an implementation deadline of March 8, and Apple's iOS 17.4 update, complying with the law, is expected to be available in early March. This update includes changes to app notarization, fee structures, and support for multiple browser engines. Apple's initial decision to remove PWAs sparked controversy and drew attention from European Commission authorities. Critics have called Apple's proposed fees extortion and malicious compliance. The initial beta release of iOS 17.4 caused problems with PWAs, but Apple has since addressed the issue based on consumer feedback.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) will still need to be built on WebKit for support, despite concerns about limited rendering engine competition. It questions if there was any communication between the EU and WebKit regarding this decision. The article indicates that the law only mandates changes to features that the EU deems important.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Apple and Digital Markets Act (DMA) officials had a dispute regarding Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) running on third-party browser engines. Apple claimed that they wouldn't be able to enforce certain privacy and security restrictions if PWAs were on a third-party browser engine. However, if DMA didn't require PWAs to run on third-party engines, Apple wouldn't have had any concerns. Apple justified their position by stating that Home Screen web apps are built directly on WebKit, aligning with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS.

## 7. [Streaming HTML out of order without JavaScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39560180)

**Total comment counts : 16**

### Summary

 The article discusses the concept of streaming HTML and how it can be achieved using Shadow DOM. Streaming HTML involves sending HTML from a web server to a browser in chunks as it is generated, allowing for immediate rendering and faster downloading of assets. However, streaming HTML out of order has been a challenge until now. The article introduces the use of Shadow DOM, a way to render a piece of DOM in isolation, to stream HTML out of order. This can be done by attaching a shadow root to a tag and rendering HTML into it using slots. The article also mentions the need for browsers that support streaming HTML and a templating language that supports streaming, such as SWTL. Additionally, the article discusses Declarative Shadow DOM, which allows for creating Shadow DOM on the server without JavaScript.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 This article discusses the introduction of a new HTML feature called shadowrootmode=open, which has been implemented in Chromium and Safari. It allows for the creation of native templates within HTML using the <template> tag and the use of slots to insert content. The author also expresses their desire for a native template system in HTML that supports URLs, similar to the <script> tag, which would facilitate building modular websites without scripts or server-side processing.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses how streamed content can react to interactions made by the user on the streamed page. This can be done through methods such as issuing an HTTP request back to the server and handling data in the next streamed chunk. This allows for various possibilities, including creating a "CSS only chat" or hiding old data using style directives in the new streamed chunk. The article provides a link to a CSS only chat example on GitHub.

## 9. [Study: 61 UK firms tried a 4-day workweek and after a year, they still love it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39562760)

**Total comment counts : 28**

### Summary

 A pilot program in the UK involving a four-day workweek has shown long-lasting benefits, according to researchers. In 2022, 61 companies moved their employees to a four-day workweek without reducing pay as part of a six-month experiment. Today, 54 of these companies still have the policy, with over half declaring it permanent. Follow-up surveys show that improvements in physical and mental health, work-life balance, and general life satisfaction have been maintained over the past year. Workers also report higher job satisfaction. Similar positive results are emerging from other four-day workweek trials in the US. Implementing a four-day workweek requires careful planning and adjustments to improve efficiency. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, as different companies find time savings in different areas. Some companies have found that a shorter workweek improves retention and employee motivation. However, communication with clients and stakeholders is crucial to manage expectations and make the policy successful.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the potential benefits of a four-day work week for both employees and corporations. It highlights employee retention as a clear advantage, as it provides a strong incentive for employees to stay with a company and allows them to gain valuable domain knowledge over time. However, the article also poses the question of whether the efficiency gains from a shorter work week justify the reduction in hours. The productivity of employees and the overall output of work is a crucial factor that needs to be objectively measured and evaluated. Shareholders are likely to prioritize this aspect when considering the implementation of a four-day work week.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights that there is no universal formula for implementing a four-day workweek. It questions whether the same understanding applies to the current five-day workweek and argues that the adoption of five days was arbitrary and required significant effort to deviate from the original six-day workweek. The article suggests that the persistence of the current system is due to inherited systems and the assumption that it is the ideal situation.
