**Total comment counts : 54**

### Summary

 Critics of the book "Abundance," particularly from the antitrust movement, argue that monopolies, especially in homebuilding, hinder construction and inflate prices. While proponents like Matt Stoller suggest that large builders manipulate supply for profit, journalist Basel Musharbash claims this trend in Dallas reflects monopolistic practices. However, research challenges these assertions, noting that homebuilder profits have remained steady, and Dallas's market does not meet oligopoly criteria. Overall, the article critiques Musharbash's piece and highlights flaws in the antitrust perspective on housing supply, emphasizing the need for accurate economic analysis.

## 9. [Gemini 2.5 Deep Think](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44755279)

**Total comment counts : 36**

### Summary

 Google has launched Deep Think in the Gemini app for its AI Ultra subscribers, incorporating feedback from early testers and advancements in AI research. This model, a faster variant of one that won gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad, enhances problem-solving through parallel thinking techniques. Deep Think provides creative, strategic responses and excels in various benchmarks, though it tends to refuse benign requests more often. Available for Google AI Ultra subscribers, it also supports tools like code execution and Google Search, with broader access planned for trusted testers via the Gemini API soon.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author experimented with Google's Deep Think agent but quickly reached the daily usage limit for the $250/month service. They find it underwhelming compared to competitors like o3-pro and Grok 4 Heavy. Despite expectations, the performance didn't justify the high price, as an alternative solution from o3 provided a similarly effective resolution for a lower cost. The author expresses disappointment over the perceived lack of value from a premium service that contrasts with Google’s free offerings in AI Studio. Further assessment is needed for deeper insights.

## 10. [Replacing cron jobs with a centralized task scheduler](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44713716)

**Total comment counts : 25**

### Summary

 Heartbeat has transitioned from managing multiple independent cron jobs for scheduled tasks to a centralized system using a single database table, ScheduledTasks. This new approach simplifies task management, allowing users to schedule tasks by inserting entries into the database. A single cron job executes these tasks every minute, with built-in retry logic for handling outages. The system manages task priorities using fields such as expirationInMinutes and expectedExecutionTimeInMinutes, ensuring timely execution and updates when task-related entities change. This streamlined process reduces errors and improves efficiency in managing tasks.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author comments on the importance of insightful discussions regarding technology, criticizing short, uninformative replies. They observe a trend where basic tools become overly complicated due to feature creep, as developers add functionalities to address operational issues. The author expresses curiosity about how long the original simplicity of the OP's solution will last before it succumbs to increasing complexity, emphasizing the value of maintaining straightforward solutions in development.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author suggests using a database's transactionality for task retries instead of a heuristic approach combined with SQS. The recommended method involves marking a task as 'executing' at the start, locking it with `SELECT FOR UPDATE ... SKIP LOCKED`, and marking it as 'COMPLETED' at the end. This allows for parallel processing directly from the database without the risk of duplicate task processing and enables easy detection of failed tasks without relying on heuristics.
