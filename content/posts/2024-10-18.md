## 7. [Smart pointers for the kernel](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41875792)

**Total comment counts : 5**

### Summary

 The Rust programming language features various smart pointers, including reference-counted pointers that are optimized by the compiler. The Rust-for-Linux project aims to incorporate custom smart pointers that align with the Linux kernel's memory model, a task currently done manually. Xiangfei Ding presented at Kangrejos about enabling these custom smart pointers to utilize the same powerful capabilities as built-in types, specifically "unsizing" and "dynamic dispatch."

Unsizing allows transformation of specific pointer types to be more flexible regarding array lengths, achieved by using "fat pointers." Meanwhile, dynamic dispatch enables the conversion of a pointer type to one that can invoke different methods at runtime, leveraging a dispatch table.

Both features remain experimental, with plans for an RFC (Request for Comments) that would simplify the implementation of necessary traits for custom smart pointers within the kernel, speeding up their adoption in stable Rust. However, safety concerns arise from potential misuse, such as malicious implementations of the Deref trait, which could disrupt memory safety, especially concerning the Pin type that prevents moving values in memory. To address this, a new unsafe marker trait is proposed, ensuring that programmers promise compliance with safety standards.

Ding indicated that while the new macro for these features is available in nightly Rust, further testing and documentation are required for stabilization, which he expects to complete soon.
