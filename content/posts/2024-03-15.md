**Total comment counts : 29**

### Summary

 A 2.5 million-acre region in southern Oregon, including Hart Mountain, Lake Abert, and Summer Lake, has been designated as the largest Dark Sky Sanctuary in the world. It was named the Oregon Outback International Dark Sky Sanctuary by DarkSky International, an organization dedicated to preserving dark skies. The project is a collaboration between various officials, individuals, business owners, and tourism agencies. Future plans aim to expand the sanctuary to 11.4 million acres. The Oregon sanctuary joins two other DarkSky International designations in the state. The area is known for its ideal conditions for stargazing and astronomical events. The expansion of the sanctuary is expected to be relatively straightforward with minimal local approvals and lighting changes required.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the idea that the reasoning pattern in LLM-based systems parallels Kahneman's two-system model of the mind. The model suggests that we use one system, called System 1, for low-effort, low-computation thinking, and another system, called System 2, for deliberate, conscious, high-cognitive tasks. The article suggests that the criticism that LLMs are not intelligent because they are stochastic parrots is based on the observation that they are only equipped to use System 1. When we prompt an LLM to think step-by-step, we allow it to use a rudimentary System 2, similar to a deliberation sandbox. The article also discusses how our own System 2 works by simulating the environment and exploring a tree of possibilities to decide the most rewarding action. The author suggests that a similar framework may be incorporated into future models, particularly in robotics.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article suggests that deep neural networks have a limited ability to reason symbolically, as they can only reason about symbolic questions for a certain number of "steps." The complexity that appears to exist beyond these steps is actually due to the model being trained in multiple subspaces. In contrast, humans can reason beyond these steps but it requires real thinking, deliberation, and sometimes the use of a notepad. The article highlights the challenge of expecting models like ChatGPT to perform complex tasks, such as solving 4-digit multiplication, without any human-like thinking or the aid of pen and paper.
