## 1. [Tailscale state file encryption no longer enabled by default](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46531925)

**Total comment counts : 10**

### Summary

 The update notes announce new releases for Tailscale’s container image, Kubernetes Operator, and tsrecorder, with download links from Docker Hub and GitHub packages. Installation and updating guidance is available in the official instructions. Several releases note only library updates or release-candidate status (e.g., v1.92.0, 1.90.0). A general note says most users don’t need firewall changes; see the firewall ports guide for details. In short, there are ongoing component updates, mostly non-functional library updates.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: Tailscale disabled the default for node state encryption and hardware attestation (TPMs) in 1.92.5 due to the feature being too support-intensive and unreliable across a heterogeneous device fleet.
- Concern: The main worry is that enabling this feature by default caused widespread breakage and security risk for many devices, leading to silent failures or unstable deployments.
- Perspectives: Some engineers argue TPM-based protection is too maintenance-heavy and unreliable across diverse hardware, while security-conscious admins want clear opt-in or default-enabled safeguards, and many users are frustrated and hoping for a timely re-enablement with proper guidance.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 5. [Eat Real Food](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46529237)

**Total comment counts : 103**

### Summary

 New Dietary Guidelines redefine “real food” as whole, nutrient-dense, minimally processed. It rejects decades of processed-food emphasis and stresses a science-based, common-sense approach. It prioritizes high-quality protein (1.2–1.6 g/kg/day) from animal and plant sources, paired with healthy fats from whole foods like eggs, seafood, dairy, nuts, and avocados. Emphasis on vegetables (3 servings) and fruits (2 servings) daily, with fiber-rich whole grains (2–4 servings) and limited refined carbs. Added sugars are discouraged; hydration should be water. The New Pyramid is a flexible framework to eat real foods most of the time.

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The thread analyzes US dietary guidelines, meat consumption trends, processed foods, and the government's role in public nutrition.
- Concern: The main worry is that political agendas and industry lobbying could distort guidelines and reduce their impact.
- Perspectives: Viewpoints range from distrust of government guidance and industry influence to support for protein-first or "eat real food" approaches, with emphasis on accessibility, personal experience, and the complexity of nutrition.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed

## 9. [Native Amiga Filesystems on macOS / Linux / Windows with FUSE](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46473726)

**Total comment counts : 4**

### Summary

 amifuse enables native Amiga filesystems on macOS, Linux, and Windows via FUSE by running actual Amiga filesystem drivers (e.g., PFS3) through M68k emulation, so you can read Amiga disk images without reverse engineering. Install macFUSE (osxfuse) or via Homebrew, reboot if needed to allow the kernel extension. Download a test PFS3 disk image and the pfs3aio handler, then mount with amifuse. Subcommands view partition info and embedded drivers, inspect RDB images, and verify handler binaries. The --icons flag converts Amiga .info icons to Finder icons (experimental, macOS-only).

### Overall Comments Summary

- Main point: The discussion centers on cross-platform filesystem compatibility, highlighting Amiga's extensible, pluggable filesystem architecture and the potential to run AmigaDOS/68K code to access other filesystems across systems.
- Concern: The main worry is that true universal cross-OS filesystem support remains unresolved, with Mac/Linux/Windows gaps and NTFS being read-only on macOS limiting practicality.
- Perspectives: Views range from admiration for Amiga's design and emulation-based approaches to cautious optimism about whether such methods can ever deliver seamless, native-like cross-OS access.
- Overall sentiment: Mixed
