## 5. [Cosmological time dilation in the early Universe](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37214693)

**Total comment counts : 26**

### Summary

 Scientists have discovered that time ran five times slower 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang compared to today, confirming Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. The discovery of cosmological time dilation in the early universe was made by astrophysicist Geraint Lewis and statistician Brendon Brewer. They observed that the further back they looked into the universe, the slower things seemed to occur. This time dilation is attributed to the expansion of space itself. The researchers used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study nearly 200 quasars and reveal the time dilation when the universe was just 1.5 billion years old. The discovery confirms Einstein's predictions and supports the understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the concept of time and its relationship to the speed of the universe.

Hoogle allows users to search for information about what can be done in Haskell based on their desired functionality. The article mentions attempts made to create similar tools for other languages like Rust and Nim, but none have achieved the same level of utility as Hoogle. The author expresses frustration with the lack of comparable tooling in other languages, particularly when dealing with complex code structures. Alongside Hoogle, the author criticizes the tooling ecosystem in Haskell, stating that it lacks redeeming qualities and emphasizes the community's focus on innovation rather than improvement.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author of the article, who has been writing Haskell for about a decade, agrees with the first point made by the author, which is that the Haskell community values learning. However, they believe that the community is not good at discarding ideas that don't work, leading to professional Haskell codebases that contain unnecessary elements. The author disagrees with the claim that Haskell's tooling is lacking, and suggests that tooling in most other languages is also subpar. They mention missing the Haskell toolchain after using other languages like Python, JavaScript, and Java. They also note the author's dismay with Python, but see things in a more positive light.

## 10. [ChatGPT turned generative AI into an “anything tool”](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37236027)

**Total comment counts : 15**

### Summary

 AI models have traditionally been specialized tools, trained specifically for certain tasks or areas. However, recent advancements in generative AI, such as ChatGPT, have shown that these models can be used for a wide range of applications without being explicitly trained for them. This shift towards general-purpose AI has the potential to significantly increase productivity and efficiency. Generative AI models, like GPT4, work probabilistically, predicting the likelihood of certain words or phrases given an input and generating an output based on that prediction. While this probabilistic nature can lead to unpredictability, it also allows for flexibility and power that rule-based systems lack. By shaping the randomness of AI models in a useful way, their productivity can be maximized. Just as physicists have learned to embrace and utilize the randomness of the quantum world, we can learn to harness the potential of generative AI. The training process for AI models involves gradient descent, adjusting the parameters of neural networks to make the outputs more closely resemble the training data. This iterative process leads to incremental improvements and eventually produces coherent output. The same technique can be applied to other types of data, such as pictures and DNA sequences. Overall, the shift towards general-purpose AI opens up new possibilities and opportunities for harnessing the power of AI in various fields.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author expresses concern about the sustainability of ChatGPT's current performance and cost structure. They mention that while they pay for the premium version, most users do not, leading to potential financial losses. They speculate that competitors may reduce expensive hardware and energy usage for the free tier, which could result in lower-quality responses. The author also draws a comparison to the decline in quality of responses from other voice assistants, attributing it to cost-cutting measures. They suggest that ChatGPT may require powerful hardware to maintain its current response times, but this could be economically challenging. Ultimately, the author suggests that either a technological breakthrough is needed to reduce costs or the quality of responses may decline.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author predicts that websites like StackOverflow, Wikipedia, IMDB, and Goodreads may develop their own AI interfaces in the future. They compare this to the evolution of cable TV and Netflix, where initially cable was fractured and expensive, but Netflix consolidated it into a cheap and unified service. However, over time, the streaming market became fragmented and expensive again. The author expresses enthusiasm for AI interfaces like chatgpt but also points out that the novelty wears off quickly.
