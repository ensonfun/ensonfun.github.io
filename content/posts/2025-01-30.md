### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the evolution of PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design, particularly focusing on the use of copper pours. Historically, in the 1990s, PCB designers would mask large unused areas of copper to conserve etching acid, which was expensive and had a limited lifespan based on the amount of copper it could remove. This practice also helped manage the etching process in DIY settings where conditions were not tightly controlled. DIY etching often involved basic, budget-friendly methods like using room temperature ferric chloride in simple containers, with various rudimentary techniques to apply etch resist. Masking large copper areas ensured that all copper traces were of similar width, reducing the risk of over-etching delicate parts of the PCB. Nowadays, with advancements in PCB manufacturing technology and reduced costs at professional services like PCBWay or JLCPCB, such concerns are largely obsolete due to much more controlled and efficient processes.

## 7. [Proper decoupling capacitor practices, and why you should leave 100nF behind](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42830948)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article delves into why the common practice of using 100nF capacitors for decoupling in electronic circuits, particularly microcontrollers, is outdated. Here's a summary:

- **Decoupling Capacitors**: These are used to manage the dynamic load currents in digital circuits. Every time transistors in a microcontroller switch states, they require current, leading to a need for stable power supply conditions.

- **Problem with 100nF Capacitors**: While 100nF capacitors were widely used, they are not as effective as previously thought for modern applications due to changes in technology and understanding of circuit behavior.

- **Dynamic Currents (dI/dt)**: The article explains that the rate of change of current (dI/dt) is crucial in digital circuits, not just the clock frequency. This rate determines the frequency components that need to be managed by decoupling capacitors.

- **Rise and Fall Times**: The speed at which signals rise or fall (rise/fall time) dictates the necessary bandwidth for decoupling, rather than the clock frequency itself. For example, a 1ns rise time requires handling frequencies up to about 350MHz.

- **Parasitic Effects**: The physical distance between the power supply and the device, along with parasitic inductance and resistance in the circuit traces, can degrade power delivery. Inductance, in particular, causes voltage drops that manifest as noise on power rails.

- **Outdated Practice**: The article argues that the traditional approach of using 100nF capacitors, or even adding larger capacitors in parallel, does not sufficiently address these issues due to the underestimation of parasitic effects and the actual frequency components involved in modern digital circuits.

The piece suggests a need for reevaluating decoupling strategies to better match the demands of current technology, highlighting that while 100nF capacitors have been a staple, their effectiveness is limited by today's circuit requirements and parasitic effects.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses best practices for selecting and placing capacitors in electronic circuits:

1. **Capacitor Value**: While 1uF or 2.2uF capacitors are commonly recommended, modern designs often use higher capacitance values as engineering knowledge has advanced beyond outdated norms.

2. **Package Size**: Larger capacitors, despite offering more capacitance, can degrade high-frequency performance due to their physical size. For very high-speed designs, smaller packages like 0201 capacitors are preferred.

3. **Distribution**: Instead of using a single large capacitor, multiple smaller capacitors (e.g., 100nF) should be distributed around the PCB. This ensures effective decoupling by keeping capacitors close to the components they are intended to stabilize.

4. **Practical Considerations**: For hobbyist projects or simple microcontroller applications, exact capacitor placement and size are less critical. However, for high-speed circuits, careful consideration of capacitor placement, the number and size of vias, and minimizing loop areas are essential to maintain signal integrity.

In summary, while general guidelines exist, the specifics of capacitor use in circuit design can significantly impact performance, particularly in high-speed applications where every detail matters.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article criticizes advice to increase capacitor size from 100nF to 1uF in USB-powered devices. Here are the main points:

1. **Peak Currents and USB Specifications**: The author argues that using larger capacitors can exceed USB power limits, potentially damaging ports or hubs due to power surge issues when devices are connected.

2. **Capacitance Limits**: Due to these limits, smaller capacitors like 100nF are preferred over larger ones like 1uF, as they add up less quickly when multiple decoupling capacitors are needed across a board.

3. **Frequency Response**: The article's complaint about 100nF capacitors having their filtering peak at the wrong frequency is countered by the argument that this range (20MHz to 40MHz) aligns well with the operational frequencies of modern ICs, making 100nF capacitors more suitable than 1uF.

4. **IC Compatibility**: Examples like the PCM5242 IC, which has switching times suggesting the use of 100nF capacitors, support the use of smaller caps for better performance with modern electronics.

5. **Contextual Relevance**: The advice to use larger capacitors might be suitable for devices with slower ICs and dedicated power supplies, but not for USB-powered devices with modern ICs where smaller capacitors are more effective. 

In summary, the author believes that for USB-powered devices using modern ICs, sticking with 100nF capacitors rather than upgrading to 1uF is more appropriate due to practical considerations in power management and IC performance.
