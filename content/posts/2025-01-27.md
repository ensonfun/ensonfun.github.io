  - A macOS application for viewing the last known location of devices.
  - Firmware that enables Bluetooth devices to broadcast beacons, making them discoverable by iPhones.

- **Setup**: 
  - Requires macOS 11 (Big Sur) and involves generating a key pair for each device, with the private key stored securely on the Mac and the public key deployed on the device.
  - A custom plugin for Apple Mail is needed to interact with Apple's private API for retrieving location data.

- **Security and Privacy**: 
  - The project involved reverse-engineering Apple’s offline finding system, leading to the discovery and subsequent patching of vulnerabilities by Apple.
  - OpenHaystack emphasizes that it does not access private data beyond what is necessary for its functionality.

- **Limitations**: 
  - The software is experimental, with incomplete features, and devices currently broadcast a fixed public key, potentially allowing tracking by others.

- **Non-Affiliation**: OpenHaystack is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.

The project has garnered media attention and provides a detailed technical explanation of how it integrates with Apple's system, including cryptographic methods and the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for location broadcasting.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the issues with Google's version of a device tracking network for non-Apple users, highlighting several shortcomings:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Google limits how often users can search for their own tags.
2. **Location Visibility**: The location of a tag isn't shown until it has been detected by multiple phones, which delays the process.
3. **Poor Coverage**: There's a noted lack of coverage for Google's network, despite the potential for wide Android user base.

Interestingly, tests have shown that Samsung's network performs better than Google's, which seems counterintuitive given that Samsung phones are part of the broader Android ecosystem. This suggests that Google's implementation has been poorly executed compared to Apple's, even years after Apple demonstrated an effective model. The article provides links to further reading on Google's security and privacy protections for their Find My Device network, stress tests on the tracking network, and comparisons with Apple's AirTag.
