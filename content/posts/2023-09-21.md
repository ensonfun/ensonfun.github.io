## 4. [UK Parliament undermined the privacy, security, freedom of all internet users](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37592699)

**Total comment counts : 46**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Online Safety Bill (OSB) that has been passed by the U.K. Parliament. It argues that the bill will impose censorship and restrict internet access for British users. One concerning aspect of the bill is the provision that allows the telecom regulator, Ofcom, to require tech companies to scan their users for child abuse content, even if the messages and files are encrypted. This raises privacy and security concerns and undermines the right to private conversations. The OSB also gives the government power to force companies to build technology that can bypass encryption, essentially creating a backdoor. The article expresses concerns about the potential politicized censorship decisions and harmful age-verification systems that may result from the bill. It concludes that encrypted messaging services may withdraw from the U.K. if the government compromises their ability to protect users.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The U.K. Parliament has passed the Online Safety Bill (OSB) with the aim of making the U.K. the safest place to be online. However, critics argue that the politicians involved are ill-equipped to handle tech-related matters and caution against potential misuse of the bill. One provision of the bill allows British telecom regulator Ofcom to require tech companies to scan all their users for child abuse content, a move reminiscent of Apple's CSAM controversy. Concerns are raised about the expansion of such scanning to other areas like terrorism, crime, political views, and hate speech. This legislation could also require companies to build backdoor technology that undermines user privacy, even for messages and files that are end-to-end encrypted. As a result, some individuals may consider moving to end-to-end encryption via private servers.

## 6. [Introduction to Linux interfaces for virtual networking (2018)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37582632)

**Total comment counts : 7**

### Summary

 This article provides a brief introduction to commonly used virtual network interface types in Linux. It covers interfaces such as Linux bridge, bonding, team, VLAN, VXLAN, MACVLAN, IPVLAN, MACVTAP/IPVTAP, MACsec, VETH, VCAN, VXCAN, IPOIB, NLMON, dummy interface, IFB, and netdevsim. The article explains what each interface is, their differences, when to use them, and how to create them.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the use of SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) as a method of improving network performance in virtual machines. SR-IOV allows a single hardware device, such as a network card, to act as multiple virtual devices. Each virtual device is passed to a guest virtual machine as a PCIe device, allowing it to be treated as a hardware device within the VM. This eliminates the need for using software-based VirtIO drivers.

The article explains that using SR-IOV can help overcome issues with hardware acceleration when using a Linux software bridge, which can limit the device's bandwidth. Additionally, it reduces overhead during the VM transition process. Another advantage of SR-IOV mentioned is that it does not require changing the network configuration on the host machine. 

While SR-IOV is supported on some consumer motherboards, enabling it may require modifying the BIOS configuration.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

However, they are unsure about a book that covers the fundamentals of Linux interfaces for virtual networking.

## 7. [How Equifax Was Breached in 2017](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37592934)

**Total comment counts : 19**

### Summary

 The article discusses the Equifax data breach in 2017, which affected 163 million customers and is considered one of the largest data breaches in history. The breach was a result of vulnerabilities in the Apache Struts software, specifically CVE-2017-5638, which allowed hackers to execute remote code on Equifax servers. Despite efforts to patch the affected applications, one legacy application called the Automated Consumer Interview System (ACIS) was overlooked and remained vulnerable. Attackers gained access to ACIS and used web shells to maintain control of the system. They then discovered a file share containing database credentials, allowing them to access and exfiltrate personal identifiable information (PII) from 48 different databases. The stolen data was divided into compressed files and placed in publicly accessible directories on web servers to be gradually exfiltrated without triggering alerts. Equifax only realized the breach after their Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) SSL certificate expired, preventing them from monitoring the ACIS environment. The breach was eventually discovered and ACIS was shut down, but by then, the attackers had already collected data from 163 million customers. The article concludes by highlighting the mistakes made by Equifax and the importance of learning from them to prevent similar incidents in the future.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The article discusses a detailed breach report and highlights a concerning quote about how attackers found database credentials stored in plaintext on a shared file server belonging to Equifax. The author expresses their own worries about application security, but upon reading about common security issues like storing credentials in plaintext and not using strong passwords or two-factor authentication, they feel somewhat relieved that their own security practices aren't as bad.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 This article discusses a group that exploited a vulnerability and handed over information to PLA-linked individuals who conducted exfiltration. It mentions that the data has not been seen on the open market, raising concerns about potential compromise of individuals for commercial and military espionage purposes. The author speculates that this information might have been known early on and possibly considered in a settlement.

**Total comment counts : 53**

### Summary

 The article discusses the changes made to Delta Air Lines' SkyMiles program, which now focuses on dollars spent rather than miles traveled. The author argues that frequent-flier programs are a symptom of deeper issues in the American air-travel industry, and the blame ultimately lies with Congress. The article traces the evolution of frequent-flier programs, highlighting how they have become lucrative financial systems for airlines. However, the system is not necessarily beneficial for all consumers, as credit-card swipe fees increase prices across the economy. The article also criticizes the lack of competition in the airline industry and the negative effects of deregulation. Ultimately, the author suggests that airlines should be regulated to focus on improving air travel instead of financial gains.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 I apologize, but I am unable to access the links you provided. Can you please provide a brief summary or any specific details from the article?

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s and its effects on air travel. Previously, the federal government regulated airlines as a public utility, deciding which airlines could fly certain routes and set prices. However, in 1978, Congress passed a law that deregulated the industry and abolished the regulatory board. This led to a decrease in the real cost of air travel, as airlines were able to experiment with routes and offer competitive incentives. Air travel became more popular and safer, although service quality declined. The author acknowledges that there may be some issues with customer and worker protections, but overall, airline deregulation demonstrates the drawbacks of command economies in planning and resource allocation.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The importance of having a smart lead engineer working closely with the product team and involved in the higher level roadmap is highlighted in this article. Without this collaboration, engineers may struggle as there won't be an advocate for their needs and an understanding of what can be realistically achieved. The relationship between engineers and non-technical decision-makers can become toxic and one-sided.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses the importance of connecting product roadmaps to the higher-level mission, vision, and strategy of a company. It suggests that while it is good for engineers to align with strategy, this should be primarily done by the Chief Product Officer (CPO) and the leadership team. The article questions whether it is wise to educate product managers on strategy if it does not resonate with the engineers. It also mentions that successful companies often only develop a written mission and strategy in the scale-up phase when stakeholders require more clarification.
