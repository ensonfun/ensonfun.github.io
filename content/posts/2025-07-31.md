**Total comment counts : 111**

### Summary

 The article emphasizes the importance of speed in software, noting that fast applications can significantly enhance user experience and productivity. Speed encourages frequent deployment, fosters innovation, and eliminates cognitive friction, making tasks more efficient and enjoyable. Despite its value, speed is often overlooked in favor of additional features. Fast software typically results from focused design, as it necessitates stripping away non-essential elements. The article suggests that as the emphasis on performance increases, we will see more tools optimized for low latency, enhancing user experience and unlocking new capabilities in software development.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author reflects on the inefficiency of LLM-assisted workflows compared to traditional IDE features. They experienced significant delays when using an "agentic" assistant to create an HTTP endpoint, initially thinking it saved time but later realizing it resulted in convoluted logic and poor error handling. Ultimately, they spent five hours recoding, yielding a more robust solution with improved testing. This illustrates that while AI tools can accelerate some tasks, the output may require substantial manual effort to ensure quality.

 Japan has issued tsunami forecasts of up to 3 meters for its entire eastern coast, with first waves expected within 10 minutes. The area is densely populated and recalls the devastating 2011 tsunami. However, early reports indicate a maximum wave height of only 40 cm in Japan, while Kamchatka, Russia, experienced higher waves of 3-4 meters. As the situation develops, it appears unlikely that significant damage will occur.

## 5. [Vibe code is legacy code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44739556)

**Total comment counts : 77**

### Summary

 Andrej Karpathy introduced "vibe coding," an AI-assisted approach where developers overlook the underlying code. This can lead to technical debt, especially if the code becomes complex and difficult to maintain. While vibe coding is effective for prototypes, it poses risks when non-programmers attempt large projects, similar to misuse of a credit card without understanding debt. Successful coding requires both technical understanding and cautious application of AI tools. It's essential for developers to read and comprehend code rather than relying solely on AI, as eventual maintenance often necessitates a solid foundation of sound coding principles.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 A non-technical friend successfully launched a SaaS product last year, generating revenue through word of mouth in a niche market, using Replit and Supabase. However, incumbent competitors hired hackers to undermine his product, leading to a user list leak and unauthorized refunds. Despite the insecure, "vibe-coded" software, he quickly validated a viable business model. He plans to hire a developer to improve the app's security, affirming that the investment was worthwhile despite the challenges.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 Historically, non-technical individuals have developed applications using tools like Microsoft Access and Excel, leading to various limitations and maintenance issues. However, this trend also pushed professionals to improve their offerings and address the shortcomings of these unsanctioned tools. A similar situation occurred with the rise of personal computers, which frustrated mainframe professionals due to the unprofessional applications being created.

## 6. [The Math Is Haunted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44739315)

**Total comment counts : 23**

### Summary

 Lean is a programming language primarily used by mathematicians to formalize mathematics as code, making knowledge verifiable and composable. It allows users to treat mathematical statements as theorems with proofs, utilizing tactics to close goals, such as proving "2 = 2" with built-in reflexivity (rfl). The article highlights the flexibility of mathematics through Lean, emphasizing that while false statements, like "2 = 3," shouldn't be provable, the concept of proof evolves with its context. Lean’s approach merges programming and mathematical rigor, aiming to digitalize humanity's mathematical knowledge.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 The author suggests using a Lean-like methodology to rewrite news and non-fiction articles, treating claims as theorems that require proof through citations. This approach would allow for a marked-up document that highlights "proven" statements, enhancing the rigor of information presented. While acknowledging it may not be perfect, the author believes it could restore the accountability once maintained by publications.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The author critiques the description of the two_eq_two theorem as resembling a function, arguing it resembles a constant since it lacks arguments. They suggest an alternative presentation where a theorem x_eq_x is defined as a function, allowing for a more convincing proof of 2_eq_2 by applying x_eq_x with the argument 2, thereby reinforcing the functional appearance.

## 7. [Ollama's new app](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44739632)

 Ollama has launched a new app for macOS and Windows that allows users to download and chat with models, featuring file drag-and-drop for easier document processing. Users can increase context length for larger documents, though this requires more memory. The app supports image inputs for compatible models, like Google DeepMind’s Gemma 3, and can process code files. Users can download the app from Ollama's website or access pure CLI versions via Ollama’s GitHub releases page.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Ollama has shifted its focus from developers to regular users, as indicated by changes on its homepage. Previously centered on CLI versions for developers, these are now mentioned only in relation to standalone downloads on GitHub. The author plans to explore Ollama after testing local LLM apps like LM Studio and Msty. They suggest adding a feature similar to ChatGPT's desktop app, which allows users to open a new chat quickly (using Alt + Space) for efficiency.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article discusses criticisms of Ollama's practices regarding model management in the AI community, highlighting concerns over vendor lock-in, closed-source modifications, mixed performance of models, and opaque naming conventions that confuse users. It also mentions difficulties in managing context window settings while using Ollama. Alternatives to Ollama suggested include llama.cpp, a high-performance fork of it, and tools like llama-swap, LM Studio, and Open WebUI, which promote openness and better performance.

### Top 1 Comment Summary

 Researchers have potentially solved the mystery of why sleep is necessary, showing that mild uncoupling in sleep-inducing neurons of fruit flies helps keep them awake by lowering mitochondrial Δp and reducing electron leak. This suggests a biochemical basis for sleep, which could lead to targeted wakefulness-promoting drugs for humans. The findings also raise questions about deep versus light sleepers and individual sleep needs, suggesting these traits may be adjustable.

### Top 2 Comment Summary

 The article highlights a captivating sentence about electron flow in respiratory chains, likening it to sand in an hourglass that signifies the need for balance. This phrase is celebrated as a new favorite among quotes from academic papers, eclipsing a previous favorite remark by Mark Thomas about a "Lord of the Rings-type world" discussed during a Royal Society meeting in 2012/13.
